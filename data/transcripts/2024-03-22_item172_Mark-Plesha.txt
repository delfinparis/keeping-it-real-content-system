[00:01:31] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by Real
[00:01:36] Estate Agents.
[00:01:37] And for Real Estate Agents, my name is DJ Paris.
[00:01:40] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:01:41] And just a moment, we're going to be speaking with up and coming top producer Mark Plesha.
[00:01:47] Before we get to Mark, just a few reminders, please, as always, tell a friend about our
[00:01:52] show.

[00:02:10] But enough from me.
[00:02:12] Let's get to the main event.
[00:02:13] And then, my conversation with Mark Plesha.
[00:02:28] Today on the show, my guest is Mark Plesha with broker works in Highland, Indiana.
[00:02:34] That's Northwest Indiana, by the way.
[00:02:36] Let me tell you more about Mark.
[00:02:38] Now, after listening to countless episodes of bigger pockets, podcasts, which by the way,
[00:02:43] I've had the bigger pockets guys on our show as well, bigger pockets for those of you that
[00:02:46] aren't less that aren't familiar is the nation's largest online forum for real estate investors.
[00:02:52] So check out bigger pockets.
[00:02:54] But Mark is listening to countless episodes, bigger pockets.
[00:02:57] And after purchasing two rental properties, Mark decided to transition from his W2 job selling
[00:03:03] into selling real estate in the beginning of 2020 right in the middle of the start of
[00:03:09] the pandemic.
[00:03:10] He got licensed in July of that year.
[00:03:12] And in his first full year during the pandemic, Mark closed dramatic pause for effect 32 transactions
[00:03:21] for a little over 6 million in sales, 32 transactions in his first year while only working, and
[00:03:29] this is the even crazier part, only working 30 hours a week.
[00:03:32] His early successes were largely due to a focused direct outbound prospecting campaign and
[00:03:38] also being very diligent in protecting his time for income practice or producing activities.
[00:03:44] And in 2022, Mark closed over 8 million and was the top agent in his office.
[00:03:49] Mark was raised and currently resides in Highland, Indiana with his beautiful flight Liz and
[00:03:55] therefore children.
[00:03:57] I want everybody to visit Mark's website for broker works, which is move to Highland.com.
[00:04:04] And specifically, I want you to look at how Mark and his team are really targeting people who
[00:04:10] are looking to move to Highland.
[00:04:13] And they have a whole brand built around that.
[00:04:15] And we're going to talk about that.
[00:04:16] Say, Mark, welcome to the show.
[00:04:18] Yeah, thank you for the intro DJ.
[00:04:20] And like you said, listen, a lot of podcasts years, years was definitely one of them.
[00:04:24] And I think that's definitely playing the success.
[00:04:27] So thank you for everything that you do for the community.
[00:04:29] Yeah, I'm just hopefully I can give back, give back some tidbits and hopefully help some agents out.
[00:04:35] And congratulations to you.
[00:04:36] You have the best podcast voice of all time.
[00:04:38] So good to see you, sir.
[00:04:40] Well, that's debatable, but I'll take the compliment.
[00:04:43] Thank you.
[00:04:44] There you go.
[00:04:44] And I don't know that I'm the best host.
[00:04:47] Maybe I have the best voice, but I don't know if I have the best host.
[00:04:49] But I will do my best.
[00:04:51] We will do our best for our audience today.
[00:04:54] Thanks for being here.
[00:04:55] Yeah, so Mark has such a cool story because he's really doing things that I think a lot of agents aren't doing.
[00:05:03] And so we're certainly going to get to that.
[00:05:04] But Mark, let's talk about why the shift into real estate.
[00:05:07] So you've been licensed as 2020.
[00:05:09] What got you there?
[00:05:11] Yeah.
[00:05:12] And you know, off the top of the mind, you start thinking, you know, I have an interesting story.
[00:05:16] But then you start listing 100s and 100s of podcasts with agents interviewed.
[00:05:19] And everyone's got an interesting story, right?
[00:05:22] No one except for there's the occasional guest.
[00:05:25] One out of every 100 like, oh, yeah, my grandpa started RE/MAX.
[00:05:28] So I was born into it.
[00:05:29] Like that happens.
[00:05:30] But that's not the few of those.
[00:05:31] Yeah.
[00:05:32] There's a few of those.
[00:05:33] I've heard a few interesting stories, right?
[00:05:35] But like we're all an interesting breed.
[00:05:37] I feel like we got into this.
[00:05:39] This is usually second third career.
[00:05:40] And so it's always interesting to listen to other people's stories.
[00:05:44] It's mind's not anything crazy.
[00:05:47] You know, I was a union laborer prior to getting into real estate.
[00:05:51] I worked for a family business that my wife's father owned.
[00:05:56] Just super blessed to be able to be into that position and get hired there.
[00:05:59] And they gave me an opportunity that I probably didn't deserve.
[00:06:01] So, you know, I'm incredibly grateful for that opportunity.
[00:06:05] But quickly on, I kind of realized, you know, this wasn't for me.
[00:06:08] This isn't where I saw myself ending up and being happy for the next 20, 30 years
[00:06:14] until retirement.
[00:06:16] So I had a lot of conversations with my wife, which you can imagine.
[00:06:20] The little difficult conversations.
[00:06:24] Very, yeah, there's just some things that we knew would have to navigate.
[00:06:28] That might not be easy.
[00:06:30] But we ultimately came to the conclusion after, like I said, I had downtime at that job
[00:06:36] within certain aspects of it.
[00:06:38] And I delve deep into podcasts.
[00:06:40] So first ones, bigger pockets and then got into real estate investing a little bit.
[00:06:45] And, you know, I was just driving down the road one day and thinking to myself, you know,
[00:06:50] I kind of started to get that bug of being an entrepreneur.
[00:06:52] They pushed the book over to Port Ed, really hard in that podcast.
[00:06:56] So I read that book and, you know, I was just silly because for months,
[00:07:00] I'm like, what could I do?
[00:07:01] Like what business could I start going through all these conversations in my head?
[00:07:05] And finally, just driving down the road one day, I'm like, you idiot, like going to
[00:07:09] real estate full time, like get licensed and be a real estate agent.
[00:07:13] It's everything, all that information and knowledge I already acquired through all
[00:07:17] those podcasts, all that translates.
[00:07:20] So I say right around December 2019, I finally made the decision like, okay, we're all on
[00:07:25] board with this.
[00:07:26] You know, we were always pretty good sabers.
[00:07:28] We try to live off like 50% of our income.
[00:07:31] So we, I think that's super important to, for me, there's no going back.
[00:07:37] If I made the jump, I was, I was going full in and I was making that jump and I wasn't
[00:07:41] going back.
[00:07:42] Would they have me back?
[00:07:43] I'm sure.
[00:07:44] But in my mind, I'm like, I can't, just there's a pride thing there, right?
[00:07:47] Like I can't go back.
[00:07:50] So knowing that and knowing, yeah, just making that leap and that jump, you know,
[00:07:56] just the sink or sling.
[00:07:58] Yeah, I make it work.
[00:07:58] So you went from really working with your hands and being, you know, being, you know,
[00:08:05] your wife's family's business and switching over into, you know, you started studying
[00:08:10] about real estate investing via bigger pockets and other podcasts and a lot of agents, sorry,
[00:08:16] a lot of investors will get their real estate license even just to do their own transactions
[00:08:20] for their own investments because, of course, you save on the commission pretty, you know,
[00:08:26] just did your own investments.
[00:08:27] It would still make sense to get your license.
[00:08:29] But like, oh, by the way, now I can also help other people do all sorts of transactions
[00:08:33] as well.
[00:08:34] And you really did hit the ground running.
[00:08:37] I have, I don't know that I've ever met anyone who did 32 transactions in their first
[00:08:42] year.
[00:08:42] That is incredible.
[00:08:44] And I'm sure our audience is dying to know how did you do that?
[00:08:49] Yeah.
[00:08:50] And going back a little bit into the, the old career, right?
[00:08:53] Like, one of the big instances for me was I, two kids at the time, I was working 50,
[00:08:58] 60 hours a week, sometimes 70, 80.
[00:09:01] I never knew my schedule.
[00:09:02] You know, so that time with my family was important.
[00:09:06] And so going into, I think that was a hindrance for me of making that switch was, okay, how
[00:09:10] do I, if I do want to reduce my work hours, like, I got to go into this intentionally because
[00:09:16] the big thing holding me back was, you know, you, you think about real estate agents and
[00:09:20] your schedule, they're probably working nights and weekends.
[00:09:24] So working through that thought process and kind of working backwards of, okay, what do
[00:09:28] I want my career to look like?
[00:09:29] I want to have my time available to me.
[00:09:32] So just listening to a podcast, I'm going to always reference back to that because there's
[00:09:36] so many countless podcasts that got me to where I am and kind of reverse engineering the
[00:09:41] business of, okay, if I don't want to be doing showings and nights and weekends, how do
[00:09:45] I control my schedule as much as possible?
[00:09:47] Listings, right?
[00:09:48] So then working through that, what are my lead sources that I can, as a new agent, I can
[00:09:53] jump right into calling for sale banners, calling cancels, calling expires.
[00:09:58] Later on, I got into probate leads.
[00:10:01] And then the other facet of the business that you can kind of dictate your own schedule,
[00:10:05] which I already had somewhat of an intimate knowledge and was working with investors.
[00:10:09] So actually early on, I got connected with an investor who was out of state.
[00:10:14] I would go look at the properties for him on my own time.
[00:10:17] So again, I'm in control of my schedule.
[00:10:20] And that's kind of where you mentioned in my intro, working that 30 hour a week schedule,
[00:10:28] that's what allowed me to do that.
[00:10:29] I was probably 60, 40 listings in that first year.
[00:10:33] And I would say three quarters of the buyers that I had were working with investors.
[00:10:39] So I was home a lot with my kids, which yeah, it was a blessing.
[00:10:46] I mean, that's all I can say.
[00:10:47] It worked out.
[00:10:49] Well, it's, it's a really important point because you have four kids.
[00:10:52] You're a busy dad and you have this business that you're now, you know, really the chief
[00:10:59] operator, you know, the CEO, the CEO, the CMO, you are the president.
[00:11:04] You are in charge of every part of the business.
[00:11:06] And you figured out by reverse engineering, hey, here, I need my nights and weekends because
[00:11:12] I have four kids and I want to be present for some of their stuff and their events and
[00:11:16] I just want to be around.
[00:11:18] So I better figure out a way to close business outside of that.
[00:11:23] And I love the fact that you reverse engineer that that is such a really smart.
[00:11:27] I was having this conversation this morning with another agent who was telling me that
[00:11:32] every year he does a sort of reverse engineer is what he wants to earn that year.
[00:11:37] And he does a pretty similar exercise to you.
[00:11:41] He goes, I want to make X amount and then he breaks it down by month and then by week.
[00:11:45] And then he figures out all those activities that will ultimately get him here.
[00:11:48] It's such, it sounds so simple, but it really is a nice sort of road map to get to where
[00:11:54] you want.
[00:11:54] And you really hacked your way through it in a really smart way because you did want to
[00:12:00] protect some of those, some of those time boundaries.
[00:12:04] And when you work with investors, they don't care.
[00:12:06] They just want to see the deal, right?
[00:12:08] So you're going out, you're finding opportunities.
[00:12:10] They don't need to physically see the property.
[00:12:12] You're going to do that for them.
[00:12:13] You're going to be their eyes and ears and you're going to be the deal finder.
[00:12:17] And I'm curious for, there's a lot of our listeners who have never worked with investors.
[00:12:24] What are some of the pros and the cons of working with investor buyers?
[00:12:30] Yeah, so again, just to reiterate, I mean, that scheduled component is important.
[00:12:34] It was for me.
[00:12:35] But I think for me, if you find the right investor and they have that capital that they can invest,
[00:12:43] I mean, I think one year I close seven deals with the same investor.
[00:12:47] So I mean, you have that constant deal flow, whereas as long as I was doing my due diligence
[00:12:51] and finding properties that cash flowed, and I knew what that looked like just because I've
[00:12:56] invested and I know what, especially single family homes, like that was kind of my realm
[00:13:01] and what I knew best.
[00:13:02] So for me, all I got to do was log in the MLS every day, figure out a property, run the numbers,
[00:13:09] send it to them, get his thoughts, go schedule the showing, write up an offer, and then we're
[00:13:13] often negotiations. So I mean, just having that built in deal flow, if you find the right investor,
[00:13:18] it was funny. And we could kind of go into this too.
[00:13:20] Like one great lead source of no one talks about is Ferent by owners.
[00:13:24] And that's how I got connected with that gentleman.
[00:13:26] And it was actually interesting.
[00:13:28] In my first year, I made a phone call to a Ferent by owner.
[00:13:34] It was just a simple script.
[00:13:36] You know, I see your properties listed for rent, but with the market being the way that it is,
[00:13:40] if you're considered selling a property, that led to a deal there.
[00:13:44] And then wow, sold another one with me.
[00:13:46] It sold another one with me the following year.
[00:13:48] He was just kind of liquidating his portfolio slowly, trying to avoid that
[00:13:52] huge head of capital gains tax at once.
[00:13:54] But it was just the end result of the story was super interesting about
[00:13:58] the right around Christmas time he called me and he's like,
[00:14:00] Mark, I just got a quick question for you.
[00:14:02] I'm updating my trust.
[00:14:05] You know, I just want to confirm with you, are you okay if I add your name and contact
[00:14:09] information for my family, just in case something happens to me?
[00:14:12] Wow.
[00:14:13] To me, building that relationship, even with just making that phone call, obviously,
[00:14:18] S.O.I. is number one in everyone's business.
[00:14:20] It should be.
[00:14:21] But if you can convert some of these lead sources like a
[00:14:24] FerentBioNor, ForSaleBioNor, and then add them to your S.O.I.
[00:14:27] and stay in touch and get referrals.
[00:14:30] And then that kind of blew my mind that he was that comfortable.
[00:14:33] It's me trusting me that much that he was going to put me in his trust.
[00:14:36] I mean, that was one of the greatest compliments that I think
[00:14:39] Oliver did in this business.
[00:14:41] So yeah, to my estimation, it doesn't get much,
[00:14:45] the compliment doesn't get much higher than that.
[00:14:47] So congratulations there.
[00:14:49] And you're absolutely right.
[00:14:51] I think that this idea of working with investors
[00:14:55] also to eliminate a lot of the emotional challenges
[00:14:59] that traditional buyers and sellers face, because of course,
[00:15:03] their primary residence, it's an emotional decision.
[00:15:05] It's a big financial decision.
[00:15:07] It's where they're going to live, where they're going to raise a family
[00:15:09] possibly.
[00:15:10] And of course, there's just a lot of emotion we know that is associated with that
[00:15:14] and a lot of stress.
[00:15:15] So when you're working with investors,
[00:15:18] that tends to be less of that, right?
[00:15:20] It's more about making the numbers make sense and just showing them a good deal.
[00:15:25] I am curious.
[00:15:27] So one of the myths that we like to dispel on the show,
[00:15:30] and I don't get to talk to too many agents that work with investors on,
[00:15:34] I'm fortunate to have you on the show,
[00:15:35] is I wanted to tell them that the investors are hard to find.
[00:15:40] So I know a lot of our listeners have written in going,
[00:15:43] hey, I'd love to work with investors.
[00:15:45] But how do I find investors?
[00:15:47] And my answer is, it's actually easy to find the investors,
[00:15:50] what's hardest to find the deals.
[00:15:52] Curious to get your thoughts on, does the money show up when you find a deal?
[00:15:57] Yeah, you're 100% right.
[00:15:59] Yeah, the investor is easy to find.
[00:16:01] The money, if you find the deal is easy to find,
[00:16:04] it's the deal that's impossible.
[00:16:05] Not impossible, I shouldn't say possible, sorry.
[00:16:07] Forgive me for that one.
[00:16:08] Difficult.
[00:16:10] Yeah, I mean, you could simply put a, go into bigger packets and post a few times
[00:16:14] on a thread in your neighborhood, in your community, in your area.
[00:16:18] I did that and I got, you know, people raising their hand,
[00:16:21] we're looking to work for me or work with me.
[00:16:24] Calling for them by owners was, I mean,
[00:16:26] that's how I got connected with the gentleman that was buying all those properties.
[00:16:30] He had said a property listed for rent.
[00:16:32] Kind of walked through the same thing.
[00:16:34] It was, you know, mid 2020, I'm like, you know, a lot of people are looking to
[00:16:37] liquidate their assets and sell everything off at a premium.
[00:16:41] And I see that you're buying.
[00:16:41] I kept noticing his name everywhere.
[00:16:44] And I said, you know, I noticed you're buying a bunch of properties,
[00:16:46] like what's the mindset?
[00:16:47] It's just having the conversation.
[00:16:50] Yeah, just having conversation.
[00:16:52] Just two things.
[00:16:53] You said congrats about doing the things that I'm doing.
[00:16:58] R&D, rip off and duplicate.
[00:17:00] That's all I'm doing.
[00:17:01] None of these, I'm not an intelligent guy.
[00:17:05] I hear these ideas.
[00:17:07] I take them, I run with them, I implement them.
[00:17:09] Like that coupled with go talk to people,
[00:17:13] have conversations with people, you're going to be successful.
[00:17:16] You just got to put in the work and it's so simple.
[00:17:21] It's not easy, but it's so simple.
[00:17:23] You just got to be willing to put the work in.
[00:17:25] Yeah, simple but hard, right?
[00:17:26] So I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:17:28] And I want to go back to the Ferrent Bioneer situation,
[00:17:30] because this is such a missed opportunity for most agents, right?
[00:17:35] So what is Mark really doing?
[00:17:37] So let's just give an example.
[00:17:39] So Mark's, let's walk in through a neighborhood.
[00:17:41] He sees a Ferrent sign in the window of somebody's house.
[00:17:44] And it's got Ferrent call this number.
[00:17:47] You know, Mark might call that number and say,
[00:17:48] hey, are you the owner or are you the tenant
[00:17:51] or the management company or whatever?
[00:17:52] Mark eventually gets his way to the owner and says,
[00:17:55] hey, by the way, you know,
[00:17:56] yeah, I may have a renter for you at some point.
[00:17:58] But also have you thought about selling, right?
[00:18:01] This is a great way to have a conversation with somebody
[00:18:04] that might not know that they're ready to sell
[00:18:08] or may just be good timing or a great way
[00:18:10] to start the relationship so that when they are ready,
[00:18:13] obviously, you know, you would be the person that they select.
[00:18:16] And Mark, I will tell you, I've been in this industry 14 years
[00:18:20] and I've heard about, you know, calling for Ferrent Bioneers
[00:18:24] for since I started.
[00:18:25] And I would say maybe 1% of agents do that.
[00:18:28] And I think it is one of the biggest missed opportunities
[00:18:31] because you're right.
[00:18:32] Eventually, you hit a vein of investors.
[00:18:34] And they're like, oh, this is what we do all the time.
[00:18:37] And maybe they're not happy with whoever they're using.
[00:18:40] And you can obviously work your way in.
[00:18:43] And obviously, you did.
[00:18:44] So I love that.
[00:18:46] And so how was investor?
[00:18:48] She said 60, what percentage of your deals
[00:18:51] in the first year approximately were investor deals?
[00:18:55] Yeah, let's say, like I said, I was at least 60, 40
[00:18:59] in my first year listing side versus buyer side.
[00:19:02] And then another, probably three quarters of those deals
[00:19:05] were working with investors.
[00:19:07] I don't do it.
[00:19:08] I'll be honest, I don't work with them as much anymore.
[00:19:13] It's just I've kind of transitioned
[00:19:14] to focusing more on the listing side.
[00:19:17] So I've kind of incorporated probate leads into everything.
[00:19:22] Let's talk about probate leads.
[00:19:24] Explain to our audience what those are
[00:19:27] and how you sort of got access to those.
[00:19:31] Yeah, so I mean, just going back to the rip off and duplicate thing.
[00:19:33] So I was on another podcast and I got connected with a gentleman,
[00:19:40] Chad Corbett, who runs, it's a course on probate
[00:19:45] and kind of walking you through that process,
[00:19:47] what it looks like, how to find business.
[00:19:50] So basically, create a website called NorthWest Indiana,
[00:19:53] statesolutions.com, the idea of being reaching out directly to,
[00:19:58] we can have access to through the court system,
[00:20:01] people that file probate in our county.
[00:20:04] So just giving them a call, walking through,
[00:20:07] hey, this is Mark.
[00:20:09] I'm a member of a local community group here in NorthWest
[00:20:12] in Indiana. We actually help families going through the probate process.
[00:20:14] So every month, we send a member of our team down to the county court house.
[00:20:17] They meet with the clerk and they actually provide us with a list of families.
[00:20:20] They think we might be able to help.
[00:20:22] So that's why I'm reaching out to you.
[00:20:23] You know, is there anything we can do to help you through?
[00:20:25] I know this is a particularly,
[00:20:26] is there anything in particular that you think might be able to help with?
[00:20:29] I know this is a difficult and stressful time
[00:20:30] in our goals is just try to alleviate as much of that as possible.
[00:20:34] And so just having that, yeah.
[00:20:37] So in probate is when
[00:20:40] wills and trusts maybe haven't been correctly established prior to death.
[00:20:46] Is that my understanding?
[00:20:47] Yes, sorry, I'm jumping into the framework.
[00:20:49] No, no, I just assume everyone's as dumb as me.
[00:20:53] And that's all I know about probate.
[00:20:55] So everyone else probably like, yeah, we know what probate is.
[00:20:57] But probate is when somebody passes away and there isn't sort of a obvious sort of
[00:21:03] and specific legal bait to distribute assets and they have to now go through the court systems.
[00:21:08] Is that accurate?
[00:21:09] That is accurate.
[00:21:10] Yes.
[00:21:11] So like I said, running through that script,
[00:21:14] calling through the list of probates and then trying to create
[00:21:18] relationship with local attorneys,
[00:21:21] just having that conversation of, you know, these are the benefits that we're offering to people.
[00:21:25] And we know they're in a difficult place.
[00:21:28] And they're lives right now, a lot of the personal representatives who are appointed either
[00:21:32] by the court or just the family is dictated that they take over and kind of run the probate process
[00:21:40] on their behalf.
[00:21:41] You know, the attorney has their, just like we have to work within the framework of what we do
[00:21:46] as real estate agents, they have to work within the framework of what they do as attorneys.
[00:21:49] So like a part of that
[00:21:55] business or the phone calls that I'm having with attorneys is just, hey, you know,
[00:21:59] what can I do to take something off of your plate to make your life easier?
[00:22:01] I know you don't want to deal with the real estate stuff.
[00:22:03] I have a list of contractor referrals.
[00:22:06] So if that comes up where someone within that estate, usually the biggest asset is real estate.
[00:22:14] So if someone within that estate needs to sell a piece of property and it might need work,
[00:22:18] hey, we have a list of contractors that we can team up with you.
[00:22:21] If you need anything at all, just call us and let us know.
[00:22:24] So just having those conversations with the PR and with the attorneys and
[00:22:29] yeah, I mean, just approaching it with empathy, right?
[00:22:31] Like they're going through a difficult situation.
[00:22:33] The more than likely they'd never gone through it before.
[00:22:37] So I think if you just have that conversation in a gentle way, like we're here for you,
[00:22:41] if you need anything at all, just reach out and then just this best week, I had an attorney
[00:22:45] reach out and probably have a referral for a listing and a market nearby.
[00:22:51] So I love that. I think just my personality and I want to help people and that's what we
[00:22:58] all should be striving to do. So it lends herself to being in that position.
[00:23:03] So I get a lot of satisfaction out of helping the people that needed them also.
[00:23:08] We've done almost 600 episodes of this show and nobody has ever mentioned probate leads.
[00:23:13] And what I realized with what you just were telling our audience is that calling probate
[00:23:20] attorneys might be a really good idea to develop relationships with because they, of course,
[00:23:25] have to do deal with assets and of course home usually being, if not the biggest, one of the
[00:23:30] biggest assets. And a lot of times, of course, offspring aren't living where mom and dad live.
[00:23:34] So it's this idea of we got to get rid of this property or we have to sell it or we want to sell
[00:23:39] it. But we need mom and dad lived in it for 40 years. So we have some work we need to do to it.
[00:23:44] And marks like, hey, I'm your solution. I can do all of that. And I think that is a brilliant
[00:23:50] strategy because we've had lots of people talking about divorce attorneys, a state planning
[00:23:57] attorneys, people that do have their rules and trusts in place before they pass away.
[00:24:01] Of course, those are great financial planners, account, you know, our asset. But no one has
[00:24:07] talked about probate attorneys. So love that idea. So R&D, rip and duplicate from Mark. Mark,
[00:24:15] I want to let's shift gears. I want to talk about move to highland.com because I think this is
[00:24:21] an amazing idea. So tell our audience what this is and why you built it. Yeah. So the owner of our
[00:24:28] brokerage, like I said, we're in Valparado in Indiana. He started the idea and from my understanding,
[00:24:38] at least as far as I know. So move to Valpo is a website. Again, rip off and duplicate. We took
[00:24:43] that and we just used that for highland. So through agent fire is a platform that I think it's
[00:24:49] pushed behind Tom Ferries program. Yeah. We created this website. It's called move to highland.com.
[00:24:57] Basically, like we view it as a community group trying to be a resource for people in the community to
[00:25:03] go to our website, understand things that are going on the community, but also drop people to the
[00:25:08] community that are thinking about making a move. So trying to get that SEO pushed up to the top. So when
[00:25:13] people are simply searching on Google, moving the highland in the end, we're trying to be at that
[00:25:19] top spot. But just giving them a resource for, you know, the specific neighborhoods in our market,
[00:25:25] things going on in the community. We have an IDX setup so that they can do their home search through
[00:25:31] through move to highland. And we as well, Jake and I, the other agent of all, to actually told me
[00:25:37] about your podcast. So shout out to Jacob, sure he's listening right now. But we created a community
[00:25:44] group within Facebook kind of doing the same thing. But we've seen success in just simple things like
[00:25:52] actually bought a rental property in April of 23. And we closed on the property. And the gentleman
[00:26:00] that was selling it, I was having a conversation with him in the kitchen of the property and started
[00:26:04] talking about his son and his, his just demon, right? His son's a stud football player at the at highland
[00:26:11] linebacker getting recruited by colleges like Stanford. So we just kind of took that around with it.
[00:26:17] I wrote a blog about it on our website. I published it on Facebook and I mean, we said people
[00:26:23] reaching out left and right. So I think just if you're looking for content creation and
[00:26:28] actually we're doing what we're doing, like pushing narratives of people in the town just to help
[00:26:32] again, like reinforce that community that I think every, every town in America probably lacks
[00:26:37] just leave with, you know, just where we are in the, in the current times that we live in.
[00:26:43] Yeah, everyone, I always kind of look back at the 50s. Like that was the golden era, right? Like,
[00:26:48] that just seemed like people everyone loved each other. I mean, I wasn't even born yet. So it's like a
[00:26:53] probably a not a pretty skewed vision of what reality. But yeah, I mean, I think we could all take a look
[00:26:59] back at that and like go back to a time where there was, we were heavily involved with Kenia. I think
[00:27:04] people would be a lot happier. So I agree. I think that's that's part of it is just trying to push
[00:27:09] and promote that agenda. And we should also mention too. So Highland is in Northwest Indiana. So
[00:27:15] it's it's closest big city is really Chicago. And Mark is is no, it was not unintentional. So Mark
[00:27:23] started look, you know, I live in the city of Chicago. And I would love to say that we're doing
[00:27:28] everything right here and people are flooding, you know, moving to Chicago. But sadly, that is not
[00:27:35] happening as much people are actually leaving Illinois due to, you know, a whole bunch of factors
[00:27:40] which I get very political and everyone has an opinion about. But the reality of it is people
[00:27:44] are moving. And they're moving to places like Northwest Indiana. It is not uncommon. Mark is not
[00:27:50] blind to that. He's not oblivious to that. And it's an amazing opportunity. Mark mentioned to
[00:27:56] finding that market was not accidental for you, you know, to tell us about how why you decided to
[00:28:02] really, in this case, you know, you did it with Alprezo. And now you're doing it with Highland. But
[00:28:06] Highland has, you know, this isn't just a random suburb that or a random city that you chose, right?
[00:28:14] No, you're here in San Crack. So I mean, in your right, 2021 and or 2020, 2021, I think Illinois was
[00:28:19] the number one state people were leaving during those two years. And Indiana was the number one
[00:28:23] state they were going to. So we're just over the border. We're considered a metro market,
[00:28:27] a submarket of Metro Chicago. We're about 45 minute drive away. And that's insulated us from
[00:28:35] a lot of these big swings just because especially Highland in particular, we're the second town
[00:28:40] over the border. So the people that want to avoid living in Illinois for, again, we won't get
[00:28:45] into the reasons. We won't need to travel into that. But yeah, we're a perfect spot to be in. So
[00:28:51] being close proximity to 1894, which is the inner state right there that gets you the Chicago's
[00:28:56] quickest possible. And then it was in 2022, I believe, Reader.com did a survey and they were
[00:29:05] tracking all these metrics of the most affordable markets in the United States. And they ran
[00:29:11] metrics like, you know, how quickly homes were under contract when listed, you know, what that price
[00:29:18] that's listed sale ratio was for each market. And out of the top 100 markets, we were number six
[00:29:28] in the country. Yeah, the, I mean, everyone's kind of struggling with inventory in their market.
[00:29:36] And that's been a huge driver in prices and availability and kind of the market we're seeing now.
[00:29:41] But we feel that probably more than most. So I mean, there's 14 active listings in
[00:29:48] Highland right now, which is just incredibly low. So I mean, as soon as homes are listed,
[00:29:54] they're selling. So we have that built in desirability of being in that close proximity to a major
[00:30:00] metro city like Chicago. So yeah, I mean, that was, it helps that Jake and I both live in Highland.
[00:30:07] We grew up here. We know the market well, but yeah, I don't think we'd be pushing as hard on all
[00:30:12] this and going the route that we're going had those things not been in place. So yeah, that definitely
[00:30:19] played an important factor. It's a really good, good point to everyone listening to know where the
[00:30:26] closest areas outside of your local market that people sort of move to. Obviously, you know, people
[00:30:33] make big moves down. Well, in our case, would be like down to Florida or Texas or Arizona from
[00:30:39] Illinois, you know, retirement. A lot of times people do that. And, but we're seeing this migration
[00:30:45] from Chicago to North West Indiana for taxes and, you know, political, you know, reasons and just,
[00:30:51] you know, things they don't like about Illinois. But every community has some version of that,
[00:30:56] right? And there's like this other place where people can go to. And so Marx, it's really smart,
[00:31:02] because Marx can then develop relationships. So even if people in Northwest Indiana,
[00:31:06] eventually they're going to possibly leave and go elsewhere, you know, maybe going down south.
[00:31:11] And so Marx is going to build this. He's built a network of agents that he can refer to as his
[00:31:16] clientele age and decide, you know, to move. And, you know, so he's, you're building relationships
[00:31:22] all over the place with, you know, with attorneys, you're building relationships with other agents.
[00:31:27] And you're also looking to see where people are moving towards. And it just happens to be where
[00:31:32] you grew up, which, which of course is a huge, a huge benefit. I wanted to ask about for sale by
[00:31:39] owners, because and expires and canceled, right? So, so these are the, these are the leads that are
[00:31:45] very easy to purchase, right? There's lots of companies that will sell you this information
[00:31:50] for very little money, really. It's a very inexpensive lead source. But it's an expensive
[00:31:56] reason, because it's actually quite difficult. And so as a result, a lot of people don't have
[00:32:01] success with those calls. They don't like making them or they, they, they're tough. But you have
[00:32:06] had a lot of success with those. So can you tell us a little bit about, you know, let's, let's say
[00:32:10] you called and expired. So just to set the scene, this is somebody who worked with it with an agent.
[00:32:16] It didn't go well. It didn't close or it didn't get sold. And now the listing is expired.
[00:32:23] You know, how did those calls go for you? Yeah. Yeah. That's a good question. And
[00:32:29] yeah, just going back to your point super quick. Super cheap lead sources, right? Again,
[00:32:35] a big part of my business is like, I could go, you know, that Zillow, no knock on it on anyone
[00:32:41] that's pursuing that. But again, I didn't fit my framework of, I didn't want to work with buyers.
[00:32:46] And profitability for me is number one, like for sale by owners are free. I can just go on zill
[00:32:52] and pull that information their phone over and then yeah, expires. I mean, I just
[00:32:56] 15 bucks a month and I have a white pages online subscription. I get their phone number and
[00:33:03] make the call. Just pull it every day and make the call. And I just closed one on Friday and
[00:33:08] just went on under contract on one last week. So yeah, we could walk through it. You're put me on
[00:33:12] the spot. I don't have my notes in front of me. I don't, but I shouldn't need them. But we can,
[00:33:17] well, no, no, I guess what I'm saying is they're, they can be difficult phone calls because these are
[00:33:21] either whether it's an expired or canceled or a sale by owner. These are all people that are either
[00:33:27] choosing actively not to work with a REALTOR or who I've worked with a REALTOR and didn't get
[00:33:32] the result they desired. So these can be tricky because you can get people who are not receptive
[00:33:38] to an agent's phone call and you're not the only person that is buying those leads as well.
[00:33:44] Other agents, of course, are buying them and are also calling. So the challenge sometimes is,
[00:33:48] you know, yeah, you might you might have the best pitch in the world, but you're the seventh guy,
[00:33:52] the call that person that day and they might just be like, oh, stop calling. And you're like,
[00:33:56] I just called for the first time. So how, how, how, though they're tricky, I guess the point is
[00:34:02] they're tricky, but they're working for you. So do you find there's a lot of competition with
[00:34:06] those calls? Are there agents making those dials alongside you, you know, from other firms?
[00:34:12] Yeah, absolutely. And just to challenge you on the, they're tricky. They're difficult conversations,
[00:34:17] but they're not that bad. They're not as bad as everyone says they are. If you have the correct
[00:34:22] framework and we can walk through it, if you want to run through the for sale by ownership,
[00:34:26] let's do it. I can explain. I would love to. All right, don't give me an objection. Give me even my,
[00:34:33] you know, my cousins and agent. Okay. And I can kind of, you know, I might not be perfect on this
[00:34:40] because sure we'll see, but yeah. All right. So I'll ring and then you answer the phone.
[00:34:45] Got it. Really? Hey, this is Mark. Plus, I'm a local REALTOR here in Northwest
[00:34:51] in, you know, I was calling about the property for sale over on Main Street. Okay. Yeah.
[00:34:59] Yeah, like I said, I see their sell them by owner. I completely respect that. You know,
[00:35:03] I was just curious if 30 days were to go by and the home doesn't sell for some reason,
[00:35:07] at that point in time, would you be open interviewing listening agents?
[00:35:10] Well, maybe, but I already have someone in my family that would do it for me.
[00:35:16] Yeah, no, I completely understand and listen, I hope my family and friends would say the
[00:35:19] exact same thing and show me that loyalty. So, you know, I can definitely appreciate that.
[00:35:23] You know, I'm just looking at the pictures on the listing on Zillow. It looks like a beautiful home.
[00:35:27] You know, I'm just curious. Why are you even considering moving in the first place?
[00:35:30] Oh, we're retiring and moving to another, another part of the country.
[00:35:36] Okay. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Hopefully, some were warmer than than where we're at right now,
[00:35:40] right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Well, listen, I understand you have another agent,
[00:35:45] agent in mind, and you're probably going to go that route. But would it be helpful if I,
[00:35:49] if I shout over my resume and that way, you could just have it on file, you know, just in the case
[00:35:54] that you decide to go another route or get a second opinion, would you be opposed to that?
[00:35:58] No, we have feel free to send it over. Okay, great. Well, yeah, I'll get your email address and then
[00:36:04] I'll send that information over. You know, what I can do, you know, I'm always in the area,
[00:36:09] would you be opposed to me popping by one day this week, just so I can take a look at the
[00:36:13] property, kind of get an understanding of a little bit more understanding your situation. And,
[00:36:17] you know, maybe that can cross reference my buyer list that I have and see if there's someone that
[00:36:22] I think might be a good fit. Is that something you'd be opposed to if I just pop by quick one day
[00:36:26] this week? Sure, I guess that's okay. Okay. Yeah. And like I said, what I can do when I'm there is
[00:36:32] I'll bring my FSBO backup plan. I can walk you through that process,
[00:36:36] feel free to steal any of my tips and tricks. We have, you know, built in marketing system and
[00:36:43] a pricing strategy that we use to sell all of our listings quicker than the market average.
[00:36:49] Like I said, feel free to take steal any of that information you want, but at least this way,
[00:36:54] you're your arm going forward. And can I ask you one more thing really quick? Sure.
[00:36:59] Yeah, would you be opposed to, you know, me checking in with you after that meeting every
[00:37:03] every few days and what I'll do is I'll send you tips. I can walk you through what that purchase
[00:37:08] agreement looks like, you know, negotiable terms. And like I said, you know, after our meeting and
[00:37:15] I understand that you have another agent that you might work with, but maybe after our meeting,
[00:37:19] you know, we have a conversation and see if it makes sense to work together in the future.
[00:37:22] Is that fair? Absolutely fair. Okay. Well, great. Well, and then yeah, just set the appointments in
[00:37:28] yeah, no, that was that was brilliant because what Mark did and from my interpretation, Mark,
[00:37:34] please correct me if I miss, miss judge that, but Mark led with value. He, number one, he didn't try
[00:37:42] to overcome an objection, right? If somebody's cousin is the REALTOR, you're not going to say, well,
[00:37:47] I'm sure I'm better in your cousin. He's not going to say that. Or do you like your cousin or
[00:37:52] whatever, but the reality of it is he's got that, that hill to climb. And what he did is said,
[00:37:58] hey, I get it. Yeah, I would work with my cousin too. I hope my cousin would work with me. And
[00:38:02] I'd also like to give you a second opinion. And I have some ideas. Can I swing by and just kind of
[00:38:07] take a quick look, get a better sense of the property. Even if you don't use me, you can still take
[00:38:13] some of the ideas I might be able to help you sell the home a little faster. Maybe we'll work together
[00:38:17] in the future, maybe not even on this transaction, but I'm going to, and then I'm going to follow up with
[00:38:22] you like what he said was brilliant because it made it very difficult for me to say no, because
[00:38:27] it was like he was giving me things. He was just saying, hey, can I give this to you? Can I give this
[00:38:31] to you? Can I give this to you? All things to help me with my stated objective, which is get the
[00:38:36] home sold. Right. So whether or not, and I'm going to always as a consumer, I'm going to always
[00:38:42] choose anyone in my life as a service provider who provides the most value. I'm just always going
[00:38:47] to do that. I mean, yes, if my sister was a REALTOR, I'd always go with my sister outside of that
[00:38:51] situation. She's not a REALTOR, but inside of that outside of that situation, I'm going with whoever
[00:38:56] provides value. So is that my understanding? You're leading with like education and value?
[00:39:00] Yeah, I'm not trying to handle objections. It was the big thing you said, I'm not going to,
[00:39:04] I'm not going to convince someone to list their home with me over the phone nine times out of 10,
[00:39:09] but what I need to do is get in front of them in person, set that appointment, so that you can
[00:39:13] kind of build on that. And you're, you're almost qualifying that appointment, just like you would with
[00:39:19] a buyer. So you start trying to get that email address. And depending on you can even take it
[00:39:25] as far as like DJ, when I said, you know, I'm calling about the home for sale on main street.
[00:39:30] If DJ are like, yeah, yeah, what do you need? How can I help you if they're like bubbly and I feel
[00:39:34] that in the personality, I'll even change my script and say, yeah, no, I'm sure you've been,
[00:39:39] I'm sure you've been having phone calls from every age in the late county all morning long. So,
[00:39:42] you know, I apologize on behalf of all of us, but that's a great thing to say. I love that by the way.
[00:39:47] I say, I've, I've used a version of that when I recruit REALTORS. So I recruit REALTORS for our
[00:39:52] firm. And what happens is when somebody passes their real estate exam in Illinois, the testing center
[00:39:57] sells that information to every brokerage in town. So it's very similar to sale by owner leads. So
[00:40:02] all of a sudden, all these brokerages who are looking to hire REALTORS, we all get the same list
[00:40:06] at the same time. And so I say, hey, you're probably very popular right now. You're probably getting
[00:40:11] a lot of calls, probably more than you want. I apologize for that. And, you know, and then you just kind
[00:40:16] of go from there, see your acknowledging their reality, which is great because there's a lot of
[00:40:20] agents that just want to steamroll over try to get the sale and you're sort of acknowledging the
[00:40:25] current situation and still trying to add value. Yeah, no, you're right. And it's same thing, like,
[00:40:30] you have that, you have that natural built-in sales reactants, right? As soon as you're phone rings,
[00:40:34] and I say, I'm a REALTOR, you're like, you're in that fight or fight mode. You're like, you're
[00:40:39] hanging up. You're gonna yell at me. But if you, if you can nip that in the bud right away, and it's
[00:40:44] the analogy that I always heard that I love, like, imagine walking on a, the second you step foot
[00:40:49] on a car lot, you're gonna approach by a used car salesman, which, okay, and your natural resistance
[00:40:55] is like, they're saying, you know, can I help you with anything? And your natural thing to say is,
[00:40:59] no, well, then 10 minutes later, you find the car you want, then now you need to go approach that
[00:41:02] person to get the keys, right? Like, it, it's just their mentality, which I get, and we're all wired
[00:41:08] that way. So if you can approach the conversation, like you said, leading with value, being nice is
[00:41:14] monumentally important. When you mentioned me having going up against other agents on these phone calls,
[00:41:23] yeah, they're, you know, it's probably not as bad here as it is in Chicago, where you have 50,000
[00:41:27] agents and Cook County alone, probably, yeah, we do. 3,000. So we have 3,000. So I think there's about
[00:41:34] 10 on average, the call for sale by owners in my market. And, you know, I don't want to sound
[00:41:41] arrogant, but I'm told this by the sellers, you know, more often than not, they're choosing me. And
[00:41:46] it's simply because I approach the whole conversation differently than what, then how they are. And
[00:41:51] they're, they're trying to overcome objections over the phone, telling them their price too high,
[00:41:55] telling them they're never selling their own, they'll, you know, they'll net more money. Listen,
[00:42:00] I believe that, but I'm not going to, in the initial phone call, I'm not going to bring that up
[00:42:04] and walk them through that conversation. It just, it doesn't make sense. Um, so,
[00:42:09] here's why you failed, Mr. Seller. You're not, you're not going to do that. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:42:15] Here's what he did wrong. Um, and, and, and, you know, maybe there's a certain percentage of people
[00:42:20] that respond well to that, but it is a tiny percentage that responded well to, hey, I, I can help
[00:42:26] you. Here's what, here's all the things you did wrong. You know what they did wrong because
[00:42:29] obviously you're an agent and, you know, they priced it to high, almost 99% of the case. But what
[00:42:34] Mark's doing is saying, Hey, I need to come and take a look at this. And then he's, he's basically
[00:42:38] doing what consultants do. Let me come take a look, see what the situation is and I'll come back to you
[00:42:43] with some ideas and feel free to take them or not. I just want to try to earn your business going
[00:42:47] forward. So it's, it's a really brilliant strategy because again, it makes it very hard to say no to
[00:42:53] because Mark's not asking for anything. You're all, the only thing you were asking for is can I send,
[00:42:58] can I come by and is it okay if I follow up and send you some stuff like who would say, you know,
[00:43:04] if anyone says no to that, I guess you just move on and make another call, but it's a pretty hard
[00:43:09] thing to say no to. Yeah, and I'll find seven or eight out of ten or saying yes, and I'm not getting
[00:43:17] pushed back as long as I'm, yes, as long as they're giving me that opening in the beginning,
[00:43:22] I'm setting an appointment quite regularly. And even like, like you mentioned, they might not
[00:43:27] hire me in that particular instance, but there was 2021, was probably around the first time I was
[00:43:34] calling for sale by owners and I had a conversation with a lady named Julie who was a FSBO
[00:43:39] and a town a few, few towns over. I call Julie every week for five weeks. She gave me that opening.
[00:43:46] I never set the appointment, but you know, it was offering value like, hey, how, you know, I didn't
[00:43:51] trash her pictures too bad, but they were taken with the cell phone. I'm like, here's the, here's
[00:43:55] a contact info for the photographer we use to do professional photography and video walkthroughs
[00:43:59] that we use for every, every one of our listings. Just trying to give her tips and advice on how to
[00:44:04] sell the home on her own. She ended up selling on her own, okay? Shoot, I missed that on the sale.
[00:44:12] I it's early 2023. I'm sitting on my couch and I get a phone call late at night and it's Julie.
[00:44:18] She said, hey, I don't know if you remember me. We talked, you know, two years ago, but I saved you
[00:44:23] in my phone. My in-laws are getting ready to sell a property in the same town that she was in.
[00:44:29] That was a half a million dollar property. Sitting at the listing appointment, she pulls out her
[00:44:34] phone. She's like, do you remember I told you like, I saved you on my phone. She just saved me on
[00:44:38] her phone as a REALTOR nice guy. I don't even think, I think my name was Mark REALTOR nice guy.
[00:44:45] So I mean, just because you don't get to sale at first time, you're having conversations. You're
[00:44:49] talking to people and it leads to business. So yeah, if I could just say one thing, don't be
[00:44:54] scared to have, like just go out there, have conversations. It's never gonna be a bad thing.
[00:45:02] Yeah, and even if the person is rude or hangs up on you, oh well, it's not personal. It's just
[00:45:09] that you were the ninth person to call him if it's an expired and it happens and you know, you say,
[00:45:13] okay, well, maybe I'll try again, you know, in a few days or I'll just move on to the next call.
[00:45:17] But 70 to 80% of the time, they're like, yeah, come on by and send me some info. I mean,
[00:45:23] that's incredible, incredible results. So we've been hearing for years, Fisbeau's of Dad,
[00:45:29] expires are dead, canceled listings are dead, canceled yeah, cancel listings are dead.
[00:45:34] No, they're not. You just have to take a different approach. And why is Mark doing all of this?
[00:45:39] Because he wants to protect his nights and weekends, right? This is really, he wants to do listings.
[00:45:44] He's got four kids. He wants to be there. And he's not, you know, maybe you're doing an open house
[00:45:50] here and there. Obviously, that's great, great thing. But he wants listings. He doesn't want to drive
[00:45:55] buyers around at nights and weekends, makes sense. And so he just reversed sends to near it and figured
[00:46:00] out a way to make it work. And guys, this is such, I love talking to people like this because
[00:46:06] everyone, you know, so many agents get into this industry because they just want to do like
[00:46:11] what they see maybe on television, you know, these lug, these just luxury buyers or luxury sellers.
[00:46:17] And all of that's great. And obviously, there's agents for that as well. But there are so many
[00:46:22] other ways to build a repeatable and sustainable business. And often it's by doing the activities
[00:46:29] that other agents won't do. And so when you see that for Rentsign as Mark said at the beginning,
[00:46:34] you know, written and, you know, from a Home Depot for Rentsign with somebody's, you know,
[00:46:39] a handwritten phone number on it, that's probably a sign that it's a mom and pop who run that,
[00:46:44] who own that building. It's probably not a big management company or also maybe have a different
[00:46:49] type of sign or if you see it online on, you know, Craigslist or Zillow or apartments.com, you know,
[00:46:54] somebody clearly it's not an agent posting a rental. That's a great phone call for Mark because he's
[00:46:59] going to call and say, Hey, I'd love to chat with the owner. Is he the owner? And brilliant,
[00:47:04] brilliant stuff. And again, you know, you're having conversations about real estate. You're talking to
[00:47:09] people that have not even yet sometimes raised their hand, right? Now for expires, Fisbeau's,
[00:47:16] obviously, those are people that are obviously in the market at the time. But you're, I love the
[00:47:21] for sale or sorry, the for rent by owners is the is kind of the forgotten group in real estate
[00:47:27] for leads. So I, and you could also help them on the rental side if they're not ready to sell as
[00:47:32] well. And you could just start developing the relationship there. Say, how can help you find
[00:47:36] tenants for you? And, you know, do you have any other properties? Do you do other stuff? Are you
[00:47:41] an investor in other ways? What's your long-term strategy with this property? Do you want to sell it
[00:47:45] at some point? Well, let me, let's start talking about it. I can run some numbers for you. I mean,
[00:47:49] this is, these are ways in and Mark, I could not be more impressed with your ability to sort of
[00:47:56] do to do these. What do you sort of see going forward? Do you see anything trending that's
[00:48:04] changing your business at all? Like, you know, is there still a lot of opportunity for investment?
[00:48:09] Is the investor, you said you're not working with as many investors now because you want to switch
[00:48:13] over to listings. How is that transition going from investors to listings? Yeah, that's a great
[00:48:19] question. The market dictates, dictates so much of that in my opinion. And there's a little thing,
[00:48:23] you know, the commission lawsuit that's going on, that kind of plays in the system.
[00:48:27] It's kind of a big deal. Yeah. So, I mean, knowing the market, knowing we're going,
[00:48:33] if you work with investors right now, you know with the interest rates being the way they are,
[00:48:38] I mean, there's cash buyers out there, right? We usually those properties are pretty distressed.
[00:48:43] But if you're finding something on the market, we're kind of in this weird, this weird place,
[00:48:47] we're inventory is super low, but with the interest rates, you know, certain homes are overpriced,
[00:48:51] sit for a while. So yeah, I mean, if there's an investor out there that's going to need a loan,
[00:48:55] and you can negotiate a credit to buy it on that rate, that makes a lot of sense. But for me,
[00:49:00] I'm letting the market dictate my actions. So I'm going deeper in listings. So that's why the
[00:49:05] probate thing is I'm being very intentional about and trying to grow that as much as I am because
[00:49:13] unfortunately, the unfortunate reality is, I mean, the baby boomer generation is gigantic.
[00:49:16] Those people pass away and they typically have a home to sell. So just leading with that thought that
[00:49:24] there's inventory out there that's going to be hitting the market. And if I can create that
[00:49:30] relationship with an attorney and have the first, the first shot at getting those listings,
[00:49:35] I mean, that's got to be up there for people I think and it is obviously for me.
[00:49:41] I'm relying heavily. I mean, this is going in the year four for me. The whole intent of this
[00:49:45] business was to just be professional, be an advisor in the sense that I do such a good job.
[00:49:57] Or my goal is to do such a good job that I'm getting referrals and repeat business out of my
[00:50:01] clients. And that's what the business has evolved to. So doubling down on that, making sure I'm
[00:50:07] staying in front of my S O I with postcards, events, sending the clients the closed transactions
[00:50:14] really in their settlement statements so that they can be prepared for their taxes. Like little
[00:50:18] things like that to stay in front of my clients all the time, my past clients. And just asking for
[00:50:23] referrals, like not again, you brought it up with the FSBO and expired. Those are
[00:50:29] things that a lot of agents shy away from. They're the difficult things. But to me, that's where
[00:50:33] that's what the success success can be found. So yet doubling down on things like that,
[00:50:39] doing the difficult things that people don't want to do. The agents don't want to do.
[00:50:44] That's been monumentally important in my business. And I mean, asking for referrals, it's
[00:50:50] you can do all of these things in a way that makes you feel kind of cringy or you can find out a way
[00:50:56] where you're adding value to them. You're just asking for their help as simple as that sometimes.
[00:51:03] I walked you through this transaction. It went awesome. You left me a five-star Google review.
[00:51:08] It would be so helpful for my business and my family if you were to, if you hear about anyone,
[00:51:15] any friend or family looking to buy yourself, just share my name, like simple stuff like that.
[00:51:20] It's so easy, but people are scared to do it. You know, they shouldn't be because you just,
[00:51:26] I like that you use the word family because you do have a family and you are a father. And it is
[00:51:31] important because it is how you provide for your family. And so to be able to say to somebody,
[00:51:38] hey, I'm so glad you had a great experience with me. And then to add in, you know, if you ever hear
[00:51:43] anybody talking about real estate needs, I'd be honored if you'd consider passing that information
[00:51:48] over to me or passing my information over to them. It really does it only just help me, but it
[00:51:52] really helps support my family as well. I think that is a perfectly acceptable thing to say. And it's
[00:51:58] true. And I love the idea of saying this is, I mean, I love the honesty of that, I think is absolutely
[00:52:07] commendable and courageous to say, to use the word family because what's more important than
[00:52:12] family, right? Not much. So I couldn't agree. Boy, Mark, I could, I could pick your brain for all
[00:52:18] these little tricks and tips and not tricks. I mean, they're authentic strategies, but I could
[00:52:23] pick your brain for all these little tips for the next several hours. But I think this is actually
[00:52:27] a great place to wrap up because you have provided an incredible amount of value. We even did a
[00:52:32] role-playing session, which was actually really helpful for me. So I can better, maybe I will,
[00:52:37] well, I'm going to send this to all of we about 800 agents. So I'm going to send this to our 800
[00:52:40] agents going, Hey, here's somebody who is doing what you probably don't want to do because you think
[00:52:45] it's hard and difficult, especially Fisbeau's expires and canceled. But here's somebody and here's
[00:52:51] the exact way he does it and give it a shot and see what kind of response you get because you're
[00:52:56] right. Mark said this at the beginning. He said, it's all about your SOI, your sphere of influence.
[00:53:00] How do we continually add value so that people want to be in our sphere of influence? And,
[00:53:07] you know, first, how do we get to them and how do we give them value so that they stay in our orbit
[00:53:12] for as long as possible and hopefully, you know, not only do they become clients, but they tell
[00:53:17] other people, gosh, this guy, Mark, I've never even done a transaction with him, but he sends me all
[00:53:22] sorts of great information. He's a good guy. I feel like, you know, I should pass him in for
[00:53:26] past some clients over to him. So guys, I could not agree with Mark's strategy more effectively.
[00:53:33] I couldn't agree with it more. I think it's one of the most effective ways to grow one's business,
[00:53:37] lead with value. Love that. And Mark, one other thing I just wanted to say, Mark is somebody who
[00:53:44] pivots. So Mark said, Hey, my actions are dictated by the market. I love that because here's what Mark's
[00:53:50] not saying. Oh, it's so hard right now. Inventory's low. The interest rates are high. None of my clients
[00:53:56] really want to do anything. Mark's like, Okay, I'm going to figure out a different way to do it.
[00:53:59] I'm just going to pivot and go where where the action is. And I suspect if everything changes next
[00:54:04] year, you might pivot again and pivot to more opportunities because that's what successful agents do.
[00:54:11] They pivot. They find opportunities. They make adjustments and they roll with whatever the market
[00:54:16] conditions are because you don't have much control over that anyway. So I love the fact that you're
[00:54:21] taking back control by finding those opportunities and not just going, Well, I guess I have to wait
[00:54:26] till rates come down before my buyers get off the fence. So really, Mark, this was awesome. I
[00:54:32] congratulate you on, you know, three to four years in the business, crushing it 32 deals in your
[00:54:38] first year. That is not an accident. That is not a stroke of good luck. What I was hoping,
[00:54:43] I was a little worried when I first asked you because I thought, What if he says, Well, my wife's
[00:54:48] business has like a thousand age, a thousand people there. My wife's family's business. And all
[00:54:52] those people used to be, I was like, Oh, well, not everywhere. And Mark's like, No, that's not really
[00:54:57] where I got my business. I actually went out and saw on my so I love your country. Contrary
[00:55:05] to that is actually what happened. I was very vocal with the fact that I made that move and I did
[00:55:10] not want to work with buyers. And I did not want to that schedule was so bad. I've been working
[00:55:16] late and then going, I lost out quite a bit of business because of the things I was saying to
[00:55:21] family members. And so yeah, I mean, there was quite a few employees at that company that
[00:55:26] did not use me my first year. So actually funny. Bring that up. Yeah, it hurts.
[00:55:36] Thank Mark on behalf of our audience. Mark is a younger broker who is really
[00:55:42] country. He had a nice guy and I'm so glad that you you came on our show today. I want everyone
[00:55:49] to check to take a look, you know, we talk about specializing in especially in a geographic area.
[00:55:54] Mark has done this. He's built web properties to help people who are thinking about moving to those
[00:55:59] areas so that they can hopefully be the part of the agent they use. So move to Hyland.com. He has
[00:56:05] moved to Balpo as well. We'll put links to those in the show notes. But I wanted you to see what Mark
[00:56:10] and his team provide. And also if you are an agent in the Northwest Indiana area or if you're
[00:56:16] an actual agent in Indiana and Illinois and you work in the Northwest Indiana area and you're
[00:56:23] looking maybe to see if there's another company or team out there that would be a good fit.
[00:56:28] Mark and his team they are growing obviously and expanding and they would love the opportunity to
[00:56:33] see if you guys could work together. So Mark, if there are any agents that are looking to maybe see
[00:56:38] what other firms offer, what's the best way they should reach out? Yeah, they could just reach out
[00:56:43] directly to me or our brokerage and just check out brokerworks.com. Andrew Canese is the owner of
[00:56:49] the brokerage. Super smart guy didn't start here. I made the jump after meeting Andrew and
[00:56:55] yeah, I've taken a lot of the information I shared today from him. So super smart guy knows
[00:57:00] the business super well. I love it here. So yeah, and the other thing if you're an agent and you're
[00:57:06] in that Chicago market and you know your sellers leave in and coming over here. Feel free to give
[00:57:10] us a call. We'd love to work with you and get some referrals out of there too. So
[00:57:15] well as Mark said, there's there's 46,000 REALTORS in the Chicago and area. A lot of them listen
[00:57:20] to this show. So guys, if you are not familiar or licensed in Northwest Indiana, you're going to
[00:57:25] want to refer that. You want to refer it to somebody. Might as well be Mark. He's crushing it. He's
[00:57:30] killing it and we know he's his clients think that this is a nice guy and that's that's that's
[00:57:35] about as good of a compliment and he's been he's even in someone's trust. So that's pretty impressive.
[00:57:40] So Mark, thank you so much. I am so grateful for you to come on the show on behalf of the audience.

Today on the show, my guest is Mark Plesha with broker works in Highland, Indiana. That's Northwest Indiana, by the way. Let me tell you more about Mark. Now, after listening to countless episodes of bigger pockets, podcasts, which by the way, I've had the bigger pockets guys on our show as well, bigger pockets for those of you that aren't less that aren't familiar is the nation's largest online forum for real estate investors. So check out bigger pockets. But Mark is listening to countless episodes, bigger pockets. And after purchasing two rental properties, Mark decided to transition from his W2 job selling into selling real estate in the beginning of 2020 right in the middle of the start of the pandemic. He got licensed in July of that year. And in his first full year during the pandemic, Mark closed dramatic pause for effect 32 transactions for a little over 6 million in sales, 32 transactions in his first year while only working, and this is the even crazier part, only working 30 hours a week. His early successes were largely due to a focused direct outbound prospecting campaign and also being very diligent in protecting his time for income practice or producing activities. And in 2022, Mark closed over 8 million and was the top agent in his office. Mark was raised and currently resides in Highland, Indiana with his beautiful flight Liz and therefore children. I want everybody to visit Mark's website for broker works, which is move to Highland.com. And specifically, I want you to look at how Mark and his team are really targeting people who are looking to move to Highland. And they have a whole brand built around that. And we're going to talk about that. Say, Mark, welcome to the show. Yeah, thank you for the intro DJ. And like you said, listen, a lot of podcasts years, years was definitely one of them. And I think that's definitely playing the success. So thank you for everything that you do for the community. Yeah, I'm just hopefully I can give back, give back some tidbits and hopefully help some agents out. And congratulations to you. You have the best podcast voice of all time. So good to see you, sir. Well, that's debatable, but I'll take the compliment. Thank you. There you go. And I don't know that I'm the best host. Maybe I have the best voice, but I don't know if I have the best host. But I will do my best. We will do our best for our audience today. Thanks for being here. Yeah, so Mark has such a cool story because he's really doing things that I think a lot of agents aren't doing. And so we're certainly going to get to that. But Mark, let's talk about why the shift into real estate. So you've been licensed as 2020. What got you there? Yeah. And you know, off the top of the mind, you start thinking, you know, I have an interesting story. But then you start listing 100s and 100s of podcasts with agents interviewed. And everyone's got an interesting story, right? No one except for there's the occasional guest. One out of every 100 like, oh, yeah, my grandpa started RE/MAX. So I was born into it. Like that happens. But that's not the few of those. Yeah. There's a few of those. I've heard a few interesting stories, right? But like we're all an interesting breed. I feel like we got into this. This is usually second third career. And so it's always interesting to listen to other people's stories. It's mind's not anything crazy. You know, I was a union laborer prior to getting into real estate. I worked for a family business that my wife's father owned. Just super blessed to be able to be into that position and get hired there. And they gave me an opportunity that I probably didn't deserve. So, you know, I'm incredibly grateful for that opportunity. But quickly on, I kind of realized, you know, this wasn't for me. This isn't where I saw myself ending up and being happy for the next 20, 30 years until retirement. So I had a lot of conversations with my wife, which you can imagine. The little difficult conversations. Very, yeah, there's just some things that we knew would have to navigate. That might not be easy. But we ultimately came to the conclusion after, like I said, I had downtime at that job within certain aspects of it. And I delve deep into podcasts. So first ones, bigger pockets and then got into real estate investing a little bit. And, you know, I was just driving down the road one day and thinking to myself, you know, I kind of started to get that bug of being an entrepreneur. They pushed the book over to Port Ed, really hard in that podcast. So I read that book and, you know, I was just silly because for months, I'm like, what could I do? Like what business could I start going through all these conversations in my head? And finally, just driving down the road one day, I'm like, you idiot, like going to real estate full time, like get licensed and be a real estate agent. It's everything, all that information and knowledge I already acquired through all those podcasts, all that translates. So I say right around December 2019, I finally made the decision like, okay, we're all on board with this. You know, we were always pretty good sabers. We try to live off like 50% of our income. So we, I think that's super important to, for me, there's no going back. If I made the jump, I was, I was going full in and I was making that jump and I wasn't going back. Would they have me back? I'm sure. But in my mind, I'm like, I can't, just there's a pride thing there, right? Like I can't go back. So knowing that and knowing, yeah, just making that leap and that jump, you know, just the sink or sling. Yeah, I make it work. So you went from really working with your hands and being, you know, being, you know, your wife's family's business and switching over into, you know, you started studying about real estate investing via bigger pockets and other podcasts and a lot of agents, sorry, a lot of investors will get their real estate license even just to do their own transactions for their own investments because, of course, you save on the commission pretty, you know, just did your own investments. It would still make sense to get your license. But like, oh, by the way, now I can also help other people do all sorts of transactions as well. And you really did hit the ground running. I have, I don't know that I've ever met anyone who did 32 transactions in their first year. That is incredible. And I'm sure our audience is dying to know how did you do that? Yeah. And going back a little bit into the, the old career, right? Like, one of the big instances for me was I, two kids at the time, I was working 50, 60 hours a week, sometimes 70, 80. I never knew my schedule. You know, so that time with my family was important. And so going into, I think that was a hindrance for me of making that switch was, okay, how do I, if I do want to reduce my work hours, like, I got to go into this intentionally because the big thing holding me back was, you know, you, you think about real estate agents and your schedule, they're probably working nights and weekends. So working through that thought process and kind of working backwards of, okay, what do I want my career to look like? I want to have my time available to me. So just listening to a podcast, I'm going to always reference back to that because there's so many countless podcasts that got me to where I am and kind of reverse engineering the business of, okay, if I don't want to be doing showings and nights and weekends, how do I control my schedule as much as possible? Listings, right? So then working through that, what are my lead sources that I can, as a new agent, I can jump right into calling for sale banners, calling cancels, calling expires. Later on, I got into probate leads. And then the other facet of the business that you can kind of dictate your own schedule, which I already had somewhat of an intimate knowledge and was working with investors. So actually early on, I got connected with an investor who was out of state. I would go look at the properties for him on my own time. So again, I'm in control of my schedule. And that's kind of where you mentioned in my intro, working that 30 hour a week schedule, that's what allowed me to do that. I was probably 60, 40 listings in that first year. And I would say three quarters of the buyers that I had were working with investors. So I was home a lot with my kids, which yeah, it was a blessing. I mean, that's all I can say. It worked out. Well, it's, it's a really important point because you have four kids. You're a busy dad and you have this business that you're now, you know, really the chief operator, you know, the CEO, the CEO, the CMO, you are the president. You are in charge of every part of the business. And you figured out by reverse engineering, hey, here, I need my nights and weekends because I have four kids and I want to be present for some of their stuff and their events and I just want to be around. So I better figure out a way to close business outside of that. And I love the fact that you reverse engineer that that is such a really smart. I was having this conversation this morning with another agent who was telling me that every year he does a sort of reverse engineer is what he wants to earn that year. And he does a pretty similar exercise to you. He goes, I want to make X amount and then he breaks it down by month and then by week. And then he figures out all those activities that will ultimately get him here. It's such, it sounds so simple, but it really is a nice sort of road map to get to where you want. And you really hacked your way through it in a really smart way because you did want to protect some of those, some of those time boundaries. And when you work with investors, they don't care. They just want to see the deal, right? So you're going out, you're finding opportunities. They don't need to physically see the property. You're going to do that for them. You're going to be their eyes and ears and you're going to be the deal finder. And I'm curious for, there's a lot of our listeners who have never worked with investors. What are some of the pros and the cons of working with investor buyers? Yeah, so again, just to reiterate, I mean, that scheduled component is important. It was for me. But I think for me, if you find the right investor and they have that capital that they can invest, I mean, I think one year I close seven deals with the same investor. So I mean, you have that constant deal flow, whereas as long as I was doing my due diligence and finding properties that cash flowed, and I knew what that looked like just because I've invested and I know what, especially single family homes, like that was kind of my realm and what I knew best. So for me, all I got to do was log in the MLS every day, figure out a property, run the numbers, send it to them, get his thoughts, go schedule the showing, write up an offer, and then we're often negotiations. So I mean, just having that built in deal flow, if you find the right investor, it was funny. And we could kind of go into this too. Like one great lead source of no one talks about is Ferent by owners. And that's how I got connected with that gentleman. And it was actually interesting. In my first year, I made a phone call to a Ferent by owner. It was just a simple script. You know, I see your properties listed for rent, but with the market being the way that it is, if you're considered selling a property, that led to a deal there. And then wow, sold another one with me. It sold another one with me the following year. He was just kind of liquidating his portfolio slowly, trying to avoid that huge head of capital gains tax at once. But it was just the end result of the story was super interesting about the right around Christmas time he called me and he's like, Mark, I just got a quick question for you. I'm updating my trust. You know, I just want to confirm with you, are you okay if I add your name and contact information for my family, just in case something happens to me? Wow. To me, building that relationship, even with just making that phone call, obviously, S.O.I. is number one in everyone's business. It should be. But if you can convert some of these lead sources like a FerentBioNor, ForSaleBioNor, and then add them to your S.O.I. and stay in touch and get referrals. And then that kind of blew my mind that he was that comfortable. It's me trusting me that much that he was going to put me in his trust. I mean, that was one of the greatest compliments that I think Oliver did in this business. So yeah, to my estimation, it doesn't get much, the compliment doesn't get much higher than that. So congratulations there. And you're absolutely right. I think that this idea of working with investors also to eliminate a lot of the emotional challenges that traditional buyers and sellers face, because of course, their primary residence, it's an emotional decision. It's a big financial decision. It's where they're going to live, where they're going to raise a family possibly. And of course, there's just a lot of emotion we know that is associated with that and a lot of stress. So when you're working with investors, that tends to be less of that, right? It's more about making the numbers make sense and just showing them a good deal. I am curious. So one of the myths that we like to dispel on the show, and I don't get to talk to too many agents that work with investors on, I'm fortunate to have you on the show, is I wanted to tell them that the investors are hard to find. So I know a lot of our listeners have written in going, hey, I'd love to work with investors. But how do I find investors? And my answer is, it's actually easy to find the investors, what's hardest to find the deals. Curious to get your thoughts on, does the money show up when you find a deal? Yeah, you're 100% right. Yeah, the investor is easy to find. The money, if you find the deal is easy to find, it's the deal that's impossible. Not impossible, I shouldn't say possible, sorry. Forgive me for that one. Difficult. Yeah, I mean, you could simply put a, go into bigger packets and post a few times on a thread in your neighborhood, in your community, in your area. I did that and I got, you know, people raising their hand, we're looking to work for me or work with me. Calling for them by owners was, I mean, that's how I got connected with the gentleman that was buying all those properties. He had said a property listed for rent. Kind of walked through the same thing. It was, you know, mid 2020, I'm like, you know, a lot of people are looking to liquidate their assets and sell everything off at a premium. And I see that you're buying. I kept noticing his name everywhere. And I said, you know, I noticed you're buying a bunch of properties, like what's the mindset? It's just having the conversation. Yeah, just having conversation. Just two things. You said congrats about doing the things that I'm doing. R&D, rip off and duplicate. That's all I'm doing. None of these, I'm not an intelligent guy. I hear these ideas. I take them, I run with them, I implement them. Like that coupled with go talk to people, have conversations with people, you're going to be successful. You just got to put in the work and it's so simple. It's not easy, but it's so simple. You just got to be willing to put the work in. Yeah, simple but hard, right? So I couldn't agree with you more. And I want to go back to the Ferrent Bioneer situation, because this is such a missed opportunity for most agents, right? So what is Mark really doing? So let's just give an example. So Mark's, let's walk in through a neighborhood. He sees a Ferrent sign in the window of somebody's house. And it's got Ferrent call this number. You know, Mark might call that number and say, hey, are you the owner or are you the tenant or the management company or whatever? Mark eventually gets his way to the owner and says, hey, by the way, you know, yeah, I may have a renter for you at some point. But also have you thought about selling, right? This is a great way to have a conversation with somebody that might not know that they're ready to sell or may just be good timing or a great way to start the relationship so that when they are ready, obviously, you know, you would be the person that they select. And Mark, I will tell you, I've been in this industry 14 years and I've heard about, you know, calling for Ferrent Bioneers for since I started. And I would say maybe 1% of agents do that. And I think it is one of the biggest missed opportunities because you're right. Eventually, you hit a vein of investors. And they're like, oh, this is what we do all the time. And maybe they're not happy with whoever they're using. And you can obviously work your way in. And obviously, you did. So I love that. And so how was investor? She said 60, what percentage of your deals in the first year approximately were investor deals? Yeah, let's say, like I said, I was at least 60, 40 in my first year listing side versus buyer side. And then another, probably three quarters of those deals were working with investors. I don't do it. I'll be honest, I don't work with them as much anymore. It's just I've kind of transitioned to focusing more on the listing side. So I've kind of incorporated probate leads into everything. Let's talk about probate leads. Explain to our audience what those are and how you sort of got access to those. Yeah, so I mean, just going back to the rip off and duplicate thing. So I was on another podcast and I got connected with a gentleman, Chad Corbett, who runs, it's a course on probate and kind of walking you through that process, what it looks like, how to find business. So basically, create a website called NorthWest Indiana, statesolutions.com, the idea of being reaching out directly to, we can have access to through the court system, people that file probate in our county. So just giving them a call, walking through, hey, this is Mark. I'm a member of a local community group here in NorthWest in Indiana. We actually help families going through the probate process. So every month, we send a member of our team down to the county court house. They meet with the clerk and they actually provide us with a list of families. They think we might be able to help. So that's why I'm reaching out to you. You know, is there anything we can do to help you through? I know this is a particularly, is there anything in particular that you think might be able to help with? I know this is a difficult and stressful time in our goals is just try to alleviate as much of that as possible. And so just having that, yeah. So in probate is when wills and trusts maybe haven't been correctly established prior to death. Is that my understanding? Yes, sorry, I'm jumping into the framework. No, no, I just assume everyone's as dumb as me. And that's all I know about probate. So everyone else probably like, yeah, we know what probate is. But probate is when somebody passes away and there isn't sort of a obvious sort of and specific legal bait to distribute assets and they have to now go through the court systems. Is that accurate? That is accurate. Yes. So like I said, running through that script, calling through the list of probates and then trying to create relationship with local attorneys, just having that conversation of, you know, these are the benefits that we're offering to people. And we know they're in a difficult place. And they're lives right now, a lot of the personal representatives who are appointed either by the court or just the family is dictated that they take over and kind of run the probate process on their behalf. You know, the attorney has their, just like we have to work within the framework of what we do as real estate agents, they have to work within the framework of what they do as attorneys. So like a part of that business or the phone calls that I'm having with attorneys is just, hey, you know, what can I do to take something off of your plate to make your life easier? I know you don't want to deal with the real estate stuff. I have a list of contractor referrals. So if that comes up where someone within that estate, usually the biggest asset is real estate. So if someone within that estate needs to sell a piece of property and it might need work, hey, we have a list of contractors that we can team up with you. If you need anything at all, just call us and let us know. So just having those conversations with the PR and with the attorneys and yeah, I mean, just approaching it with empathy, right? Like they're going through a difficult situation. The more than likely they'd never gone through it before. So I think if you just have that conversation in a gentle way, like we're here for you, if you need anything at all, just reach out and then just this best week, I had an attorney reach out and probably have a referral for a listing and a market nearby. So I love that. I think just my personality and I want to help people and that's what we all should be striving to do. So it lends herself to being in that position. So I get a lot of satisfaction out of helping the people that needed them also. We've done almost 600 episodes of this show and nobody has ever mentioned probate leads. And what I realized with what you just were telling our audience is that calling probate attorneys might be a really good idea to develop relationships with because they, of course, have to do deal with assets and of course home usually being, if not the biggest, one of the biggest assets. And a lot of times, of course, offspring aren't living where mom and dad live. So it's this idea of we got to get rid of this property or we have to sell it or we want to sell it. But we need mom and dad lived in it for 40 years. So we have some work we need to do to it. And marks like, hey, I'm your solution. I can do all of that. And I think that is a brilliant strategy because we've had lots of people talking about divorce attorneys, a state planning attorneys, people that do have their rules and trusts in place before they pass away. Of course, those are great financial planners, account, you know, our asset. But no one has talked about probate attorneys. So love that idea. So R&D, rip and duplicate from Mark. Mark, I want to let's shift gears. I want to talk about move to highland.com because I think this is an amazing idea. So tell our audience what this is and why you built it. Yeah. So the owner of our brokerage, like I said, we're in Valparado in Indiana. He started the idea and from my understanding, at least as far as I know. So move to Valpo is a website. Again, rip off and duplicate. We took that and we just used that for highland. So through agent fire is a platform that I think it's pushed behind Tom Ferries program. Yeah. We created this website. It's called move to highland.com. Basically, like we view it as a community group trying to be a resource for people in the community to go to our website, understand things that are going on the community, but also drop people to the community that are thinking about making a move. So trying to get that SEO pushed up to the top. So when people are simply searching on Google, moving the highland in the end, we're trying to be at that top spot. But just giving them a resource for, you know, the specific neighborhoods in our market, things going on in the community. We have an IDX setup so that they can do their home search through through move to highland. And we as well, Jake and I, the other agent of all, to actually told me about your podcast. So shout out to Jacob, sure he's listening right now. But we created a community group within Facebook kind of doing the same thing. But we've seen success in just simple things like actually bought a rental property in April of 23. And we closed on the property. And the gentleman that was selling it, I was having a conversation with him in the kitchen of the property and started talking about his son and his, his just demon, right? His son's a stud football player at the at highland linebacker getting recruited by colleges like Stanford. So we just kind of took that around with it. I wrote a blog about it on our website. I published it on Facebook and I mean, we said people reaching out left and right. So I think just if you're looking for content creation and actually we're doing what we're doing, like pushing narratives of people in the town just to help again, like reinforce that community that I think every, every town in America probably lacks just leave with, you know, just where we are in the, in the current times that we live in. Yeah, everyone, I always kind of look back at the 50s. Like that was the golden era, right? Like, that just seemed like people everyone loved each other. I mean, I wasn't even born yet. So it's like a probably a not a pretty skewed vision of what reality. But yeah, I mean, I think we could all take a look back at that and like go back to a time where there was, we were heavily involved with Kenia. I think people would be a lot happier. So I agree. I think that's that's part of it is just trying to push and promote that agenda. And we should also mention too. So Highland is in Northwest Indiana. So it's it's closest big city is really Chicago. And Mark is is no, it was not unintentional. So Mark started look, you know, I live in the city of Chicago. And I would love to say that we're doing everything right here and people are flooding, you know, moving to Chicago. But sadly, that is not happening as much people are actually leaving Illinois due to, you know, a whole bunch of factors which I get very political and everyone has an opinion about. But the reality of it is people are moving. And they're moving to places like Northwest Indiana. It is not uncommon. Mark is not blind to that. He's not oblivious to that. And it's an amazing opportunity. Mark mentioned to finding that market was not accidental for you, you know, to tell us about how why you decided to really, in this case, you know, you did it with Alprezo. And now you're doing it with Highland. But Highland has, you know, this isn't just a random suburb that or a random city that you chose, right? No, you're here in San Crack. So I mean, in your right, 2021 and or 2020, 2021, I think Illinois was the number one state people were leaving during those two years. And Indiana was the number one state they were going to. So we're just over the border. We're considered a metro market, a submarket of Metro Chicago. We're about 45 minute drive away. And that's insulated us from a lot of these big swings just because especially Highland in particular, we're the second town over the border. So the people that want to avoid living in Illinois for, again, we won't get into the reasons. We won't need to travel into that. But yeah, we're a perfect spot to be in. So being close proximity to 1894, which is the inner state right there that gets you the Chicago's quickest possible. And then it was in 2022, I believe, Reader.com did a survey and they were tracking all these metrics of the most affordable markets in the United States. And they ran metrics like, you know, how quickly homes were under contract when listed, you know, what that price that's listed sale ratio was for each market. And out of the top 100 markets, we were number six in the country. Yeah, the, I mean, everyone's kind of struggling with inventory in their market. And that's been a huge driver in prices and availability and kind of the market we're seeing now. But we feel that probably more than most. So I mean, there's 14 active listings in Highland right now, which is just incredibly low. So I mean, as soon as homes are listed, they're selling. So we have that built in desirability of being in that close proximity to a major metro city like Chicago. So yeah, I mean, that was, it helps that Jake and I both live in Highland. We grew up here. We know the market well, but yeah, I don't think we'd be pushing as hard on all this and going the route that we're going had those things not been in place. So yeah, that definitely played an important factor. It's a really good, good point to everyone listening to know where the closest areas outside of your local market that people sort of move to. Obviously, you know, people make big moves down. Well, in our case, would be like down to Florida or Texas or Arizona from Illinois, you know, retirement. A lot of times people do that. And, but we're seeing this migration from Chicago to North West Indiana for taxes and, you know, political, you know, reasons and just, you know, things they don't like about Illinois. But every community has some version of that, right? And there's like this other place where people can go to. And so Marx, it's really smart, because Marx can then develop relationships. So even if people in Northwest Indiana, eventually they're going to possibly leave and go elsewhere, you know, maybe going down south. And so Marx is going to build this. He's built a network of agents that he can refer to as his clientele age and decide, you know, to move. And, you know, so he's, you're building relationships all over the place with, you know, with attorneys, you're building relationships with other agents. And you're also looking to see where people are moving towards. And it just happens to be where you grew up, which, which of course is a huge, a huge benefit. I wanted to ask about for sale by owners, because and expires and canceled, right? So, so these are the, these are the leads that are very easy to purchase, right? There's lots of companies that will sell you this information for very little money, really. It's a very inexpensive lead source. But it's an expensive reason, because it's actually quite difficult. And so as a result, a lot of people don't have success with those calls. They don't like making them or they, they, they're tough. But you have had a lot of success with those. So can you tell us a little bit about, you know, let's, let's say you called and expired. So just to set the scene, this is somebody who worked with it with an agent. It didn't go well. It didn't close or it didn't get sold. And now the listing is expired. You know, how did those calls go for you? Yeah. Yeah. That's a good question. And yeah, just going back to your point super quick. Super cheap lead sources, right? Again, a big part of my business is like, I could go, you know, that Zillow, no knock on it on anyone that's pursuing that. But again, I didn't fit my framework of, I didn't want to work with buyers. And profitability for me is number one, like for sale by owners are free. I can just go on zill and pull that information their phone over and then yeah, expires. I mean, I just 15 bucks a month and I have a white pages online subscription. I get their phone number and make the call. Just pull it every day and make the call. And I just closed one on Friday and just went on under contract on one last week. So yeah, we could walk through it. You're put me on the spot. I don't have my notes in front of me. I don't, but I shouldn't need them. But we can, well, no, no, I guess what I'm saying is they're, they can be difficult phone calls because these are either whether it's an expired or canceled or a sale by owner. These are all people that are either choosing actively not to work with a REALTOR or who I've worked with a REALTOR and didn't get the result they desired. So these can be tricky because you can get people who are not receptive to an agent's phone call and you're not the only person that is buying those leads as well. Other agents, of course, are buying them and are also calling. So the challenge sometimes is, you know, yeah, you might you might have the best pitch in the world, but you're the seventh guy, the call that person that day and they might just be like, oh, stop calling. And you're like, I just called for the first time. So how, how, how, though they're tricky, I guess the point is they're tricky, but they're working for you. So do you find there's a lot of competition with those calls? Are there agents making those dials alongside you, you know, from other firms? Yeah, absolutely. And just to challenge you on the, they're tricky. They're difficult conversations, but they're not that bad. They're not as bad as everyone says they are. If you have the correct framework and we can walk through it, if you want to run through the for sale by ownership, let's do it. I can explain. I would love to. All right, don't give me an objection. Give me even my, you know, my cousins and agent. Okay. And I can kind of, you know, I might not be perfect on this because sure we'll see, but yeah. All right. So I'll ring and then you answer the phone. Got it. Really? Hey, this is Mark. Plus, I'm a local REALTOR here in Northwest in, you know, I was calling about the property for sale over on Main Street. Okay. Yeah. Yeah, like I said, I see their sell them by owner. I completely respect that. You know, I was just curious if 30 days were to go by and the home doesn't sell for some reason, at that point in time, would you be open interviewing listening agents? Well, maybe, but I already have someone in my family that would do it for me. Yeah, no, I completely understand and listen, I hope my family and friends would say the exact same thing and show me that loyalty. So, you know, I can definitely appreciate that. You know, I'm just looking at the pictures on the listing on Zillow. It looks like a beautiful home. You know, I'm just curious. Why are you even considering moving in the first place? Oh, we're retiring and moving to another, another part of the country. Okay. Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. Hopefully, some were warmer than than where we're at right now, right? Yes. Yeah. Okay. Well, listen, I understand you have another agent, agent in mind, and you're probably going to go that route. But would it be helpful if I, if I shout over my resume and that way, you could just have it on file, you know, just in the case that you decide to go another route or get a second opinion, would you be opposed to that? No, we have feel free to send it over. Okay, great. Well, yeah, I'll get your email address and then I'll send that information over. You know, what I can do, you know, I'm always in the area, would you be opposed to me popping by one day this week, just so I can take a look at the property, kind of get an understanding of a little bit more understanding your situation. And, you know, maybe that can cross reference my buyer list that I have and see if there's someone that I think might be a good fit. Is that something you'd be opposed to if I just pop by quick one day this week? Sure, I guess that's okay. Okay. Yeah. And like I said, what I can do when I'm there is I'll bring my FSBO backup plan. I can walk you through that process, feel free to steal any of my tips and tricks. We have, you know, built in marketing system and a pricing strategy that we use to sell all of our listings quicker than the market average. Like I said, feel free to take steal any of that information you want, but at least this way, you're your arm going forward. And can I ask you one more thing really quick? Sure. Yeah, would you be opposed to, you know, me checking in with you after that meeting every every few days and what I'll do is I'll send you tips. I can walk you through what that purchase agreement looks like, you know, negotiable terms. And like I said, you know, after our meeting and I understand that you have another agent that you might work with, but maybe after our meeting, you know, we have a conversation and see if it makes sense to work together in the future. Is that fair? Absolutely fair. Okay. Well, great. Well, and then yeah, just set the appointments in yeah, no, that was that was brilliant because what Mark did and from my interpretation, Mark, please correct me if I miss, miss judge that, but Mark led with value. He, number one, he didn't try to overcome an objection, right? If somebody's cousin is the REALTOR, you're not going to say, well, I'm sure I'm better in your cousin. He's not going to say that. Or do you like your cousin or whatever, but the reality of it is he's got that, that hill to climb. And what he did is said, hey, I get it. Yeah, I would work with my cousin too. I hope my cousin would work with me. And I'd also like to give you a second opinion. And I have some ideas. Can I swing by and just kind of take a quick look, get a better sense of the property. Even if you don't use me, you can still take some of the ideas I might be able to help you sell the home a little faster. Maybe we'll work together in the future, maybe not even on this transaction, but I'm going to, and then I'm going to follow up with you like what he said was brilliant because it made it very difficult for me to say no, because it was like he was giving me things. He was just saying, hey, can I give this to you? Can I give this to you? Can I give this to you? All things to help me with my stated objective, which is get the home sold. Right. So whether or not, and I'm going to always as a consumer, I'm going to always choose anyone in my life as a service provider who provides the most value. I'm just always going to do that. I mean, yes, if my sister was a REALTOR, I'd always go with my sister outside of that situation. She's not a REALTOR, but inside of that outside of that situation, I'm going with whoever provides value. So is that my understanding? You're leading with like education and value? Yeah, I'm not trying to handle objections. It was the big thing you said, I'm not going to, I'm not going to convince someone to list their home with me over the phone nine times out of 10, but what I need to do is get in front of them in person, set that appointment, so that you can kind of build on that. And you're, you're almost qualifying that appointment, just like you would with a buyer. So you start trying to get that email address. And depending on you can even take it as far as like DJ, when I said, you know, I'm calling about the home for sale on main street. If DJ are like, yeah, yeah, what do you need? How can I help you if they're like bubbly and I feel that in the personality, I'll even change my script and say, yeah, no, I'm sure you've been, I'm sure you've been having phone calls from every age in the late county all morning long. So, you know, I apologize on behalf of all of us, but that's a great thing to say. I love that by the way. I say, I've, I've used a version of that when I recruit REALTORS. So I recruit REALTORS for our firm. And what happens is when somebody passes their real estate exam in Illinois, the testing center sells that information to every brokerage in town. So it's very similar to sale by owner leads. So all of a sudden, all these brokerages who are looking to hire REALTORS, we all get the same list at the same time. And so I say, hey, you're probably very popular right now. You're probably getting a lot of calls, probably more than you want. I apologize for that. And, you know, and then you just kind of go from there, see your acknowledging their reality, which is great because there's a lot of agents that just want to steamroll over try to get the sale and you're sort of acknowledging the current situation and still trying to add value. Yeah, no, you're right. And it's same thing, like, you have that, you have that natural built-in sales reactants, right? As soon as you're phone rings, and I say, I'm a REALTOR, you're like, you're in that fight or fight mode. You're like, you're hanging up. You're gonna yell at me. But if you, if you can nip that in the bud right away, and it's the analogy that I always heard that I love, like, imagine walking on a, the second you step foot on a car lot, you're gonna approach by a used car salesman, which, okay, and your natural resistance is like, they're saying, you know, can I help you with anything? And your natural thing to say is, no, well, then 10 minutes later, you find the car you want, then now you need to go approach that person to get the keys, right? Like, it, it's just their mentality, which I get, and we're all wired that way. So if you can approach the conversation, like you said, leading with value, being nice is monumentally important. When you mentioned me having going up against other agents on these phone calls, yeah, they're, you know, it's probably not as bad here as it is in Chicago, where you have 50,000 agents and Cook County alone, probably, yeah, we do. 3,000. So we have 3,000. So I think there's about 10 on average, the call for sale by owners in my market. And, you know, I don't want to sound arrogant, but I'm told this by the sellers, you know, more often than not, they're choosing me. And it's simply because I approach the whole conversation differently than what, then how they are. And they're, they're trying to overcome objections over the phone, telling them their price too high, telling them they're never selling their own, they'll, you know, they'll net more money. Listen, I believe that, but I'm not going to, in the initial phone call, I'm not going to bring that up and walk them through that conversation. It just, it doesn't make sense. Um, so, here's why you failed, Mr. Seller. You're not, you're not going to do that. Yeah. Yeah. Here's what he did wrong. Um, and, and, and, you know, maybe there's a certain percentage of people that respond well to that, but it is a tiny percentage that responded well to, hey, I, I can help you. Here's what, here's all the things you did wrong. You know what they did wrong because obviously you're an agent and, you know, they priced it to high, almost 99% of the case. But what Mark's doing is saying, Hey, I need to come and take a look at this. And then he's, he's basically doing what consultants do. Let me come take a look, see what the situation is and I'll come back to you with some ideas and feel free to take them or not. I just want to try to earn your business going forward. So it's, it's a really brilliant strategy because again, it makes it very hard to say no to because Mark's not asking for anything. You're all, the only thing you were asking for is can I send, can I come by and is it okay if I follow up and send you some stuff like who would say, you know, if anyone says no to that, I guess you just move on and make another call, but it's a pretty hard thing to say no to. Yeah, and I'll find seven or eight out of ten or saying yes, and I'm not getting pushed back as long as I'm, yes, as long as they're giving me that opening in the beginning, I'm setting an appointment quite regularly. And even like, like you mentioned, they might not hire me in that particular instance, but there was 2021, was probably around the first time I was calling for sale by owners and I had a conversation with a lady named Julie who was a FSBO and a town a few, few towns over. I call Julie every week for five weeks. She gave me that opening. I never set the appointment, but you know, it was offering value like, hey, how, you know, I didn't trash her pictures too bad, but they were taken with the cell phone. I'm like, here's the, here's a contact info for the photographer we use to do professional photography and video walkthroughs that we use for every, every one of our listings. Just trying to give her tips and advice on how to sell the home on her own. She ended up selling on her own, okay? Shoot, I missed that on the sale. I it's early 2023. I'm sitting on my couch and I get a phone call late at night and it's Julie. She said, hey, I don't know if you remember me. We talked, you know, two years ago, but I saved you in my phone. My in-laws are getting ready to sell a property in the same town that she was in. That was a half a million dollar property. Sitting at the listing appointment, she pulls out her phone. She's like, do you remember I told you like, I saved you on my phone. She just saved me on her phone as a REALTOR nice guy. I don't even think, I think my name was Mark REALTOR nice guy. So I mean, just because you don't get to sale at first time, you're having conversations. You're talking to people and it leads to business. So yeah, if I could just say one thing, don't be scared to have, like just go out there, have conversations. It's never gonna be a bad thing. Yeah, and even if the person is rude or hangs up on you, oh well, it's not personal. It's just that you were the ninth person to call him if it's an expired and it happens and you know, you say, okay, well, maybe I'll try again, you know, in a few days or I'll just move on to the next call. But 70 to 80% of the time, they're like, yeah, come on by and send me some info. I mean, that's incredible, incredible results. So we've been hearing for years, Fisbeau's of Dad, expires are dead, canceled listings are dead, canceled yeah, cancel listings are dead. No, they're not. You just have to take a different approach. And why is Mark doing all of this? Because he wants to protect his nights and weekends, right? This is really, he wants to do listings. He's got four kids. He wants to be there. And he's not, you know, maybe you're doing an open house here and there. Obviously, that's great, great thing. But he wants listings. He doesn't want to drive buyers around at nights and weekends, makes sense. And so he just reversed sends to near it and figured out a way to make it work. And guys, this is such, I love talking to people like this because everyone, you know, so many agents get into this industry because they just want to do like what they see maybe on television, you know, these lug, these just luxury buyers or luxury sellers. And all of that's great. And obviously, there's agents for that as well. But there are so many other ways to build a repeatable and sustainable business. And often it's by doing the activities that other agents won't do. And so when you see that for Rentsign as Mark said at the beginning, you know, written and, you know, from a Home Depot for Rentsign with somebody's, you know, a handwritten phone number on it, that's probably a sign that it's a mom and pop who run that, who own that building. It's probably not a big management company or also maybe have a different type of sign or if you see it online on, you know, Craigslist or Zillow or apartments.com, you know, somebody clearly it's not an agent posting a rental. That's a great phone call for Mark because he's going to call and say, Hey, I'd love to chat with the owner. Is he the owner? And brilliant, brilliant stuff. And again, you know, you're having conversations about real estate. You're talking to people that have not even yet sometimes raised their hand, right? Now for expires, Fisbeau's, obviously, those are people that are obviously in the market at the time. But you're, I love the for sale or sorry, the for rent by owners is the is kind of the forgotten group in real estate for leads. So I, and you could also help them on the rental side if they're not ready to sell as well. And you could just start developing the relationship there. Say, how can help you find tenants for you? And, you know, do you have any other properties? Do you do other stuff? Are you an investor in other ways? What's your long-term strategy with this property? Do you want to sell it at some point? Well, let me, let's start talking about it. I can run some numbers for you. I mean, this is, these are ways in and Mark, I could not be more impressed with your ability to sort of do to do these. What do you sort of see going forward? Do you see anything trending that's changing your business at all? Like, you know, is there still a lot of opportunity for investment? Is the investor, you said you're not working with as many investors now because you want to switch over to listings. How is that transition going from investors to listings? Yeah, that's a great question. The market dictates, dictates so much of that in my opinion. And there's a little thing, you know, the commission lawsuit that's going on, that kind of plays in the system. It's kind of a big deal. Yeah. So, I mean, knowing the market, knowing we're going, if you work with investors right now, you know with the interest rates being the way they are, I mean, there's cash buyers out there, right? We usually those properties are pretty distressed. But if you're finding something on the market, we're kind of in this weird, this weird place, we're inventory is super low, but with the interest rates, you know, certain homes are overpriced, sit for a while. So yeah, I mean, if there's an investor out there that's going to need a loan, and you can negotiate a credit to buy it on that rate, that makes a lot of sense. But for me, I'm letting the market dictate my actions. So I'm going deeper in listings. So that's why the probate thing is I'm being very intentional about and trying to grow that as much as I am because unfortunately, the unfortunate reality is, I mean, the baby boomer generation is gigantic. Those people pass away and they typically have a home to sell. So just leading with that thought that there's inventory out there that's going to be hitting the market. And if I can create that relationship with an attorney and have the first, the first shot at getting those listings, I mean, that's got to be up there for people I think and it is obviously for me. I'm relying heavily. I mean, this is going in the year four for me. The whole intent of this business was to just be professional, be an advisor in the sense that I do such a good job. Or my goal is to do such a good job that I'm getting referrals and repeat business out of my clients. And that's what the business has evolved to. So doubling down on that, making sure I'm staying in front of my S O I with postcards, events, sending the clients the closed transactions really in their settlement statements so that they can be prepared for their taxes. Like little things like that to stay in front of my clients all the time, my past clients. And just asking for referrals, like not again, you brought it up with the FSBO and expired. Those are things that a lot of agents shy away from. They're the difficult things. But to me, that's where that's what the success success can be found. So yet doubling down on things like that, doing the difficult things that people don't want to do. The agents don't want to do. That's been monumentally important in my business. And I mean, asking for referrals, it's you can do all of these things in a way that makes you feel kind of cringy or you can find out a way where you're adding value to them. You're just asking for their help as simple as that sometimes. I walked you through this transaction. It went awesome. You left me a five-star Google review. It would be so helpful for my business and my family if you were to, if you hear about anyone, any friend or family looking to buy yourself, just share my name, like simple stuff like that. It's so easy, but people are scared to do it. You know, they shouldn't be because you just, I like that you use the word family because you do have a family and you are a father. And it is important because it is how you provide for your family. And so to be able to say to somebody, hey, I'm so glad you had a great experience with me. And then to add in, you know, if you ever hear anybody talking about real estate needs, I'd be honored if you'd consider passing that information over to me or passing my information over to them. It really does it only just help me, but it really helps support my family as well. I think that is a perfectly acceptable thing to say. And it's true. And I love the idea of saying this is, I mean, I love the honesty of that, I think is absolutely commendable and courageous to say, to use the word family because what's more important than family, right? Not much. So I couldn't agree. Boy, Mark, I could, I could pick your brain for all these little tricks and tips and not tricks. I mean, they're authentic strategies, but I could pick your brain for all these little tips for the next several hours. But I think this is actually a great place to wrap up because you have provided an incredible amount of value. We even did a role-playing session, which was actually really helpful for me. So I can better, maybe I will, well, I'm going to send this to all of we about 800 agents. So I'm going to send this to our 800 agents going, Hey, here's somebody who is doing what you probably don't want to do because you think it's hard and difficult, especially Fisbeau's expires and canceled. But here's somebody and here's the exact way he does it and give it a shot and see what kind of response you get because you're right. Mark said this at the beginning. He said, it's all about your SOI, your sphere of influence. How do we continually add value so that people want to be in our sphere of influence? And, you know, first, how do we get to them and how do we give them value so that they stay in our orbit for as long as possible and hopefully, you know, not only do they become clients, but they tell other people, gosh, this guy, Mark, I've never even done a transaction with him, but he sends me all sorts of great information. He's a good guy. I feel like, you know, I should pass him in for past some clients over to him. So guys, I could not agree with Mark's strategy more effectively. I couldn't agree with it more. I think it's one of the most effective ways to grow one's business, lead with value. Love that. And Mark, one other thing I just wanted to say, Mark is somebody who pivots. So Mark said, Hey, my actions are dictated by the market. I love that because here's what Mark's not saying. Oh, it's so hard right now. Inventory's low. The interest rates are high. None of my clients really want to do anything. Mark's like, Okay, I'm going to figure out a different way to do it. I'm just going to pivot and go where where the action is. And I suspect if everything changes next year, you might pivot again and pivot to more opportunities because that's what successful agents do. They pivot. They find opportunities. They make adjustments and they roll with whatever the market conditions are because you don't have much control over that anyway. So I love the fact that you're taking back control by finding those opportunities and not just going, Well, I guess I have to wait till rates come down before my buyers get off the fence. So really, Mark, this was awesome. I congratulate you on, you know, three to four years in the business, crushing it 32 deals in your first year. That is not an accident. That is not a stroke of good luck. What I was hoping, I was a little worried when I first asked you because I thought, What if he says, Well, my wife's business has like a thousand age, a thousand people there. My wife's family's business. And all those people used to be, I was like, Oh, well, not everywhere. And Mark's like, No, that's not really where I got my business. I actually went out and saw on my so I love your country. Contrary to that is actually what happened. I was very vocal with the fact that I made that move and I did not want to work with buyers. And I did not want to that schedule was so bad. I've been working late and then going, I lost out quite a bit of business because of the things I was saying to family members. And so yeah, I mean, there was quite a few employees at that company that did not use me my first year. So actually funny. Bring that up. Yeah, it hurts. Thank Mark on behalf of our audience. Mark is a younger broker who is really country. He had a nice guy and I'm so glad that you you came on our show today. I want everyone to check to take a look, you know, we talk about specializing in especially in a geographic area. Mark has done this. He's built web properties to help people who are thinking about moving to those areas so that they can hopefully be the part of the agent they use. So move to Hyland.com. He has moved to Balpo as well. We'll put links to those in the show notes. But I wanted you to see what Mark and his team provide. And also if you are an agent in the Northwest Indiana area or if you're an actual agent in Indiana and Illinois and you work in the Northwest Indiana area and you're looking maybe to see if there's another company or team out there that would be a good fit. Mark and his team they are growing obviously and expanding and they would love the opportunity to see if you guys could work together. So Mark, if there are any agents that are looking to maybe see what other firms offer, what's the best way they should reach out? Yeah, they could just reach out directly to me or our brokerage and just check out brokerworks.com. Andrew Canese is the owner of the brokerage. Super smart guy didn't start here. I made the jump after meeting Andrew and yeah, I've taken a lot of the information I shared today from him. So super smart guy knows the business super well. I love it here. So yeah, and the other thing if you're an agent and you're in that Chicago market and you know your sellers leave in and coming over here. Feel free to give us a call.

He's killing it and we know he's his clients think that this is a nice guy and that's that's that's about as good of a compliment and he's been he's even in someone's trust.
