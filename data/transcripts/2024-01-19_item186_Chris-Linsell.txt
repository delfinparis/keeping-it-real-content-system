[00:03:00] Chris, welcome to the show once again.
[00:03:03] DJ, glad to be back.
[00:03:05] Thanks for having me.
[00:03:06] Happy New Year, 2024.
[00:03:07] Here we are.
[00:03:08] Happy New Year.
[00:03:09] And I would also just really quickly like to say thank you to our audience.
[00:03:13] I got a very nice holiday gift.
[00:03:15] I try not to bog myself down in the metrics of our show.
[00:03:21] However, we did have our very biggest month ever, which I didn't even know.
[00:03:25] I don't ever look at December numbers because they were always the lowest of the year.
[00:03:29] But my marketing person shared our statistics just the other day with me for December.
[00:03:33] I was like, don't show me and he goes, no, you want to see these?
[00:03:35] And they were actually up.
[00:03:37] So thanks in part to Chris.
[00:03:39] Chris has actually been part of our show for years.
[00:03:41] And we have a new feature for him now, which was very exciting, called unpopular real estate opinions.
[00:03:49] So we, this is our second episode in this series.
[00:03:52] We'll be doing this monthly.
[00:03:54] Chris, let's jump right into it.
[00:03:56] What's, what's unpopular right now in your mind?
[00:04:00] Oh, man.
[00:04:01] Well, DJ, again, thanks for having me back.
[00:04:04] I love that every, every time we get together now, I get to bring some of the topics that I talk
[00:04:11] about with people on social and in person.
[00:04:15] And I'm just kind of earmarking all the ones that people yell at me the most about so that
[00:04:20] I can share them with you because just because people don't like it doesn't mean it ain't
[00:04:25] true.
[00:04:26] So I've got a few unpopular opinions that maybe we should chat about.
[00:04:31] The first is, and you know, take this with a grain of salt here.
[00:04:37] But the first is, 2024 is going to be a terrible year for real estate until it's not.
[00:04:46] And I know that sounds like a really weird way of saying it.
[00:04:49] But basically, what I'm trying to get at here is that the beginning of 2024 is going
[00:04:56] to be challenging.
[00:04:58] We've got a lot of people who are prognosticating that 2024, the new year, it's going to be a brand
[00:05:03] new leaf.
[00:05:04] I don't think so, man.
[00:05:05] I think that the first half of 2024 is still going to be very challenging for a number
[00:05:10] of reasons.
[00:05:12] But the second half of 2024 is likely to be one of the busiest times in real estate that
[00:05:20] we've seen in a long time, a certain, certainly compared to the first half of the year.
[00:05:25] So for agents who are looking to do some forecasting for themselves on this year, I would be forecasting
[00:05:33] pretty lean until about June.
[00:05:35] And then get your roller skate song, because that's the only way you're going to be able
[00:05:38] to get to and from fast enough to serve us all the clients that you're going to have.
[00:05:44] Yeah.
[00:05:45] And I think, I think you're right.
[00:05:46] So it really will be sort of this diametrically opposed in your mind, sort of halves of the
[00:05:53] year.
[00:05:54] So we'll have the have-nots maybe in the first half of the year due to market constriction.
[00:06:01] We've got high interest rates.
[00:06:03] We have low inventory.
[00:06:04] We just have less activity.
[00:06:05] Quite.
[00:06:06] Yeah.
[00:06:06] And you know, here's the reason why this tends to be kind of a flashpoint issue for folks
[00:06:12] is ultimately some of the reasons why I think 2024, the second half is going to accelerate.
[00:06:19] And not necessarily for the better of our clients, honestly, is we have in 2023 experienced
[00:06:27] this incredible constriction of the market just in general.
[00:06:32] I mean, it was just it was a hard time to buy and sell a home in the United States.
[00:06:36] And I'll even say hard time to sell a home, even though homes are fetching record prices,
[00:06:46] it's just a difficult time to sell because the markets feel so uncertain at the moment.
[00:06:51] And that's making sellers nervous.
[00:06:54] We've just we experienced some record constriction in 2023 and 2024 is going to be the year
[00:07:05] where all of the pent up demand that occurred through 2023 and frankly still some leftover
[00:07:13] pent up demand in COVID, that's going to kind of break loose.
[00:07:19] And that's going to be really exciting and interesting.
[00:07:23] But the reason why this is kind of an unpopular conversation topic is I don't think this is
[00:07:28] necessarily to the benefit of our clients because we're going to go from having quiet
[00:07:35] challenging markets to extraordinarily hot and competitive markets.
[00:07:39] We're going to see whiplash amongst our buyers very, very quickly.
[00:07:44] Sellers with unrealistic timelines.
[00:07:47] And then you're going to layer in on top of all of that these lawsuits faced by NAR that are
[00:07:54] going to create a whole new level of uncertainty around commissions, which is not something that
[00:08:01] was a part of the conversation from COVID through 2023.
[00:08:05] I guess the second half of 2023, but it's going to be a busy year in real estate real estate
[00:08:11] professionals need to keep their head on straight.
[00:08:14] If they actually want to translate that busyness into benefit for their clients, do you believe
[00:08:21] that that in the upcoming, let's say 24 next 24 months that there will be any reform to buyer
[00:08:31] side commissions?
[00:08:32] Great question.
[00:08:33] Where are they going to have to come to the table with cash?
[00:08:38] Is it going to be built into their mortgage if they have one or is it still going to be
[00:08:43] all technically sourced by the seller and just maybe more transparently split?
[00:08:49] Great question.
[00:08:51] Here's a couple of things that I am confident it will not be.
[00:08:54] I'm confident it will not be built into a mortgage.
[00:08:58] The reason behind that is 99%, maybe 98 and a half percent of mortgages in the United States
[00:09:07] have particular stipulations that regulate that only real property can be used as a, this
[00:09:16] tool can only be used to finance real property.
[00:09:19] Though there are certain percentage level exceptions to that, that conveniently get applied
[00:09:27] by the banks and not by outside sources, you can actually roll in your closing costs
[00:09:33] in some loans into the mortgageable amount.
[00:09:36] Banks are happy to charge you interest on that stuff.
[00:09:40] But the other fees and costs associated with real estate, I think will be a very challenging
[00:09:47] hill to climb as far as rolling them into mortgages.
[00:09:50] To your specific question about whether or not I think we'll see any reform, the answer
[00:09:56] is yes, but I think the reform will occur on the level of professional bodies.
[00:10:05] I don't see the United States as a governmental body passing any kind of mortgage reform in
[00:10:12] the next 24 months.
[00:10:14] That may be a commentary on the state of politics in the United States, but just generally speaking
[00:10:20] that seems like a no-win issue because you have particular interests on the part of consumers
[00:10:28] that happen to also kind of come up at odds with the interests of one of the largest professional
[00:10:37] advocacy groups in the entire country, almost the world in NAR.
[00:10:42] So I don't think there will be any kind of movement from a legal perspective there, but I
[00:10:48] do think NAR will likely install some new internal professional regulations, but they are
[00:10:58] just going to be tweaks to the existing laws, regs, which basically says you can offer
[00:11:10] optionally to pay a buyer's agent.
[00:11:13] It is not an assumed requirement like it is now basically which is what got NAR in trouble
[00:11:20] before.
[00:11:21] It's going to become optional.
[00:11:23] You can choose whether or not you want to offer a buyer's side and that just will become
[00:11:29] more explicit.
[00:11:30] What does that actually change pretty damn close to nothing, frankly?
[00:11:35] I think we are going to, and again, unpopularly, I understand this is going to be to the detriment
[00:11:42] of our consumers and the detriment of us professionally because it's just going to extend the quagmire
[00:11:50] through which we have to wade through on this issue.
[00:11:54] 2024 is going to be a year where we have to explain to every single client why that lawsuit
[00:12:00] happened, what the results were and what it means to them.
[00:12:05] The real sticky wicket clients are going to be insisting that things change even though
[00:12:10] they don't even know what they want them to change to other than they just want to pay
[00:12:14] less.
[00:12:16] This is going to be a year where we should start rehearsing that conversation because
[00:12:21] again, first half of the year it's going to be pretty quiet.
[00:12:24] The second half of the year there's going to be an incredible amount of activity so you're
[00:12:27] going to be having this conversation on a regular basis with people.
[00:12:31] So if we do assume that the second half of the year quarter is three and four are going
[00:12:39] to be more active, more buyers, certainly as rates decline, which we hope happens and
[00:12:46] seems to be what the economists are predicting.
[00:12:48] Would you recommend as an agent today to really encourage the both sides buyer and seller
[00:12:58] or just one or neither to participate in the market before it gets flooded with competition?
[00:13:05] Oh, big time.
[00:13:06] 100%.
[00:13:07] In fact, the real like the purchasing power of dollars is going to be, I'm sorry, let me
[00:13:16] rephrase that.
[00:13:18] The purchasing power of buyers is going to be measurably higher in the first half of the
[00:13:26] year.
[00:13:27] And the reason behind this is, you know, Lawrence, you know, from from NAR chief economist
[00:13:34] from NAR has has publicly predicted that he expects to see interest rates.
[00:13:42] Hold steady for the first quarter or third of the year and then start to trickle down.
[00:13:48] That start that when we see mortgage rates trickle down, I am willing to bet, I'm willing
[00:13:56] to bet the backyard on the fact that when we see four weeks in a row of trickle down mortgage
[00:14:03] rates, we're going to see an increase out of out of that a disproportionately large
[00:14:13] increase in buyer activity.
[00:14:15] So the reduction in mortgage rates are going to be offset by this buyer activity.
[00:14:21] And it's going to make it harder and more expensive at the end of the day to buy a house
[00:14:25] because even though that rate is going to go down, the competition is going to go up
[00:14:30] by disproportionate percentage.
[00:14:32] So if you have clients who are waiting on the sidelines right now saying, well, I'm not,
[00:14:38] I'm ready to buy a house, but I'm not going to buy it until I have a mortgage rate that,
[00:14:42] you know, starts with 6.2.
[00:14:44] Uh, these are people who, uh, the banks are just salivating over because yeah, they
[00:14:52] might get a 6.2% mortgage rate, but the purchase price in their home isn't going to be $410,000
[00:14:59] or whatever the median price is right now.
[00:15:02] It's going to be $460,000.
[00:15:04] So they're going to make more money.
[00:15:05] The banks will make more money at lower rates if we see that trickled that slow trickle
[00:15:10] down.
[00:15:11] Um, 2024 is going to be a challenging year, um, to get the timing right.
[00:15:16] And whenever I say, uh, whenever I'm talking to people about how, uh, to effectively service
[00:15:23] the real estate clients, when it comes to market timing, I always tell them, if you have a
[00:15:30] client who thinks that they're going to time the market, this is somebody that you should
[00:15:36] refer because this is somebody who will waste your time.
[00:15:40] And when it is actually time, when they actually feel like they're activated, they will never
[00:15:46] be satisfied because the window for their success is non-existent despite what they actually
[00:15:52] say.
[00:15:53] Yeah, it's just, it's a very strong point.
[00:15:57] Um, yes.
[00:15:58] And that, that being said, as an agent today, what would be, I think, really beneficial
[00:16:05] is that REALTORS start proactively contacting clients and having these conversations and
[00:16:11] having this explanation of, here's why it might make sense to list today or to get into
[00:16:18] the buyer side, um, you know, and talking about there are creative financing solutions.
[00:16:23] I know we wanted to get into some, some solutions to help, uh, help buyers a little bit more
[00:16:28] when it illustrates our high, but also, um, just having the conversation of it, it's very
[00:16:33] similar to having the, the buy low sell high conversation when, when, you know, we're talking
[00:16:38] about securities and financial advisors, um, you know, if they're, if they're worth their
[00:16:42] assault, they, uh, you know, once a stock is up, significantly, it's not the time to
[00:16:48] purchase traditionally.
[00:16:49] Uh, so, but, but psychologically, it feels like the time to buy because things are looking
[00:16:54] good, um, in the, in the stock market.
[00:16:56] So we, we know that logically, but emotionally, that's sort of the hurdle people have to
[00:17:00] get over.
[00:17:01] And I think the emotional hurdle gets extinguished or, or gets cleared, uh, very easily with
[00:17:07] logic.
[00:17:07] But I think it has, it information, it has to be communicated.
[00:17:11] And that's not necessarily the message that I'm seeing a lot on, uh, in, in the media
[00:17:17] right now.
[00:17:18] I'm seeing a lot of, um, yeah, talk about mortgage rates.
[00:17:22] I'm not seeing a lot of talk about whether it's actually a good time to purchase and what
[00:17:27] the logic behind that is, uh, or to sell.
[00:17:30] And, and I think this is where a REALTOR can really earn their stripes by reaching out
[00:17:35] to their clients and saying, Hey, here's what really is not being talked about.
[00:17:38] And if you have data to back it up, even better to say, you know, let's go back a couple
[00:17:43] of years when rates were below 4%.
[00:17:45] And let's take a look at what the average prices of homes you might be looking at purchasing.
[00:17:49] Let's see what they closed for.
[00:17:51] Let's see what they listed for and let's see what they closed for.
[00:17:53] And let's remember what the, what those times were.
[00:17:56] If you were an agent back then, if not, the data is there.
[00:17:58] You can go back and look and you will, you will, you know, we, we can all shutter from,
[00:18:03] from a little bit of those times about how difficult it was to just do much of anything.
[00:18:08] If you're on the buy side, 100%.
[00:18:10] In fact, any agents, I'm going to give, I'm going to give anybody who's listening.
[00:18:14] If you are feeling motivated by DJs, um, golden words of wisdom, which you also feel
[00:18:20] motivated by here.
[00:18:22] Um, if you are, are, if you just made a mental note, um, that you need to start talking to
[00:18:27] your clients about opportunities relative to kind of the expected timing of this market,
[00:18:32] I'm going to give you some ammunition here.
[00:18:34] Um, and this is actually, again, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going
[00:18:38] to use an unpopular opinion here.
[00:18:40] Everyone who's listening to this, take it, steal this, put this in your quiver as a provocative
[00:18:46] topic to get a conversation started real estate in 2024 is not going to have an inventory
[00:18:53] problem.
[00:18:53] It's going to have a mortgage problem.
[00:18:56] And what I mean by that is, yeah, it's true that we don't have enough, enough inventory
[00:19:02] to service the needs of the buyers, but the root of the inventory problem is mortgage
[00:19:08] rates.
[00:19:09] And, um, we were talking earlier, remind me what you said, what, what percentage of, of
[00:19:14] homeowners in the United States currently have a mortgage rate less than 5%, 85% 85.
[00:19:21] I mean, that's insane.
[00:19:23] 85 out of every 100 homeowners have a mortgage rate of less than 5%.
[00:19:28] And I would venture to guess, I don't have the numbers in front of me.
[00:19:31] Excuse me, but I would venture to guess there's a sizeable percentage of people with
[00:19:37] a mortgage rate of less than 4% right now.
[00:19:41] And so this is a choke point in the inventory cycle that is going to create havoc for, um,
[00:19:54] for inventory issues.
[00:19:56] And again, it is, this is a mortgage problem.
[00:19:59] If you are, if you want to take DJ's advice and start having these conversations open
[00:20:05] with that line, we don't have an inventory, we have problem, we have a mortgage problem.
[00:20:09] And then you can, you can stretch out DJ's suggestions around the sorts of things that
[00:20:19] you should do to facilitate that conversation.
[00:20:22] Take it a step further.
[00:20:24] We have data from just, I mean, from the last year and a half of what, um, what the price
[00:20:32] of homes were when, um, when they closed at certain mortgage rates.
[00:20:38] And we had, we had a mortgage rate ascent.
[00:20:41] I mean, in the last two years, we had a section, a couple of months where mortgage rates
[00:20:46] were between two and a half and three percent and a couple of months between three and three
[00:20:50] and a half and so on and so on and so on.
[00:20:52] You can look back to each of those sections and look at the median prices of homes that
[00:20:58] are closing in your markets.
[00:21:00] And then you can use those, those prices and adjust for inflation and you can say, okay,
[00:21:06] here in today's dollars, here's where these homes were closing.
[00:21:11] If, then, then you have data, you are armed with data to go to your consumers and say, listen,
[00:21:18] this is what we can expect.
[00:21:20] If mortgage rates hit this amount, this is where the median price is going to be and you're
[00:21:24] going to have an incredible amount of competition here.
[00:21:26] Is this where you want to be as a buyer?
[00:21:29] What's the perfect window for you?
[00:21:32] What is, what is the, what is going to serve you best?
[00:21:35] And if you are servicing seller clients, you can tell folks right now like where is based
[00:21:42] on based on what we expect, the trajectory of this market to be, what's going to be the price?
[00:21:47] It's going to get you to your goals because ultimately right now, servicing sellers is not
[00:21:52] about selling their house.
[00:21:54] It is that, that is a relative conclusion based on the, the constriction of inventory.
[00:22:02] Servicing sellers is all about finding them their next place.
[00:22:05] If you can unlock that key, if you essentially treat your sellers as buyers, because that's
[00:22:10] what they are right now, then you, you unlock more inventory for the market.
[00:22:17] So take that advice, use that line.
[00:22:21] We don't have an inventory problem.
[00:22:23] We have a mortgage problem.
[00:22:24] That is something that we need to solve and start talking through strategy.
[00:22:28] You're going to get more people leaning forward into your conversations than sitting back and
[00:22:33] being passive.
[00:22:35] I also think too, I talk to a lot of top luxury agents who get these massive listings for,
[00:22:41] let's say, five million and above.
[00:22:44] These just incredibly high net worth individuals who are playing at this top 1% level of income
[00:22:51] and just wealth.
[00:22:55] What's interesting, and again, as a non-practicing agent, I didn't know this until somebody told me
[00:23:01] years ago, but that when you sell a ex, you know, a million dollar home, one of the challenges
[00:23:10] is actually finding the buyer.
[00:23:13] Actually, listing it on the MLS is oftentimes not that, not as successful as actually reaching
[00:23:21] out to people who can afford those kind of homes directly and saying, hey, I've got this new
[00:23:26] listing, reaching out to agents who have worked in those same price points and saying, what buyers
[00:23:31] do you know?
[00:23:32] I've got this listing.
[00:23:33] You need to come see it.
[00:23:34] And I'm almost wondering if we'll start to see a shift for even on the non-luxury side listing
[00:23:40] agents starting to reach out to homeowners who do not have their listing on the market and saying,
[00:23:46] I'm in the process of selling so and so's home, they need a new place.
[00:23:50] And, you know, it's kind of similar to what real estate investors have done for years, where they
[00:23:55] just send postcards to these multifamily homes going, hey, if you're the owner, I'd like to buy
[00:24:00] your property and they just kind of hope that somebody reaches back out. I'm curious if we'll
[00:24:04] start to see more of that this year.
[00:24:06] Yeah, I am too. I mean, it's like in again, in some of the weirdest ways, it feels like 2024 is going
[00:24:15] to be a cycle of a lot of the things that we don't do anymore that maybe we're going to start doing
[00:24:22] again and will it actually be effective? Will we actually be able to test the effectiveness of
[00:24:26] these strategies? I mean, ultimately, what it really comes down to is there's always going to be
[00:24:32] changes in every market, including real estate. You know, we're a cyclical business. If we never
[00:24:39] cycled, we would have a fundamentally unhealthy market that was based, you know, that is propped up
[00:24:47] on artificial things. We should cycle every market cycles. Ultimately, though,
[00:24:54] what is going to separate the real performers from the pretenders as real estate professionals are
[00:25:02] the ones who can anticipate the cycles and get ahead of, you know, kind of run to where the ball
[00:25:08] is going to be instead of just always chasing after the ball. Yeah, and I think this, we were talking
[00:25:15] about this offline about really figuring out since going back to mortgages being or the housing
[00:25:23] market having a mortgage problem this year, really thinking about creative ways to appease or
[00:25:29] solve for that. And there are, there are creative solutions. There's all sorts of, you know, solutions.
[00:25:36] And this would be, I think, a great time to really reach out to those top loan officers in your
[00:25:41] local market and say, hey, let's let's brainstorm here. You know, what, what ammo can I come with
[00:25:47] to convince a seller that it's a good time to list and how can we appeal most successfully to
[00:25:53] buyers? And does this seller help in that? And we know that, you know, two one buy downs, for example,
[00:25:59] are a pretty common alternative right now to incentivize buyers to get off the sidelines.
[00:26:08] Any, what other suggestions do you have for agents who are just sort of unclear about what to do
[00:26:13] right now? Well, I mean, ultimately, the most successful agents, especially when we're trying to
[00:26:24] solve financing problems, the most successful agents are the ones who are going to do two things
[00:26:31] better than their competitors. The first is they are going to leverage the best connections in
[00:26:38] their market to professionals who do things that they cannot do. So like, there is a limited amount.
[00:26:44] It's not, it's not zero, but there's a limited amount of value that you can provide to your clients
[00:26:51] when they have mortgage specific questions. You can definitely provide a 30,000 foot view, maybe
[00:27:01] options of the strategy and the way to apply those different options. But at the end of the day,
[00:27:08] your advice can only extend so far because you don't have the ability to exercise and actually
[00:27:16] put into action some of those financial instruments that will get your clients across the finish line.
[00:27:24] So there's a, I think 2024 is going to be a year where your connections to really savvy and
[00:27:32] thoughtful mortgage brokers of all stripes, ones that conduct FHA and RD loans, ones that specialize
[00:27:40] in jumbo or luxury loans, ones that optimize for speed. I guarantee you there will be somebody in your
[00:27:51] 2024 real estate world who's going to need a mortgage in eight days. I mean, it's just there is
[00:27:57] going to be a client. We're just, we're just going to see that kind of volatility in the market.
[00:28:01] If you've got a mortgage person who can optimize for speed, you are going to be a winner. So these are,
[00:28:08] these are the like kind of the base level, but there's this whole other element too, especially for
[00:28:14] folks who are not going to necessarily be perfectly serviced by the mortgage industry,
[00:28:21] primarily because the interest rates are not where they need to be. If you have financial
[00:28:26] advisors who can generate ideas on how to use existing wealth, how to create loans from perhaps
[00:28:36] existing assets. If you have financial managers who can, you know, if you are somebody who is
[00:28:43] fortunate enough to have like retirement savings or investment accounts that you don't have to
[00:28:51] liquidate, but you can borrow against. This is something I'm seeing begin to rise in the mortgage
[00:28:57] space or in replacement of mortgages as people borrowing against investment accounts. Because
[00:29:04] the loans are processed differently. The interest rates are different and it still frees people up
[00:29:10] to keep that money invested. They're just borrowing against that money. The agents, if you are
[00:29:16] struggling with answering some of these questions, get connected with the people in your market who
[00:29:22] answer these questions in other contexts. Because these are going to be your best friends for generating
[00:29:29] transactions. Because ultimately, unless you've got a mortgage license and work for a bank,
[00:29:33] there's only so much advice that you can give. So connect with the people who actually can
[00:29:37] actualize that advice. So we're talking about accountants. We're talking about financial advisors,
[00:29:44] a CP, financial planners, also a state planning attorneys. We're really talking about this would be
[00:29:51] a great time to reach out to some of these professionals and say, hey, I want to give my clients
[00:29:57] the best possible opportunities this year for, you know, moving and, you know, we need to
[00:30:02] I would love to explore some any creative ideas you have based on different levels of wealth or
[00:30:08] net worth. There's all sorts of solutions. Let me give you one other kind of alternative. A lot
[00:30:16] of people don't think of this. But if you have clients who are looking to buy in HOA dominated
[00:30:26] buildings or neighborhoods or co-ops, I can tell you from personal experience because I'm on the
[00:30:33] HOA of my neighborhood. That is a that is a thankless job, Chris. We appreciate on behalf of your
[00:30:41] association, we appreciate your service. Some of us got to keep the roads plowed and I'm not driving
[00:30:45] the plow. So I'll help write the checks. Sorry, I just had to I had to appreciate you because I know
[00:30:51] nobody else does. Well, honestly, DJ, it means a lot coming from you. Thank you. No, but this is
[00:30:58] an underutilized resource. But most HOAs that were formed after 2008 require new residents to
[00:31:11] include in their to include in their initiation into the neighborhood, their financing information.
[00:31:20] And though there are different, you know, effort every HOA has their own rules, most HOAs require
[00:31:28] the specific information around the details of individual residents to remain confidential.
[00:31:37] But there is nothing in most bylaws that say that HOA reps can't talk about these things in
[00:31:45] aggregate. So for instance, if you're looking to get into a neighborhood, like if you've got a
[00:31:50] client who's looking to get into a neighborhood and you're struggling with how to solve the financing
[00:31:55] problem, go to the HOA board and say, listen, we're trying to solve the financing here. We want to
[00:32:01] make an offer. We want to live here. How have other people paid to get in here? Totally. And they can
[00:32:08] tell you in fact, most of them, they have a vested interest in you buying in there because they want
[00:32:14] to fill their slots. They want to they want to make sure that the HOA is solvent. So they can say, well,
[00:32:20] 50% of people bought with cash, 50% of people bought with a conventional mortgage, 20% of people
[00:32:28] bought with maybe with a loan from a stock portfolio, 5% of people were land contract. You know,
[00:32:39] whatever it is, I don't know, I don't know the specifics, but go to these HOAs, they have all
[00:32:44] this information. They can tell you, this is a specially valuable in major urban centers where you
[00:32:50] have buildings that have hundreds of units. I mean, they can tell you like in the last 10 years,
[00:32:56] the percentage of people that bought and cash were X. I mean, it is is that information is available.
[00:33:02] They want you to have it because they want you to buy in there. So they're not going to tell you
[00:33:06] that the guy in 2J bought in cash, but they can tell you X percentage of transactions that
[00:33:15] occurred in the last 10 years have been in cash or have been in traditional mortgages. So there are
[00:33:23] there are means to get this information. You just have to figure out who is actualizing that
[00:33:29] information and go right to the source. I love that. Well, I think that's a great place to wrap up.
[00:33:34] For those of us that have HOA opportunities, reach out to the HOA and say, hey, we would love to
[00:33:42] know what creative solutions people have used to secure their transaction. How have people done
[00:33:51] this? Are there any lenders that you've seen time and time again come through the HOA that people
[00:33:56] seem to be satisfied with in maybe a unique way? This happened in my own building when we were
[00:34:03] buying there was one lender who just seemed to get things done in a really super creative way that
[00:34:10] other lenders couldn't and it happened among a lot of the people who were buying. We were all
[00:34:16] chatting with each other, which was very unusual. But we were all talking about it because we were
[00:34:20] all experiencing this one issue. And somebody says, oh, I've got the person. And we all kind of went
[00:34:24] to that person. And there's, you know, that person got a lot of business, but it was because they
[00:34:28] had a creative solution. So yeah, I think that's a wonderful idea. Well, Chris, I think this is a great
[00:34:32] place to sort of wrap up for today. I know we could keep talking and I know there's a lot more.
[00:34:37] I certainly want to talk about, and I know this is near and dear to your heart in our next conversation,
[00:34:43] about sort of vulnerability with data, cyber attack stuff. We know MLS has been compromised. And
[00:34:52] we know that that also the, you know, the real estate industry, at least the National Association of
[00:35:01] REALTORS and everything underneath it has struggled to keep up with tech. And so we know there's a lot
[00:35:07] of vulnerability there that we should probably talk about and how agents can sort of prepare for some,
[00:35:13] you know, some of that disruption because it is already, it has already happened. But yeah, we will,
[00:35:19] we will keep that for our next conversation along with anything else. By the way, please follow Chris
[00:35:24] on LinkedIn and anywhere else that he is posting on social. We will have links because he posts a
[00:35:31] lot of these unpopular opinions. And if you disagree and you have a differing viewpoint,

And I would also just really quickly like to say thank you to our audience. I got a very nice holiday gift. I try not to bog myself down in the metrics of our show. However, we did have our very biggest month ever, which I didn't even know. I don't ever look at December numbers because they were always the lowest of the year. But my marketing person shared our statistics just the other day with me for December. I was like, don't show me and he goes, no, you want to see these? And they were actually up. So thanks in part to Chris. Chris has actually been part of our show for years. And we have a new feature for him now, which was very exciting, called unpopular real estate opinions. So we, this is our second episode in this series. We'll be doing this monthly. Chris, let's jump right into it. What's, what's unpopular right now in your mind? Oh, man. Well, DJ, again, thanks for having me back. I love that every, every time we get together now, I get to bring some of the topics that I talk about with people on social and in person. And I'm just kind of earmarking all the ones that people yell at me the most about so that I can share them with you because just because people don't like it doesn't mean it ain't true. So I've got a few unpopular opinions that maybe we should chat about. The first is, and you know, take this with a grain of salt here. But the first is, 2024 is going to be a terrible year for real estate until it's not. And I know that sounds like a really weird way of saying it. But basically, what I'm trying to get at here is that the beginning of 2024 is going to be challenging. We've got a lot of people who are prognosticating that 2024, the new year, it's going to be a brand new leaf. I don't think so, man. I think that the first half of 2024 is still going to be very challenging for a number of reasons. But the second half of 2024 is likely to be one of the busiest times in real estate that we've seen in a long time, a certain, certainly compared to the first half of the year. So for agents who are looking to do some forecasting for themselves on this year, I would be forecasting pretty lean until about June. And then get your roller skate song, because that's the only way you're going to be able to get to and from fast enough to serve us all the clients that you're going to have. Yeah. And I think, I think you're right. So it really will be sort of this diametrically opposed in your mind, sort of halves of the year. So we'll have the have-nots maybe in the first half of the year due to market constriction. We've got high interest rates. We have low inventory. We just have less activity. Quite. Yeah. And you know, here's the reason why this tends to be kind of a flashpoint issue for folks is ultimately some of the reasons why I think 2024, the second half is going to accelerate. And not necessarily for the better of our clients, honestly, is we have in 2023 experienced this incredible constriction of the market just in general. I mean, it was just it was a hard time to buy and sell a home in the United States. And I'll even say hard time to sell a home, even though homes are fetching record prices, it's just a difficult time to sell because the markets feel so uncertain at the moment. And that's making sellers nervous. We've just we experienced some record constriction in 2023 and 2024 is going to be the year where all of the pent up demand that occurred through 2023 and frankly still some leftover pent up demand in COVID, that's going to kind of break loose. And that's going to be really exciting and interesting. But the reason why this is kind of an unpopular conversation topic is I don't think this is necessarily to the benefit of our clients because we're going to go from having quiet challenging markets to extraordinarily hot and competitive markets. We're going to see whiplash amongst our buyers very, very quickly. Sellers with unrealistic timelines. And then you're going to layer in on top of all of that these lawsuits faced by NAR that are going to create a whole new level of uncertainty around commissions, which is not something that was a part of the conversation from COVID through 2023. I guess the second half of 2023, but it's going to be a busy year in real estate real estate professionals need to keep their head on straight. If they actually want to translate that busyness into benefit for their clients, do you believe that that in the upcoming, let's say 24 next 24 months that there will be any reform to buyer side commissions? Great question. Where are they going to have to come to the table with cash? Is it going to be built into their mortgage if they have one or is it still going to be all technically sourced by the seller and just maybe more transparently split? Great question. Here's a couple of things that I am confident it will not be. I'm confident it will not be built into a mortgage. The reason behind that is 99%, maybe 98 and a half percent of mortgages in the United States have particular stipulations that regulate that only real property can be used as a, this tool can only be used to finance real property. Though there are certain percentage level exceptions to that, that conveniently get applied by the banks and not by outside sources, you can actually roll in your closing costs in some loans into the mortgageable amount. Banks are happy to charge you interest on that stuff. But the other fees and costs associated with real estate, I think will be a very challenging hill to climb as far as rolling them into mortgages. To your specific question about whether or not I think we'll see any reform, the answer is yes, but I think the reform will occur on the level of professional bodies. I don't see the United States as a governmental body passing any kind of mortgage reform in the next 24 months. That may be a commentary on the state of politics in the United States, but just generally speaking that seems like a no-win issue because you have particular interests on the part of consumers that happen to also kind of come up at odds with the interests of one of the largest professional advocacy groups in the entire country, almost the world in NAR. So I don't think there will be any kind of movement from a legal perspective there, but I do think NAR will likely install some new internal professional regulations, but they are just going to be tweaks to the existing laws, regs, which basically says you can offer optionally to pay a buyer's agent. It is not an assumed requirement like it is now basically which is what got NAR in trouble before. It's going to become optional. You can choose whether or not you want to offer a buyer's side and that just will become more explicit. What does that actually change pretty damn close to nothing, frankly? I think we are going to, and again, unpopularly, I understand this is going to be to the detriment of our consumers and the detriment of us professionally because it's just going to extend the quagmire through which we have to wade through on this issue. 2024 is going to be a year where we have to explain to every single client why that lawsuit happened, what the results were and what it means to them. The real sticky wicket clients are going to be insisting that things change even though they don't even know what they want them to change to other than they just want to pay less. This is going to be a year where we should start rehearsing that conversation because again, first half of the year it's going to be pretty quiet. The second half of the year there's going to be an incredible amount of activity so you're going to be having this conversation on a regular basis with people. So if we do assume that the second half of the year quarter is three and four are going to be more active, more buyers, certainly as rates decline, which we hope happens and seems to be what the economists are predicting. Would you recommend as an agent today to really encourage the both sides buyer and seller or just one or neither to participate in the market before it gets flooded with competition? Oh, big time. 100%. In fact, the real like the purchasing power of dollars is going to be, I'm sorry, let me rephrase that. The purchasing power of buyers is going to be measurably higher in the first half of the year. And the reason behind this is, you know, Lawrence, you know, from from NAR chief economist from NAR has has publicly predicted that he expects to see interest rates. Hold steady for the first quarter or third of the year and then start to trickle down. That start that when we see mortgage rates trickle down, I am willing to bet, I'm willing to bet the backyard on the fact that when we see four weeks in a row of trickle down mortgage rates, we're going to see an increase out of out of that a disproportionately large increase in buyer activity. So the reduction in mortgage rates are going to be offset by this buyer activity. And it's going to make it harder and more expensive at the end of the day to buy a house because even though that rate is going to go down, the competition is going to go up by disproportionate percentage. So if you have clients who are waiting on the sidelines right now saying, well, I'm not, I'm ready to buy a house, but I'm not going to buy it until I have a mortgage rate that, you know, starts with 6.2. Uh, these are people who, uh, the banks are just salivating over because yeah, they might get a 6.2% mortgage rate, but the purchase price in their home isn't going to be $410,000 or whatever the median price is right now. It's going to be $460,000. So they're going to make more money. The banks will make more money at lower rates if we see that trickled that slow trickle down. Um, 2024 is going to be a challenging year, um, to get the timing right. And whenever I say, uh, whenever I'm talking to people about how, uh, to effectively service the real estate clients, when it comes to market timing, I always tell them, if you have a client who thinks that they're going to time the market, this is somebody that you should refer because this is somebody who will waste your time. And when it is actually time, when they actually feel like they're activated, they will never be satisfied because the window for their success is non-existent despite what they actually say. Yeah, it's just, it's a very strong point. Um, yes. And that, that being said, as an agent today, what would be, I think, really beneficial is that REALTORS start proactively contacting clients and having these conversations and having this explanation of, here's why it might make sense to list today or to get into the buyer side, um, you know, and talking about there are creative financing solutions. I know we wanted to get into some, some solutions to help, uh, help buyers a little bit more when it illustrates our high, but also, um, just having the conversation of it, it's very similar to having the, the buy low sell high conversation when, when, you know, we're talking about securities and financial advisors, um, you know, if they're, if they're worth their assault, they, uh, you know, once a stock is up, significantly, it's not the time to purchase traditionally. Uh, so, but, but psychologically, it feels like the time to buy because things are looking good, um, in the, in the stock market. So we, we know that logically, but emotionally, that's sort of the hurdle people have to get over. And I think the emotional hurdle gets extinguished or, or gets cleared, uh, very easily with logic. But I think it has, it information, it has to be communicated. And that's not necessarily the message that I'm seeing a lot on, uh, in, in the media right now. I'm seeing a lot of, um, yeah, talk about mortgage rates. I'm not seeing a lot of talk about whether it's actually a good time to purchase and what the logic behind that is, uh, or to sell. And, and I think this is where a REALTOR can really earn their stripes by reaching out to their clients and saying, Hey, here's what really is not being talked about. And if you have data to back it up, even better to say, you know, let's go back a couple of years when rates were below 4%. And let's take a look at what the average prices of homes you might be looking at purchasing. Let's see what they closed for. Let's see what they listed for and let's see what they closed for. And let's remember what the, what those times were. If you were an agent back then, if not, the data is there. You can go back and look and you will, you will, you know, we, we can all shutter from, from a little bit of those times about how difficult it was to just do much of anything. If you're on the buy side, 100%. In fact, any agents, I'm going to give, I'm going to give anybody who's listening. If you are feeling motivated by DJs, um, golden words of wisdom, which you also feel motivated by here. Um, if you are, are, if you just made a mental note, um, that you need to start talking to your clients about opportunities relative to kind of the expected timing of this market, I'm going to give you some ammunition here. Um, and this is actually, again, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to use an unpopular opinion here. Everyone who's listening to this, take it, steal this, put this in your quiver as a provocative topic to get a conversation started real estate in 2024 is not going to have an inventory problem. It's going to have a mortgage problem. And what I mean by that is, yeah, it's true that we don't have enough, enough inventory to service the needs of the buyers, but the root of the inventory problem is mortgage rates. And, um, we were talking earlier, remind me what you said, what, what percentage of, of homeowners in the United States currently have a mortgage rate less than 5%, 85% 85. I mean, that's insane. 85 out of every 100 homeowners have a mortgage rate of less than 5%. And I would venture to guess, I don't have the numbers in front of me. Excuse me, but I would venture to guess there's a sizeable percentage of people with a mortgage rate of less than 4% right now. And so this is a choke point in the inventory cycle that is going to create havoc for, um, for inventory issues. And again, it is, this is a mortgage problem. If you are, if you want to take DJ's advice and start having these conversations open with that line, we don't have an inventory, we have problem, we have a mortgage problem. And then you can, you can stretch out DJ's suggestions around the sorts of things that you should do to facilitate that conversation. Take it a step further. We have data from just, I mean, from the last year and a half of what, um, what the price of homes were when, um, when they closed at certain mortgage rates. And we had, we had a mortgage rate ascent. I mean, in the last two years, we had a section, a couple of months where mortgage rates were between two and a half and three percent and a couple of months between three and three and a half and so on and so on and so on. You can look back to each of those sections and look at the median prices of homes that are closing in your markets. And then you can use those, those prices and adjust for inflation and you can say, okay, here in today's dollars, here's where these homes were closing. If, then, then you have data, you are armed with data to go to your consumers and say, listen, this is what we can expect. If mortgage rates hit this amount, this is where the median price is going to be and you're going to have an incredible amount of competition here. Is this where you want to be as a buyer? What's the perfect window for you? What is, what is the, what is going to serve you best? And if you are servicing seller clients, you can tell folks right now like where is based on based on what we expect, the trajectory of this market to be, what's going to be the price? It's going to get you to your goals because ultimately right now, servicing sellers is not about selling their house. It is that, that is a relative conclusion based on the, the constriction of inventory. Servicing sellers is all about finding them their next place. If you can unlock that key, if you essentially treat your sellers as buyers, because that's what they are right now, then you, you unlock more inventory for the market. So take that advice, use that line. We don't have an inventory problem. We have a mortgage problem. That is something that we need to solve and start talking through strategy. You're going to get more people leaning forward into your conversations than sitting back and being passive. I also think too, I talk to a lot of top luxury agents who get these massive listings for, let's say, five million and above. These just incredibly high net worth individuals who are playing at this top 1% level of income and just wealth. What's interesting, and again, as a non-practicing agent, I didn't know this until somebody told me years ago, but that when you sell a ex, you know, a million dollar home, one of the challenges is actually finding the buyer. Actually, listing it on the MLS is oftentimes not that, not as successful as actually reaching out to people who can afford those kind of homes directly and saying, hey, I've got this new listing, reaching out to agents who have worked in those same price points and saying, what buyers do you know? I've got this listing. You need to come see it. And I'm almost wondering if we'll start to see a shift for even on the non-luxury side listing agents starting to reach out to homeowners who do not have their listing on the market and saying, I'm in the process of selling so and so's home, they need a new place. And, you know, it's kind of similar to what real estate investors have done for years, where they just send postcards to these multifamily homes going, hey, if you're the owner, I'd like to buy your property and they just kind of hope that somebody reaches back out. I'm curious if we'll start to see more of that this year. Yeah, I am too. I mean, it's like in again, in some of the weirdest ways, it feels like 2024 is going to be a cycle of a lot of the things that we don't do anymore that maybe we're going to start doing again and will it actually be effective? Will we actually be able to test the effectiveness of these strategies? I mean, ultimately, what it really comes down to is there's always going to be changes in every market, including real estate. You know, we're a cyclical business. If we never cycled, we would have a fundamentally unhealthy market that was based, you know, that is propped up on artificial things. We should cycle every market cycles. Ultimately, though, what is going to separate the real performers from the pretenders as real estate professionals are the ones who can anticipate the cycles and get ahead of, you know, kind of run to where the ball is going to be instead of just always chasing after the ball. Yeah, and I think this, we were talking about this offline about really figuring out since going back to mortgages being or the housing market having a mortgage problem this year, really thinking about creative ways to appease or solve for that. And there are, there are creative solutions. There's all sorts of, you know, solutions. And this would be, I think, a great time to really reach out to those top loan officers in your local market and say, hey, let's let's brainstorm here. You know, what, what ammo can I come with to convince a seller that it's a good time to list and how can we appeal most successfully to buyers? And does this seller help in that? And we know that, you know, two one buy downs, for example, are a pretty common alternative right now to incentivize buyers to get off the sidelines. Any, what other suggestions do you have for agents who are just sort of unclear about what to do right now? Well, I mean, ultimately, the most successful agents, especially when we're trying to solve financing problems, the most successful agents are the ones who are going to do two things better than their competitors. The first is they are going to leverage the best connections in their market to professionals who do things that they cannot do. So like, there is a limited amount. It's not, it's not zero, but there's a limited amount of value that you can provide to your clients when they have mortgage specific questions. You can definitely provide a 30,000 foot view, maybe options of the strategy and the way to apply those different options. But at the end of the day, your advice can only extend so far because you don't have the ability to exercise and actually put into action some of those financial instruments that will get your clients across the finish line. So there's a, I think 2024 is going to be a year where your connections to really savvy and thoughtful mortgage brokers of all stripes, ones that conduct FHA and RD loans, ones that specialize in jumbo or luxury loans, ones that optimize for speed. I guarantee you there will be somebody in your 2024 real estate world who's going to need a mortgage in eight days. I mean, it's just there is going to be a client. We're just, we're just going to see that kind of volatility in the market. If you've got a mortgage person who can optimize for speed, you are going to be a winner. So these are, these are the like kind of the base level, but there's this whole other element too, especially for folks who are not going to necessarily be perfectly serviced by the mortgage industry, primarily because the interest rates are not where they need to be. If you have financial advisors who can generate ideas on how to use existing wealth, how to create loans from perhaps existing assets. If you have financial managers who can, you know, if you are somebody who is fortunate enough to have like retirement savings or investment accounts that you don't have to liquidate, but you can borrow against. This is something I'm seeing begin to rise in the mortgage space or in replacement of mortgages as people borrowing against investment accounts. Because the loans are processed differently. The interest rates are different and it still frees people up to keep that money invested. They're just borrowing against that money. The agents, if you are struggling with answering some of these questions, get connected with the people in your market who answer these questions in other contexts. Because these are going to be your best friends for generating transactions. Because ultimately, unless you've got a mortgage license and work for a bank, there's only so much advice that you can give. So connect with the people who actually can actualize that advice. So we're talking about accountants. We're talking about financial advisors, a CP, financial planners, also a state planning attorneys. We're really talking about this would be a great time to reach out to some of these professionals and say, hey, I want to give my clients the best possible opportunities this year for, you know, moving and, you know, we need to I would love to explore some any creative ideas you have based on different levels of wealth or net worth. There's all sorts of solutions. Let me give you one other kind of alternative. A lot of people don't think of this. But if you have clients who are looking to buy in HOA dominated buildings or neighborhoods or co-ops, I can tell you from personal experience because I'm on the HOA of my neighborhood. That is a that is a thankless job, Chris. We appreciate on behalf of your association, we appreciate your service. Some of us got to keep the roads plowed and I'm not driving the plow. So I'll help write the checks. Sorry, I just had to I had to appreciate you because I know nobody else does. Well, honestly, DJ, it means a lot coming from you. Thank you. No, but this is an underutilized resource. But most HOAs that were formed after 2008 require new residents to include in their to include in their initiation into the neighborhood, their financing information. And though there are different, you know, effort every HOA has their own rules, most HOAs require the specific information around the details of individual residents to remain confidential. But there is nothing in most bylaws that say that HOA reps can't talk about these things in aggregate. So for instance, if you're looking to get into a neighborhood, like if you've got a client who's looking to get into a neighborhood and you're struggling with how to solve the financing problem, go to the HOA board and say, listen, we're trying to solve the financing here. We want to make an offer. We want to live here. How have other people paid to get in here? Totally. And they can tell you in fact, most of them, they have a vested interest in you buying in there because they want to fill their slots. They want to they want to make sure that the HOA is solvent. So they can say, well, 50% of people bought with cash, 50% of people bought with a conventional mortgage, 20% of people bought with maybe with a loan from a stock portfolio, 5% of people were land contract. You know, whatever it is, I don't know, I don't know the specifics, but go to these HOAs, they have all this information. They can tell you, this is a specially valuable in major urban centers where you have buildings that have hundreds of units. I mean, they can tell you like in the last 10 years, the percentage of people that bought and cash were X. I mean, it is is that information is available. They want you to have it because they want you to buy in there. So they're not going to tell you that the guy in 2J bought in cash, but they can tell you X percentage of transactions that occurred in the last 10 years have been in cash or have been in traditional mortgages. So there are there are means to get this information. You just have to figure out who is actualizing that information and go right to the source. I love that. Well, I think that's a great place to wrap up. For those of us that have HOA opportunities, reach out to the HOA and say, hey, we would love to know what creative solutions people have used to secure their transaction. How have people done this? Are there any lenders that you've seen time and time again come through the HOA that people seem to be satisfied with in maybe a unique way? This happened in my own building when we were buying there was one lender who just seemed to get things done in a really super creative way that other lenders couldn't and it happened among a lot of the people who were buying. We were all chatting with each other, which was very unusual. But we were all talking about it because we were all experiencing this one issue. And somebody says, oh, I've got the person. And we all kind of went to that person. And there's, you know, that person got a lot of business, but it was because they had a creative solution. So yeah, I think that's a wonderful idea. Well, Chris, I think this is a great place to sort of wrap up for today. I know we could keep talking and I know there's a lot more. I certainly want to talk about, and I know this is near and dear to your heart in our next conversation, about sort of vulnerability with data, cyber attack stuff. We know MLS has been compromised. And we know that that also the, you know, the real estate industry, at least the National Association of REALTORS and everything underneath it has struggled to keep up with tech. And so we know there's a lot of vulnerability there that we should probably talk about and how agents can sort of prepare for some, you know, some of that disruption because it is already, it has already happened. But yeah, we will, we will keep that for our next conversation along with anything else. By the way, please follow Chris on LinkedIn and anywhere else that he is posting on social.
