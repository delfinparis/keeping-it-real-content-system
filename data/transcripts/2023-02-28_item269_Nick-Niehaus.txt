[00:03:46] Nick, welcome to the show.
[00:03:48] Yeah, thanks DJ. Thanks for having me on.
[00:03:50] Very excited to chat with you.
[00:03:54] You know, the world's really changed a lot.
[00:03:56] Well, the world's always changing, but certainly with the advent three years ago,
[00:04:01] you know, with when COVID hit and we were doing work from home,
[00:04:05] I saw a shift in REALTORS really probably more at a desperation than anything,
[00:04:13] but just embracing some of the video,
[00:04:16] conferencing technology, you know, more video production when it comes to social media.
[00:04:23] And I've seen agents continue to evolve their video practices,
[00:04:28] even now we're largely back to normal and we're moving around and about of course.
[00:04:33] I'm still seeing that trend continue.
[00:04:35] Obviously the rise of TikTok has also increased the popularity of video.
[00:04:41] But I am so excited to have you on the show because I want to talk all things video.
[00:04:47] You know, this is something that I think every one of our listeners or viewers can relate to
[00:04:53] and try to figure out as they determine what they want to spend their time and energy on in 2023.
[00:05:00] I think video is a great skill that really anyone can develop and obviously you teach people how to do that.
[00:05:08] So excited to have you on.
[00:05:11] Awesome. Yeah. Now I love talking about this of it.
[00:05:13] It's the pandemic certainly sort of accelerated and disrupted all kinds of stuff with videos.
[00:05:19] So it's been an interesting three years.
[00:05:21] Well, let's let's talk about the role of video.
[00:05:25] So first, well, let's get into your background before we actually start giving suggestions to agents.
[00:05:30] So what brought you into into this space?
[00:05:33] Yeah. So I mean, I've been so I actually, you know, when I went to college, I started working as a freshman for a company called college works painting.
[00:05:41] I ended up working there for six years.
[00:05:43] And in that experience, like you basically you run a small painting business, kind of like an internship program.
[00:05:48] And so that was my first experience with with marketing, which I'll sort of put quotes around because there was a lot of door knocking.
[00:05:54] Just going out knocking on doors, putting flyers out, you know, all that stuff.
[00:05:58] And, you know, it's going going to waste back at this point.
[00:06:01] But the reason I bring that up is because I basically have been working and marketing ever since.
[00:06:05] And so it's something that I've been good at in some areas, you know, really bad at in others.
[00:06:10] What happened though is I actually started a company.
[00:06:13] Man, it's been almost eight years, I think, at this point.
[00:06:16] And what we did is we would put out flyers for other businesses, right?
[00:06:19] So we got working with real estate agencies as a result of that because of the concept of farming.
[00:06:23] We had this cool sticky flyer. You could like stick right in the middle of a front door.
[00:06:27] Very, you know, I got kind of catching.
[00:06:30] And so we started working with them and started doing this farming stuff.
[00:06:33] And that was probably about six years ago.
[00:06:35] And I was right when video was really starting to emerge as a marketing tool for small businesses.
[00:06:40] And so there was kind of this big, this big, cut of moment in time where, you know, you can start to run your own Facebook video ads.
[00:06:46] You can start to run YouTube ads.
[00:06:48] And very few small businesses were even kind of aware of these possibilities.
[00:06:53] And so we kind of went to these agents who you're working with too, and these flyers.
[00:06:57] And part of it was we didn't want to be out there, you know, putting flyers on doors for the rest of our lives.
[00:07:01] Or like, what could we do that's a little bit more sustainable?
[00:07:04] And so we started making videos with them and, you know, bringing them into our studio and coaching them on camera.
[00:07:09] And, you know, a lot of it ended up being sort of psychological stuff, you know, getting over that fear of the camera,
[00:07:14] getting over their, you know, quams about seeing themselves on that video screen.
[00:07:18] And then three years ago, right around the beginning of the pandemic, actually a little before that,
[00:07:23] we started to realize, you know, hey, these people are coming, we're making a video with them.
[00:07:27] You think this would kickstart this sort of brand effort.
[00:07:30] Hey, I'm going to use video everywhere. I'm going to start, you know, sending my clients video messages.
[00:07:34] I'm starting making social media videos, you know, and it wasn't happening, you know.
[00:07:37] And that's what kind of led us to saying, well, there's a gap here.
[00:07:40] You know, there's something people are missing or they're misunderstanding.
[00:07:43] You know, how to use video is at the technical steps and the more research we did, it was sort of all of it, you know,
[00:07:49] and we said, okay, well, we need to build a training program for this.
[00:07:52] We need to start teaching people how to use this new form of communication, which is the way that we saw it.
[00:07:57] And so timing, it worked out perfect because we actually, we built a course and piloted it.
[00:08:02] We launched that December of 2019.
[00:08:05] And so like within three months, the pandemic swept the country and, I mean, literally we got shut down.
[00:08:10] We weren't allowed to make videos of people for a couple months.
[00:08:13] And that was a forced pivot, obviously, but we sort of immediately said, all right, let's start doing this training.
[00:08:18] We got this course. Let's see what we can do. We brought some partners in.
[00:08:21] And I think we had 900 people come through that first course within about three months, you know.
[00:08:26] So it's like, okay, there's clearly clearly a need for what we're doing here.
[00:08:29] And we've just been kind of running ever since.
[00:08:32] I, that's amazing.
[00:08:33] I remember back really before video was so prevalent in social media in particular, when you would go to do anything in the video, they would typically ask you, have you been media trained, right?
[00:08:50] That was that was the old, the old sort of skill set that have you been, you've been in front of a camera before.
[00:08:56] This is really before we all just had, you know, high definition cameras in our pockets that could, you know, take almost comparable shots with, you know, with these $20,000 cameras.
[00:09:10] And so it used to be a thing where you were like, no, you really do need to get trained.
[00:09:14] You need to know what to say and whatnot to say. And you still do need to get trained.
[00:09:17] But thankfully the barrier to entry obviously is, you know, your phone, which everyone has.
[00:09:24] And so let's, I think first, what would probably make the most sense for our audience is let's set, let's make the case for video.
[00:09:33] And when we talk about video, let's define what we're talking about.
[00:09:37] Why should REALTORS be focused on video this year?
[00:09:41] Yeah, and I love that question because I think, you know, a lot of folks, they get into tactics or strategy way too fast, you know, a lot of these conversations, they go straight to like, all right, what kind of video should I make?
[00:09:51] And that was one thing that stood out to me when we first started the school and we started looking into, hey, what exists out there is that a lot of the recorded presentations, a lot of the top, you know, stuff people were talking on was just so far down the path in our eyes, you know, it's sort of like, hey, they're skipping a lot of steps here and a wonder people are thinking they should do these things, but they're not taking action because they're overwhelmed, they're confused, you know, it's kind of the byproduct of the way it's being talked about.
[00:10:15] So, so yeah, I think I think it's taking a step back and asking ourselves like, well, what is it? What is video? Right? I mean, so that that's where I started. It's like, in my mind, videos, a form of communication. And I think it's important to see it that way because everything we do to communicate with someone remotely.
[00:10:31] So, if I'm going to send a text and email, it used to be sending letters, we don't do much of that anymore, but you know, letters, all that kind of stuff, it was all kind of created to supplement or sort of replace a face to face conversation.
[00:10:47] So, the only reason we ever do any of these other kinds of communication is because we can't be physically face to face with that other person, right?
[00:10:54] So, if we sort of say, okay, well, ideally I get into the same room, I'm sitting across from the table, we all know that when we're in that context, we're able to build relationships the most effectively, we're able to close deals at the highest rate, all of that stuff is kind of maximized.
[00:11:09] Well, that's what video simulates better than anything else. So, when we compare it to a phone call, all this kind of stuff, the only form of communication we have available that feels as close to a face to face conversation is clearly video, right?
[00:11:24] And that has a ton to do a trust. So, when I can see somebody, I mean, there's actually part of my brains called the fused-of-form gyros that recognizes other people's faces and it stores that information, it tells us, hey, have I seen this person before?
[00:11:37] There's an element of how many times, right? If it's somebody I've seen a bunch, I automatically trust you because my brain says, hey, this must be somebody who's sort of part of my tribe, right? I see them every day or I see them every day.
[00:11:48] They're safe because I see them visually, either in my visual space occasionally.
[00:11:55] Right. And we evolve, I mean, what's interesting is, throughout evolution, we have not evolved to understand really any of these other forms of communication. So, our brains at a fundamental level, when they see a person's face, the only thing that your brain can really understand is that person must be in the room with me.
[00:12:13] So, consciously, we know it's not, but most of our brain is non-conscious, right?
[00:12:18] It sort of...
[00:12:19] It bypasses a little bit of those critical factors of the brain. So, when we see someone, especially, you're so right because it's not even just face, I think, I think when people are taking full-body videos, it's like all of a sudden, we know what their physical being looks like.
[00:12:40] And just like we would with an actor or somebody on television, we feel connected in some small way, consciously or unconsciously, simply because we are brain thinks, you know, that, yeah, you're right, we're in close proximity with them even though we're not.
[00:12:57] Yeah. And that's huge. And it's actually, I emphasize this a lot in our trainings when I talk about how you frame yourself in a video, right?
[00:13:04] So, a lot of folks, like if they send a video to somebody, their head is for some reason in the bottom half of the frame. You've probably seen this where it's like, you know, vertical video and their head's right out of the bottom and they go all space above it, you know, for no reason.
[00:13:17] And a lot of it's just they don't know how to hold the phone or they feel a little uncomfortable about putting their body out there.
[00:13:22] But that takes away from that experience, right?
[00:13:24] So, rather, like, that makes my brain question what's going on. Now, I'm kind of like, well, I think I'm talking to this person, but like, it's just their head floating there, which is kind of weird, right?
[00:13:34] So, yeah, I think the more any kind of video, I mean, this goes for public stuff, it goes for the more intimate one to one video messages, you know, you should try to sort of appear like you would in front of that person if you were sitting across the table, right?
[00:13:48] So, you want to incorporate some of your body, you want to make sure your face is large enough that they can read all your facial expressions.
[00:13:54] You know, you want to be somewhat careful about lighting, but mostly just so they can clearly see your face. Not because you had to look perfect, but you need to make sure they can see you just like they would if they were face to face.
[00:14:03] And if you do that, I mean, that it's a game changer, right? I mean, this is like, I love sending video messages. Like, I love to send people like happy birthday videos 10 seconds long.
[00:14:13] It's such a perfect example of this because then they see me, right? They have that sort of mini experience of having this kind of really quick face to face chat, but they remember it for months.
[00:14:23] I mean, I've had people that I'll send them a birthday video one year and the year later, I miss it. And they're sending me a message like, hey, where's my birthday video?
[00:14:30] You know, because they remember it from a year before, right? So there's all that, there's all that stuff that's going on in the human mind.
[00:14:36] And the reality is once you get used to doing this, a lot of people look at video and they're intimidated and they kind of put it off because of that.
[00:14:42] But once you get used to using, especially video kind of as a one to one or one to just a few people form of communication, it doesn't take any more time.
[00:14:52] Right? So the time it takes to sit in front of the camera and say, hey, let me give you a quick update on the transaction. Here's what's going on.
[00:14:58] In my experience, it's actually faster than typing it out because I'm, you know, I type and I make some mistakes. I got to fix it and you get over think what you're saying.
[00:15:05] Make sure they don't misinterpret what you wrote with a video. You don't have to worry about that. People understand it better.
[00:15:10] We actually comprehend more information when we can watch a person talking versus just reading the text on the screen.
[00:15:16] So they're, I mean, you know, we could sort of create a huge laundry list to sort of all the benefits for it.
[00:15:20] But I think at a fundamental level, it's what you have to remind yourself is, hey, this is, it's not always a performance, right?
[00:15:27] It can be a performance just like you can write a blog post that might get read by thousands of people.
[00:15:32] But we can also send a text or an email, right? And we don't we don't overthink those things. We just do it. It's just part of our day to day experience.
[00:15:39] That's where I think people really need to focus on videos. How, how do you just make it a normal thing you do as part of your day to day communication?
[00:15:47] And if you start there, number one, you see benefits a lot faster. It has an impact immediately.
[00:15:53] And then you also get so much more comfortable on camera. So when it comes, you know, few weeks later, a few months later, when you're getting ready to build that YouTube channel or build that tick-tock,
[00:16:02] you're much more comfortable, you're much more confident on camera, and you just move a lot faster because of that.
[00:16:08] So I think there's, you know, I think a lot of us have sort of mixed that up. We sort of started on the hard end.
[00:16:12] And we need to sort of reset a little bit and come back to the beginning.
[00:16:16] Boy, you just said so much and my brain is spinning a little bit because I was thinking we were going to really pretty much exclusively talk about how to do video better on social media.
[00:16:28] And you said something, and of course, you do teach that. But I am, you said something that really resonated with me today, specifically because it just happened to me just before we started our show.
[00:16:40] So this is so perfect because you were talking about using video for more regular communication.
[00:16:46] So yes, of course, there's a social media sort of strategy there and, and you know, people, REALTORS are always trying to figure out how much of my personal life do I display, do I put on display on my Facebook page and Instagram, etc.
[00:17:01] But you're saying we're really talking about a different thing right now, which I think is really critical because this just happened to me before our show, which was you can send one to one messages to people.
[00:17:13] Because we think about branding and like I'm going to put this out on Facebook, everyone's going to see it. Like you said thousands of people might read a blog post or see a video.
[00:17:20] But then there's also one to one communication. And I just receive I will tell you I, we get pitched by advertisers, guests every single day on our show, a publicist, you know, whoever reach out, you know, hey, book our guest.
[00:17:34] I got it. This has probably happened in five years. I've out of thousands of pitches. I've probably had this happen five times out of thousands, no joke.
[00:17:45] And it was, hey, I made a video for you. I want you to check this out. I didn't know if this was a guest. I didn't know if it was a vendor. I didn't know anything. I didn't know what it was. Could have been a spam message. I had no idea.
[00:17:56] But he's like, hey, DJ or actually wasn't even meant to me. It's for a producer. But there was like, hey, Zana, check this out. And this guy has this company where he does computerized or robotic handwritten, you know, the cards and notes and things.
[00:18:15] Anyway, and he was like, hey, DJ, I want to show this to you. I think there's be a good fit for you show. Now because I watched his 35 second video where he kind of like, I'm like, oh, I know this guy. I instantly like him. And I don't know anything about him. He might be a horrible human being.
[00:18:31] He might be a he might actually not be a good human being. I don't know, but I liked him instantly because he took the time to make a video.
[00:18:41] I can't even explain why I liked him. But there's this unconscious part of the brain that when some when you do see somebody, you have a tendency to want to connect with them.
[00:18:51] And so that there's a visual component that bypasses even logic. Like, I don't know this guy. He's just some dude trying to get on my show, which happens all day long. Why do I really want. And by the way, he's not the only person with this exact kind of business. There's lots of businesses that have these robotic things that handwrite thing.
[00:19:09] So it's not even a unique value proposition. But for some reason, I got so excited that he made me a video. He made me.
[00:19:16] Yeah. Even though it took him probably a minute to do it. It was crazy effective. Had he had just written me and said, hey, I've got this thing. I probably would have been like, and I know.
[00:19:28] Yeah, there's something that lit up my brain automatically, the fact that I got a video message, a one to one video message. And I know that isn't necessarily the purpose of our conversation.
[00:19:41] But it just happened to me. And it really affected it affected the way. And we were like, I'm like, just book him immediately book him.
[00:19:49] Wow. Yeah. No, I mean, I love that actually. I mean, I think realistically, I mean, there's a lot of people talking about how to do video for social media. I mean, you know, because you get there's there's a whole career of influencer, right?
[00:20:02] So there's people out there who's job is to grow following on social media. And I think it's, it's a little bit unfortunate that so many business owners are looking to those people.
[00:20:13] And they're learning about video from them. You know, I mean, they're, then there's, you know, they're not all bad is that it's not a comment that they shouldn't be doing that.
[00:20:20] But it's a distraction. I think that's the real problem, right? Is that there are, you know, I actually put out a sort of small survey on LinkedIn the other day, it says curious.
[00:20:28] It's like, well, hey, remember when email first came out, you know, it's been about 30 years at this point, right?
[00:20:33] But it's like, remember when it first came out, how did you use it initially? Did you send email to a single person at a time? Did you send it to like small groups?
[00:20:40] Or did you blast out, you know, massive newsletters to thousands of people? And obviously every single person said, I sent emails to just one person, right?
[00:20:48] Yeah. And we missed that step with video, right? So we got, we got to, yeah. So it's like, we started on on the other end of the spectrum because a lot of it, I think, is because we all grew up with, I sort of defined it as three primary categories.
[00:21:03] The video may be just two. Obviously movies, television, and then some of us home videos, right? So some people will say, like, well, one, you know, my dad had a camera and he recorded us all the time. So they were on camera, but it's, you know, very intimate setting.
[00:21:17] And I think what happened is that a lot of us as we started to realize, hey, we have cameras in our pockets now. We've got these tools available.
[00:21:24] We thought about the kinds of video we had the most experience with, right? So, so of course we sort of immediately went to public facing video, television shows, stuff that, you know, thousands, millions of people might see and talk about intimidating, right?
[00:21:39] I mean, and I did the same thing. My very first video I ever made, I put on Facebook, you know, I may have even put some money behind it. So I've seen by quite a few people. And it took me months.
[00:21:48] I mean, I went out and I bought equipment and I set up a little mini studio and all the stuff I tell our students not to do now. I did it and it took me forever, but I still, you know, I'm a fairly early adopter. So this was still six years ago at this point.
[00:22:01] But yeah, I mean, I the further I got into it, the more I realized, like, well, cool, that was great. And if I do that consistently, I can do this branding thing. And you know, that all worked, especially over a long term period of time.
[00:22:11] But then I started sending video messages, you know, and that's that's your your example. I've had that happen a bunch of times. I mean, I had, you know, I was a totally new entity in the real estate space because we weren't we weren't working with REALTORS and we sort of made this pivot into real estate.
[00:22:26] And for anybody who's ever done that, you know, you kind of know how hard it can be to get through that front door, you know, obviously real estate is pitched all the time. All kinds of salespeople trying to sell to them.
[00:22:35] And so I was sending these video messages to brokers saying, hey, can I come in and do a presentation for your agents and talk about video and I was putting a video in those emails, you know, and I got booked. I got a lot of doors opened.
[00:22:48] And you know, I'd even have people tell me like, this is the most effective cold email I've ever gotten, you know, now granted, they've gotten more video emails since then. I'm not the only one doing it in St. Louis at this point.
[00:22:59] But I think there's there's another part of this kind of coming back to it to your example that is is really urgent, you know, because there's lots of reasons to get started doing this stuff right away.
[00:23:09] One thing that happens today, though, is that when somebody sees you make them a 30 second video that was just for them, they still have the same reaction of, hey, this, this feels like television.
[00:23:20] And so they look at it and they go, I would be too intimidated to do that. So that that is that additional layer of sort of like, wow, like, you know, so somebody who's used to making video, it's quicker than writing an email.
[00:23:32] So for them, they're like literally saving time. And then the recipient is going, oh my gosh, what a what an impressive, impressive effort feels like somebody did something big.
[00:23:41] Like what I saw this guy was it was in his is warehouse with all of his machines, you know, scribbling with the robotic hands writing letters. And I was like, wow, look, I'm getting behind the scenes tour of and literally all he does,
[00:23:55] and then he's pulling his phone out of his pocket, say, hey, DJ, I think I'd be, yeah, you're right. It seemed like a bigger deal to me than it than the effort that he put in.
[00:24:06] So the reaction you get is actually amplified more than the effort that's put in in theory, right?
[00:24:15] Yeah, yeah. And obviously that, you know, you can't know if that's going to happen with every person if you email somebody who's a professional, you know, TV presenter, something they're not going to be as impressed.
[00:24:24] But that is, I mean, and that's a big deal. I mean, that's especially like we, this is why we, we talked so much about birthday videos because every single person that gets that video from him, it was so little pressure on your part, right?
[00:24:35] I mean, you can literally go to Facebook on your phone on the app and you get a list of everybody's birthday and literally next to each name is a messenger button.
[00:24:43] You click that now you're going to one-on-one chat with them. And there's also a video recording feature built into the messenger app, you know?
[00:24:49] So you basically hold the button down, you say a few words and you click send and you can send 10 of these in like five minutes or less.
[00:24:55] I mean, that is, you know, in terms of habits, because obviously everything you want to do, you know, as much of it as possible should become a habit, makes a lot easier for you.
[00:25:03] I mean, that is a very, very easy habit to form, you know, is a everyday, as I get my coffee or as I have lunch or, you know, you tied to something you already do in daily, I'm going to pull my phone, I'm going to look at the list of birthdays, I'm going to send one to anybody who I want to say that to, you know, to do it to all your friends.
[00:25:18] But, but I mean, imagine like somebody's been dragging their feet on making their first video and they've been building this, this making it in this big mountain that they're having trouble kind of overcoming.
[00:25:26] Start there two weeks from now you've made 30 videos, you know, you've increased the awareness with 30 people substantially, you're developing those relationships, you may already have business from that outreach, even though all you're doing is saying happy birthday just from being top of mind, we had a, we had an agent pick up like a $3 million listing a few weeks after sending somebody a happy birthday video right so.
[00:25:47] You might have results already and it's like I just I can see I see people sometimes almost kick themselves because they thought five years ago they should start using video and they spent the past five years.
[00:25:58] Progressionating essentially right sort of finding reasons to keep waiting and it's harder than I thought it's you know since intimidating and then they send these birthday messages like wow this I should have started five years ago, you know, like this is not there's nothing about this that's hard and it has such an incredible impact you know I think that.
[00:26:14] It just resonates with people but the urgency I was talking about is that more every week more businesses are doing this you know and I think if you do it first in your industry and in the first cost you know the customers are kind of getting video messages from you first the advantage of that you you're an innovator this is stuff people go tell their friends about I mean wow you're the hot shot agent in town.
[00:26:34] If you wait another six months another year another couple years there will be other businesses doing it and now all you're doing is catching up right you don't you don't have the innovations the benefits still there but you don't set yourself apart the same way right.
[00:26:47] Boy I agree with all of that I actually think the one to one sort of option that we're talking about one to one meaning I'm going to produce a video for one person in this case the example of the happy birthday.
[00:27:03] This is such I'm only giggling because it is it I think about this I was thinking about this as you were talking that every year of course I have a birthday and Facebook tells you know the world that it's my birthday and I get you know however many people say happy birthday and I you know 100 or whatever it is and it's lovely and I'm so grateful for that I get exactly zero video messages from anybody.
[00:27:29] Who say you know hey I noticed it was a birthday today happy birthday even if it was a 15 second message do I remember who out of those hundred who wrote me on my Facebook page happy birthday no I I mean you know whatever it's probably the same people every every year I would remember who made me a 15 second video because it would be the only video and you're right it is a simple and easy thing and it's also a great way to get introduced to video if you're not coming back.
[00:27:58] I'm not going to be comfortable in front of the camera because there's really nothing at stake you're just be like hey happy birthday and that is and you know you can use there's other social media platforms that can be used to prompt things like this so birthday on Facebook absolutely like you said go there every day look first of all friend everybody you know on Facebook and Instagram and or Instagram doesn't have birthdays but or maybe they do I don't know but linked in LinkedIn does something very interesting where they show you.
[00:28:28] When people have work anniversaries so that's another huge opportunity oh I just saw you you know your fifth year at such and such company congratulations hope you're doing well or promotions or new jobs or you know other life events linked in is really good see that that's another place where you could find reasons to do that one to one short video but you know I've we've been doing this podcast for five or six years now nobody has talked about one to one videos I am so happy.
[00:28:58] So one to one video messaging I am really really grateful for you for this because it's kind of blowing my mind.
[00:29:06] Yeah well I yeah I mean I thought this is one of those things too it's like this is why I like you know within our school like I get to focus 100% on video my job is to learn about video and all different ways to use it and you know kind of be as much of an expert as I can and it's an incredibly broad category I mean we're you know there's so many different kinds of video.
[00:29:25] But yeah I mean that was one thing that I've still been I mean the companies that make these tools like you know just a name a few like you know bomb bomb does.
[00:29:35] Vigyard loom right they you know they all kind of do similar things now I mean they talk about this stuff obviously you know they some of these companies have written books and whatnot but I don't know if it's just the people just hear that as hey you're just trying to sell your product and so they tune it out or what but when I'm listening to it and I'm trying some of this stuff and I'm talking to some of these power users I mean it's it's a no.
[00:29:55] Brainer you know so a lot of the folks that I've seen that they get into a habit and hey I did this for three weeks I have never turning back I will never stop using this tool like my clients are all understanding me better my customer services improved drastically I'm getting more referrals I'm getting more repeat business it impacts everything and here we are and everybody's still talking about tick-tock and YouTube and all this other stuff you know and it's not you know it's like I think we get stuck in this whole you know one of the other type of mentality it's not that you don't ever do those things there's just a lot of things that I'm not going to do that.
[00:30:25] So I'm just so much more benefit to be had in the short term especially from this much more intimate you know much higher touch kind of kind of experience you know and so as soon as yeah I mean I've we we actually you know as as we started to understand more of this we sort of re re created our curriculum and our school to focus on it and we sort of redeveloped our entire process and we said look you start with video messages you know we actually have sort of four strategies we recommend people implement so they start with video messages they get that you know make that
[00:30:55] a regular part of how you talk to people you know to the point where it's like you just can't help but reply by video when it's appropriate then you start to incorporate video basically sort of scale yourself with video now so this is like your FAQs you know like training for employees if you tend to have employees on the team you know thing things where you're you're saying the same thing more than once in a several month long period right and so then that at that point then those videos not as intimidating you know it's not as hard make them because you have all this experience on camera now you know you're not going to be able to do that.
[00:31:25] You know and then it's like so then the third one is is build a video marketing funnel something that you you control that's designed that you can sort of predict the outcome from that you can you know put people in at the top and expect a certain amount of results to come out the bottom and then once all that is in place that's when we recommend doing the social media stuff you know and if you do it that way then all that new attention you generate from hopefully cross your fingers getting you know go viral on social media then all that attention which by the way is more likely because you're you're good
[00:31:55] on camera you know how to make a good video at this point you know that that drives those people into a system right so then they hit your marketing funnel they get they get nurtured by that automatically they come in you're you're using video to convert the leads so they're seeing you're continuing to see you you know it's like it's always it's always been kind of weird to me that we have these folks out there to have all this video from a marketing perspective running video ads are doing social media video and then somebody comes into their system and they stop seeing them on camera you know how all of a sudden everything's just text and email
[00:32:25] you know and I'm always just kind of like when they're kind of weird like you know they already know you at this point they've seen you on camera all these times you know and all of a sudden the communication becomes less personal feeling like that's interesting kind of disorienting you know so I think we do it the other way around you know it just continues to feel like I'm just getting to know this person that much more
[00:32:43] and yeah I mean I just the just the efficiency of this stuff you know getting to a point where by the time that person calls you and they say okay I'm ready to sell my house like they're well educated they've been watching you
[00:32:54] I mean you know I we hear examples all the time people talking about like the father and law disrupting a transaction or something it's like well now you can educate people ahead of time before they ever even contact you and they can forward those videos to their their relative and say hey you're you're wrong stop trying to tell me all this stuff you know but yeah there's just there's so many different ways of this has an impact and I think if you go in that order if you sort of start with the simpler stuff that that's more direct and then you build to the more public facing stuff I think it all just it just works more cohesively makes sense
[00:33:24] a lot more sense to your customers right it does and it's it's really a quite a shift of process if you're going to really think so you start with the easy quick video messages the one to one celebrate celebratory stuff or the universe you know things that are easy quick and you can you can just do daily you know happy birthday happy anniversary but all those kind of happy home anniversary whatever
[00:33:54] you do those and just a really quick procedural question because I'd love to get your thoughts so you'd mentioned you know like you go to Facebook you see here's five people's birthdays today you make five videos are you sending them the video via Facebook messenger which is you said you know you could do or are you texting it to them so that it's been my experience that people open as texts more often then like Facebook messenger but curious on what you might say
[00:34:24] that's just for like a happy birthday video.
[00:34:28] Yeah I think you're looking in that situation at a trade off between convenience versus impact right so I think if number one I don't have the phone numbers of a lot of my Facebook friends so because of that I just have to send
[00:34:40] this message that that's kind of the first question is what do you have in terms of contact info I also because it's so fluid you know and I have all kinds of quams with Facebook but not to get into that some of the stuff they do is really effective right so
[00:34:54] the birthday things I mean that that's been one of their their home runs from basically day one right they got everybody give them their birthday and that's been one of the things that keys people engage in the platform the fluidity of basically looking at the list
[00:35:06] clicking the I mean tonight and if you're listening to this like try this sometime you'll see how fluid it is right it's like you go in there's the messenger button you click it you click the button for the video camera turns on you hold it down you record you hit
[00:35:18] send I mean and then you'll just hit the back button two or three times and you're back on the list right so that you know so I'm always looking to kind of like if I tell somebody to do it certain ways like are they going to do it you know that
[00:35:29] that's obviously a challenge you run to with coaching quite a bit right so that would be that's the first thing I would say now you are right though which is that people are going to be more likely to see the text message right so I think the way I would sort of think about it is like if you have a core group you know so you've got maybe like those 20 30 40 people that are
[00:35:48] like they're the ones that pass you the referrals they're the ones that are repeat customers the ones you really want to stay you know 100% in front of that might be worsening them a text you know and then even and then even follow
[00:35:59] on up if you don't hear anything background you see 100% sort of certain that they're going to get it everybody else I think just doing it through Facebook is probably fine mostly because it is just so easy to do and it's a lot easier to build a habit because of that so I could
[00:36:14] set an alarm on my phone for 9 a.m. every day it goes off I go to Facebook boom semi five or 10 messages and I'm done so I would say you know think of it that way right what what's going to be sort of the most what are you going to be able to execute on regularly and I also I that's a great answer and I also love the idea sort of jumping ahead a bit to having these sort of intro videos as well so now that you you're going to be doing this regular happy birthday happy anniversary kind of kind of you know
[00:36:43] event focused you know videos you can also then create longer form videos that can be reused so hey you know here are 10 questions that first time home buyers 10 ask I'm going to send this to you I'm going to send you this video which will maybe answer some of your questions so I don't waste your time later on you know you know you sort of I guess you package it around this is to help you and us
[00:37:13] you know be more efficient or effective and provide value along the way is I made this little 5 10 minute video which is here some pitfalls to avoid or whatever or here's how to prepare for our meeting or here's what how the process works it can really be anything that a REALTOR has found that their clients continually ask about so that could be like a basis for how do I come up with these videos like what's the content think about the questions your most commonly asked and then you can make videos of the content
[00:37:43] and then you can make a video of the content that you can make about that and say hey I'm going to send this to you ahead of time and yeah I'm always available you can call me any time of course to but I want to sort of start edge leading you down a path and providing content to you that's relevant and valuable
[00:37:57] instead of you having to ask me I'm going to be pushing this to you proactively.
[00:38:03] Yeah yeah and I love that I mean that's where you know it's a shame because I feel like a lot of times in these sort of business context you have to talk about doing something from almost to a certain standpoint of making more money or growing your business right that's the hook right but it's it's a little bit too bad because videos so effective for customer service you know and I'd love to be talking more about that there are obviously a lot of agents that they care about that but that's the place where where all the impacts it has and there's there's I mean you can you can don't
[00:38:33] be a double in triple lead conversion means the numbers you know in terms of what video does or kind of mind blowing but the customer service part is really crazy to me because you can preempt I mean you can give people an experience where they feel like you're you're reading their mind right because you know what they're going to ask you know what the processes are you know or the the sticking points in a real strange transaction are going to be and this can all be automated I mean so it's this incredible experience where somebody comes in and every couple days or whatever the right you know touch free.
[00:39:03] So if you're going to have a frequency is they're getting you know hey by the way the next thing is going to happen is this and here's me explaining it to you and you know video allows you to show versus just tell you know so you can talk about we're going to fill out this document here it is here's what it looks like here's where you're going to put this information this this is why you need to have this number figured out because it's going to go here in this document I mean the sense of clarity that that creates for people is is immense and you cannot do it I mean it's almost one of those things where you can't even really do it in person I mean you can make a video that has a lot of
[00:39:33] like multiple different clips in it that cuts from one kind of you know piece of paper to another this is obviously getting a little more advanced but you can you can design it in such a way that it actually explains things in a way that's more fluid and more easy to understand that even if you were sitting in front of that person and showing them the papers you know so I think when you do that this is the kind of thing that that then people come in the door that they come in as a lead or maybe they become a customer they start getting this communication but it is you and I think that's the part of off folks overlook is like they're not going to be
[00:40:02] to just get an email with this text in it that that could have been written by anybody they're actually listening to you they're watching you there as far as their brain knows they're sitting there across the table from you while you explain all of this to them you know so it's building the relationship so you're helping them they appreciate that you're informing them this is the the smoothest real estate transaction they've ever been involved in but they're also getting to know you and so it's it's almost and I'll tell you I experienced this myself all the time now it's a little weird then when you meet that person
[00:40:32] because they know you there's it's called the parasocial relationship they already have a relationship with you as far as their brain knows they've talked to you several times already and and that's all going to be there you know so so once you do that on a regular basis for a few months like don't don't be surprised that a lot of these folks come in and they're much friendlier they're much more comfortable you know they're not at all considering working with another agent anymore like they've already hired you in their head
[00:40:58] and and just talk about I mean you're going to find a better fit you're going to have more of the right people choose to hire you you're going to have higher lead conversion
[00:41:07] transactions are going to a lot smoother I mean just just so many different things and then one additional part I'll just sort of throw into there
[00:41:14] is I really like these are all pre-recorded right so that's great you know tell me about the process but if you ever run into something that's especially like
[00:41:21] frustrating or has a lot of emotion to it that's where you really want to use video right so if you're going to share bad news like oh they didn't accept the offer you know that sort of thing
[00:41:30] record a video message because the empathy is substantially higher on video right so they can you know so even even phone calls you could call somebody but them watching your face and seeing your facial expressions and being able to read that empathy on your face that does still go much further
[00:41:48] so I think that's another place you can incorporate it to really you know maximize that that sort of sense of hey this person has the basis covered they're totally in control I can trust them completely
[00:42:01] and that I mean just in terms of the the enjoyable ability so to speak of the process and working with your customers it really helps
[00:42:08] Wow I mean we're almost talking a little bit of kind of a mini revolution here in communication like change
[00:42:15] Oh yeah like we're really talking about one to one video communication whether it's pre-recorded or live
[00:42:23] there is something that activates and lights up our brain and makes us feel connected to the other person
[00:42:33] and through repetition whether it's again whether it's pre-recorded or live you start the brain starts to sort of build these neural pathways of familiarity
[00:42:43] so all of a sudden we're like oh I know I know I know Nick I see Nick all the time he's familiar to me which familiar
[00:42:49] means comfortable which means non-threatening which is which is typically a gateway to the ability to
[00:42:56] sell somebody something right so trust we're now talking about you know no liking trust and I think
[00:43:04] you're you're really on the cusp of this and agents that can start to move away from the
[00:43:11] and not that there's anything wrong with texting if that's appropriate for a relationship great
[00:43:16] but you can pepper in like I love the idea of the bad news video message so let's do a real like a
[00:43:25] a use case example so I'm a REALTOR my client loses this bit that they put in this this offered
[00:43:31] bio home I have to give them bad news now would you recommend I do that live video would you
[00:43:39] recommend a pre-recorded video what do you think is is and again it could be anything every relationship
[00:43:46] different but what's a general rule of thumb on something like that yeah I mean I think that one's
[00:43:52] that one's gonna depend on the customer a little bit I think it depends on sort of you know the
[00:43:56] question the difference between those two is that when you when you try to get on like a video
[00:44:00] chat with them you're interrupting them so it's like a phone call that's one of the disadvantage of
[00:44:05] phone calls they have to answer and you're disrupting their day and they might not be they might not
[00:44:10] be in a place where physically they want to be seen right yeah they might not want to be on camera
[00:44:15] you know they might not feel you know so but that being said depending on the type of client like
[00:44:20] they might prefer that because they want to ask questions they want to you know they want to be
[00:44:24] able to dig in a little bit on it on the other hand if you pre-record it they can watch it at any
[00:44:29] time you can be succinct you can get straight to the point you know you can get right to the news
[00:44:33] right off the bat so it really just depends on how the previous communication has been going right
[00:44:39] so I think the the thing to look at there is like is this somebody who calls you you know do they like
[00:44:44] having a lot of conversations on the phone if you've done zoom meetings with them in that case I
[00:44:48] would say hey would you mind hopping on zoom for a couple minutes I want to give you an update on
[00:44:52] on the situation here right sure and again that's one where you want to get to it quick because you
[00:44:56] don't want them you know waiting for for hours to to get that info on the other hand if it's somebody
[00:45:01] who's been doing a lot of texting with you or things like email which are you know we call it a
[00:45:05] synchronous right so it's something you can watch at any time it doesn't have to happen right at
[00:45:09] that moment then a pre-recorded message is probably going to be better for them I love that too and
[00:45:15] at the end of a pre-recorded message you can always say I'm going to call you in a couple hours
[00:45:19] to just to check in on you as well but I wanted I didn't want to wait for this I didn't want to
[00:45:23] wait a couple hours I wanted to get make get this information over to you immediately um that is
[00:45:30] that's huge all of this all of this is huge and and I guess at the end of the day it demonstrates
[00:45:37] care concern effort whether it's warranted or not is another conversation meaning for some reason
[00:45:45] our our physicality are the way that we are built as humans we just like that we just like getting
[00:45:53] one-on-one videos I mean it's just kind of how it how we're wired so if forget about anything other
[00:46:00] than it just it used to be it felt good to get and it still does feels good to get a handwritten
[00:46:05] letter those are pretty much done uh now although I still think that that is an amazing thing but
[00:46:12] what's taken its place is these one-to-one videos I think and they're still very rare so if you can
[00:46:18] make a one-to-one video process again start with birthdays start with home anniversaries start with
[00:46:26] you know uh I hope your kids are going doing well uh when they're going back to school this fall
[00:46:31] you know whatever could be it's your kids birthday happy birthday whatever you need to get this
[00:46:35] information um put it in and and you can do those all day long and even if you just did that if
[00:46:43] nothing else if all you did was birthdays and any other you know life event stuff that you know
[00:46:50] I bet you'd get I bet you'd get business just just from doing that uh and obviously that's like
[00:46:56] 1% of what you can actually do um and and it's to learn the other 99% um that is what Nick and his
[00:47:04] company is going to teach you so Nick tell us about about the service and uh and you know what it
[00:47:10] entails and why our listeners should be checking it out yeah I mean I think the the main thing to
[00:47:15] understand about business video school is you know it's a school for real estate agents it's about 95
[00:47:20] percent of our students are real estate agents um and we teach pretty much all aspects of video now
[00:47:27] I will say we're not for the video expert so if you've been making video for five years and you've
[00:47:31] already got a YouTube channel with hundreds of thousands of followers that kind of stuff like
[00:47:35] you know there there's people to help you and we certainly could but that's not who we're built for
[00:47:39] we're built for the beginner so beginner and intermediate right so folks that are you know having
[00:47:43] trouble making your first video or maybe you've made a few but it hasn't become a habit everything
[00:47:48] we do is about building video habits right so um just you know kind of a quick overview of what we
[00:47:53] have included there's a lot so you don't you don't kind of come in and try to take it all at once
[00:47:57] we've got nine different courses some of which we teach live on a monthly or quarterly basis
[00:48:02] we have something called video recipes which is a script and example of us doing the video ourselves
[00:48:08] you can imitate our delivery style it's all the instructions on how to make it it's the social media
[00:48:12] posts it's any sort of assets like music that might go in the video so basically all the ingredients
[00:48:18] you need to make a video we make a new one of those every week and then we do things you know a lot
[00:48:22] of fun stuff like we have challenges every month we split up into teams kind of compete to make
[00:48:26] different themed videos we have Q&A sessions live Q&As you can come on to if you ever get stuck
[00:48:31] and then a community you know I think the community is is a big part of it it's just a bunch of folks
[00:48:36] that are it's it's very much no judgment you know so there's a lot of folks sharing I this is my
[00:48:40] first video I ever made you know what do you think and obviously there's lots of things they can
[00:48:44] improve but we're just there to encourage and when they're first getting started obviously so
[00:48:47] I think that that's really what you got to look at is that video it's a form of communication and
[00:48:53] it is going to take some time to really start to understand and implement fully so we work with
[00:48:58] folks sort of incrementally speaking so you can come in you take a class or two you work on
[00:49:02] implementing you come in with your Q&As and you need them and that's why we set it up as a
[00:49:06] membership because we felt like hey it'd be nice if it's not just a course you don't just buy
[00:49:10] something it sits on your computer and you got nobody to talk to like we wanted to have that
[00:49:13] community and have the the support the ability to come in and kind of get your questions answered
[00:49:18] and that's what it comes down to you know so so a video is is a concern you know if it's something
[00:49:22] that you want to do more with I strongly recommend you come check us out and obviously it's one of
[00:49:28] those things that the sooner you do it the more benefit you're going to get because it is only

[00:50:15] commission so I'd spend a thousand dollars to make seven thousand dollars guys please please do
[00:50:20] this video is is what people are there's a little bit of a desert of the last three years of
[00:50:30] of you know interpersonal communication intimacy physical interactions right we we even now we
[00:50:36] are still recovering from this lack of of in-person stuff video is the closest thing we have to
[00:50:44] simulating real life interactions it works way better than text and email and and other

Thanks for having me on. Very excited to chat with you. You know, the world's really changed a lot. Well, the world's always changing, but certainly with the advent three years ago, you know, with when COVID hit and we were doing work from home, I saw a shift in REALTORS really probably more at a desperation than anything, but just embracing some of the video, conferencing technology, you know, more video production when it comes to social media. And I've seen agents continue to evolve their video practices, even now we're largely back to normal and we're moving around and about of course. I'm still seeing that trend continue. Obviously the rise of TikTok has also increased the popularity of video. But I am so excited to have you on the show because I want to talk all things video. You know, this is something that I think every one of our listeners or viewers can relate to and try to figure out as they determine what they want to spend their time and energy on in 2023. I think video is a great skill that really anyone can develop and obviously you teach people how to do that. So excited to have you on. Awesome. Yeah. Now I love talking about this of it. It's the pandemic certainly sort of accelerated and disrupted all kinds of stuff with videos. So it's been an interesting three years. Well, let's let's talk about the role of video. So first, well, let's get into your background before we actually start giving suggestions to agents. So what brought you into into this space? Yeah. So I mean, I've been so I actually, you know, when I went to college, I started working as a freshman for a company called college works painting. I ended up working there for six years. And in that experience, like you basically you run a small painting business, kind of like an internship program. And so that was my first experience with with marketing, which I'll sort of put quotes around because there was a lot of door knocking. Just going out knocking on doors, putting flyers out, you know, all that stuff. And, you know, it's going going to waste back at this point. But the reason I bring that up is because I basically have been working and marketing ever since. And so it's something that I've been good at in some areas, you know, really bad at in others. What happened though is I actually started a company. Man, it's been almost eight years, I think, at this point. And what we did is we would put out flyers for other businesses, right? So we got working with real estate agencies as a result of that because of the concept of farming. We had this cool sticky flyer. You could like stick right in the middle of a front door. Very, you know, I got kind of catching. And so we started working with them and started doing this farming stuff. And that was probably about six years ago. And I was right when video was really starting to emerge as a marketing tool for small businesses. And so there was kind of this big, this big, cut of moment in time where, you know, you can start to run your own Facebook video ads. You can start to run YouTube ads. And very few small businesses were even kind of aware of these possibilities. And so we kind of went to these agents who you're working with too, and these flyers. And part of it was we didn't want to be out there, you know, putting flyers on doors for the rest of our lives. Or like, what could we do that's a little bit more sustainable? And so we started making videos with them and, you know, bringing them into our studio and coaching them on camera. And, you know, a lot of it ended up being sort of psychological stuff, you know, getting over that fear of the camera, getting over their, you know, quams about seeing themselves on that video screen. And then three years ago, right around the beginning of the pandemic, actually a little before that, we started to realize, you know, hey, these people are coming, we're making a video with them. You think this would kickstart this sort of brand effort. Hey, I'm going to use video everywhere. I'm going to start, you know, sending my clients video messages. I'm starting making social media videos, you know, and it wasn't happening, you know. And that's what kind of led us to saying, well, there's a gap here. You know, there's something people are missing or they're misunderstanding. You know, how to use video is at the technical steps and the more research we did, it was sort of all of it, you know, and we said, okay, well, we need to build a training program for this. We need to start teaching people how to use this new form of communication, which is the way that we saw it. And so timing, it worked out perfect because we actually, we built a course and piloted it. We launched that December of 2019. And so like within three months, the pandemic swept the country and, I mean, literally we got shut down. We weren't allowed to make videos of people for a couple months. And that was a forced pivot, obviously, but we sort of immediately said, all right, let's start doing this training. We got this course. Let's see what we can do. We brought some partners in. And I think we had 900 people come through that first course within about three months, you know. So it's like, okay, there's clearly clearly a need for what we're doing here. And we've just been kind of running ever since. I, that's amazing. I remember back really before video was so prevalent in social media in particular, when you would go to do anything in the video, they would typically ask you, have you been media trained, right? That was that was the old, the old sort of skill set that have you been, you've been in front of a camera before. This is really before we all just had, you know, high definition cameras in our pockets that could, you know, take almost comparable shots with, you know, with these $20,000 cameras. And so it used to be a thing where you were like, no, you really do need to get trained. You need to know what to say and whatnot to say. And you still do need to get trained. But thankfully the barrier to entry obviously is, you know, your phone, which everyone has. And so let's, I think first, what would probably make the most sense for our audience is let's set, let's make the case for video. And when we talk about video, let's define what we're talking about. Why should REALTORS be focused on video this year? Yeah, and I love that question because I think, you know, a lot of folks, they get into tactics or strategy way too fast, you know, a lot of these conversations, they go straight to like, all right, what kind of video should I make? And that was one thing that stood out to me when we first started the school and we started looking into, hey, what exists out there is that a lot of the recorded presentations, a lot of the top, you know, stuff people were talking on was just so far down the path in our eyes, you know, it's sort of like, hey, they're skipping a lot of steps here and a wonder people are thinking they should do these things, but they're not taking action because they're overwhelmed, they're confused, you know, it's kind of the byproduct of the way it's being talked about. So, so yeah, I think I think it's taking a step back and asking ourselves like, well, what is it? What is video? Right? I mean, so that that's where I started. It's like, in my mind, videos, a form of communication. And I think it's important to see it that way because everything we do to communicate with someone remotely. So, if I'm going to send a text and email, it used to be sending letters, we don't do much of that anymore, but you know, letters, all that kind of stuff, it was all kind of created to supplement or sort of replace a face to face conversation. So, the only reason we ever do any of these other kinds of communication is because we can't be physically face to face with that other person, right? So, if we sort of say, okay, well, ideally I get into the same room, I'm sitting across from the table, we all know that when we're in that context, we're able to build relationships the most effectively, we're able to close deals at the highest rate, all of that stuff is kind of maximized. Well, that's what video simulates better than anything else. So, when we compare it to a phone call, all this kind of stuff, the only form of communication we have available that feels as close to a face to face conversation is clearly video, right? And that has a ton to do a trust. So, when I can see somebody, I mean, there's actually part of my brains called the fused-of-form gyros that recognizes other people's faces and it stores that information, it tells us, hey, have I seen this person before? There's an element of how many times, right? If it's somebody I've seen a bunch, I automatically trust you because my brain says, hey, this must be somebody who's sort of part of my tribe, right? I see them every day or I see them every day. They're safe because I see them visually, either in my visual space occasionally. Right. And we evolve, I mean, what's interesting is, throughout evolution, we have not evolved to understand really any of these other forms of communication. So, our brains at a fundamental level, when they see a person's face, the only thing that your brain can really understand is that person must be in the room with me. So, consciously, we know it's not, but most of our brain is non-conscious, right? It sort of... It bypasses a little bit of those critical factors of the brain. So, when we see someone, especially, you're so right because it's not even just face, I think, I think when people are taking full-body videos, it's like all of a sudden, we know what their physical being looks like. And just like we would with an actor or somebody on television, we feel connected in some small way, consciously or unconsciously, simply because we are brain thinks, you know, that, yeah, you're right, we're in close proximity with them even though we're not. Yeah. And that's huge. And it's actually, I emphasize this a lot in our trainings when I talk about how you frame yourself in a video, right? So, a lot of folks, like if they send a video to somebody, their head is for some reason in the bottom half of the frame. You've probably seen this where it's like, you know, vertical video and their head's right out of the bottom and they go all space above it, you know, for no reason. And a lot of it's just they don't know how to hold the phone or they feel a little uncomfortable about putting their body out there. But that takes away from that experience, right? So, rather, like, that makes my brain question what's going on. Now, I'm kind of like, well, I think I'm talking to this person, but like, it's just their head floating there, which is kind of weird, right? So, yeah, I think the more any kind of video, I mean, this goes for public stuff, it goes for the more intimate one to one video messages, you know, you should try to sort of appear like you would in front of that person if you were sitting across the table, right? So, you want to incorporate some of your body, you want to make sure your face is large enough that they can read all your facial expressions. You know, you want to be somewhat careful about lighting, but mostly just so they can clearly see your face. Not because you had to look perfect, but you need to make sure they can see you just like they would if they were face to face. And if you do that, I mean, that it's a game changer, right? I mean, this is like, I love sending video messages. Like, I love to send people like happy birthday videos 10 seconds long. It's such a perfect example of this because then they see me, right? They have that sort of mini experience of having this kind of really quick face to face chat, but they remember it for months. I mean, I've had people that I'll send them a birthday video one year and the year later, I miss it. And they're sending me a message like, hey, where's my birthday video? You know, because they remember it from a year before, right? So there's all that, there's all that stuff that's going on in the human mind. And the reality is once you get used to doing this, a lot of people look at video and they're intimidated and they kind of put it off because of that. But once you get used to using, especially video kind of as a one to one or one to just a few people form of communication, it doesn't take any more time. Right? So the time it takes to sit in front of the camera and say, hey, let me give you a quick update on the transaction. Here's what's going on. In my experience, it's actually faster than typing it out because I'm, you know, I type and I make some mistakes. I got to fix it and you get over think what you're saying. Make sure they don't misinterpret what you wrote with a video. You don't have to worry about that. People understand it better. We actually comprehend more information when we can watch a person talking versus just reading the text on the screen. So they're, I mean, you know, we could sort of create a huge laundry list to sort of all the benefits for it. But I think at a fundamental level, it's what you have to remind yourself is, hey, this is, it's not always a performance, right? It can be a performance just like you can write a blog post that might get read by thousands of people. But we can also send a text or an email, right? And we don't we don't overthink those things. We just do it. It's just part of our day to day experience. That's where I think people really need to focus on videos. How, how do you just make it a normal thing you do as part of your day to day communication? And if you start there, number one, you see benefits a lot faster. It has an impact immediately. And then you also get so much more comfortable on camera. So when it comes, you know, few weeks later, a few months later, when you're getting ready to build that YouTube channel or build that tick-tock, you're much more comfortable, you're much more confident on camera, and you just move a lot faster because of that. So I think there's, you know, I think a lot of us have sort of mixed that up. We sort of started on the hard end. And we need to sort of reset a little bit and come back to the beginning. Boy, you just said so much and my brain is spinning a little bit because I was thinking we were going to really pretty much exclusively talk about how to do video better on social media. And you said something, and of course, you do teach that. But I am, you said something that really resonated with me today, specifically because it just happened to me just before we started our show. So this is so perfect because you were talking about using video for more regular communication. So yes, of course, there's a social media sort of strategy there and, and you know, people, REALTORS are always trying to figure out how much of my personal life do I display, do I put on display on my Facebook page and Instagram, etc. But you're saying we're really talking about a different thing right now, which I think is really critical because this just happened to me before our show, which was you can send one to one messages to people. Because we think about branding and like I'm going to put this out on Facebook, everyone's going to see it. Like you said thousands of people might read a blog post or see a video. But then there's also one to one communication. And I just receive I will tell you I, we get pitched by advertisers, guests every single day on our show, a publicist, you know, whoever reach out, you know, hey, book our guest. I got it. This has probably happened in five years. I've out of thousands of pitches. I've probably had this happen five times out of thousands, no joke. And it was, hey, I made a video for you. I want you to check this out. I didn't know if this was a guest. I didn't know if it was a vendor. I didn't know anything. I didn't know what it was. Could have been a spam message. I had no idea. But he's like, hey, DJ or actually wasn't even meant to me. It's for a producer. But there was like, hey, Zana, check this out. And this guy has this company where he does computerized or robotic handwritten, you know, the cards and notes and things. Anyway, and he was like, hey, DJ, I want to show this to you. I think there's be a good fit for you show. Now because I watched his 35 second video where he kind of like, I'm like, oh, I know this guy. I instantly like him. And I don't know anything about him. He might be a horrible human being. He might be a he might actually not be a good human being. I don't know, but I liked him instantly because he took the time to make a video. I can't even explain why I liked him. But there's this unconscious part of the brain that when some when you do see somebody, you have a tendency to want to connect with them. And so that there's a visual component that bypasses even logic. Like, I don't know this guy. He's just some dude trying to get on my show, which happens all day long. Why do I really want. And by the way, he's not the only person with this exact kind of business. There's lots of businesses that have these robotic things that handwrite thing. So it's not even a unique value proposition. But for some reason, I got so excited that he made me a video. He made me. Yeah. Even though it took him probably a minute to do it. It was crazy effective. Had he had just written me and said, hey, I've got this thing. I probably would have been like, and I know. Yeah, there's something that lit up my brain automatically, the fact that I got a video message, a one to one video message. And I know that isn't necessarily the purpose of our conversation. But it just happened to me. And it really affected it affected the way. And we were like, I'm like, just book him immediately book him. Wow. Yeah. No, I mean, I love that actually. I mean, I think realistically, I mean, there's a lot of people talking about how to do video for social media. I mean, you know, because you get there's there's a whole career of influencer, right? So there's people out there who's job is to grow following on social media. And I think it's, it's a little bit unfortunate that so many business owners are looking to those people. And they're learning about video from them. You know, I mean, they're, then there's, you know, they're not all bad is that it's not a comment that they shouldn't be doing that. But it's a distraction. I think that's the real problem, right? Is that there are, you know, I actually put out a sort of small survey on LinkedIn the other day, it says curious. It's like, well, hey, remember when email first came out, you know, it's been about 30 years at this point, right? But it's like, remember when it first came out, how did you use it initially? Did you send email to a single person at a time? Did you send it to like small groups? Or did you blast out, you know, massive newsletters to thousands of people? And obviously every single person said, I sent emails to just one person, right? Yeah. And we missed that step with video, right? So we got, we got to, yeah. So it's like, we started on on the other end of the spectrum because a lot of it, I think, is because we all grew up with, I sort of defined it as three primary categories. The video may be just two. Obviously movies, television, and then some of us home videos, right? So some people will say, like, well, one, you know, my dad had a camera and he recorded us all the time. So they were on camera, but it's, you know, very intimate setting. And I think what happened is that a lot of us as we started to realize, hey, we have cameras in our pockets now. We've got these tools available. We thought about the kinds of video we had the most experience with, right? So, so of course we sort of immediately went to public facing video, television shows, stuff that, you know, thousands, millions of people might see and talk about intimidating, right? I mean, and I did the same thing. My very first video I ever made, I put on Facebook, you know, I may have even put some money behind it. So I've seen by quite a few people. And it took me months. I mean, I went out and I bought equipment and I set up a little mini studio and all the stuff I tell our students not to do now. I did it and it took me forever, but I still, you know, I'm a fairly early adopter. So this was still six years ago at this point. But yeah, I mean, I the further I got into it, the more I realized, like, well, cool, that was great. And if I do that consistently, I can do this branding thing. And you know, that all worked, especially over a long term period of time. But then I started sending video messages, you know, and that's that's your your example. I've had that happen a bunch of times. I mean, I had, you know, I was a totally new entity in the real estate space because we weren't we weren't working with REALTORS and we sort of made this pivot into real estate. And for anybody who's ever done that, you know, you kind of know how hard it can be to get through that front door, you know, obviously real estate is pitched all the time. All kinds of salespeople trying to sell to them. And so I was sending these video messages to brokers saying, hey, can I come in and do a presentation for your agents and talk about video and I was putting a video in those emails, you know, and I got booked. I got a lot of doors opened. And you know, I'd even have people tell me like, this is the most effective cold email I've ever gotten, you know, now granted, they've gotten more video emails since then. I'm not the only one doing it in St. Louis at this point. But I think there's there's another part of this kind of coming back to it to your example that is is really urgent, you know, because there's lots of reasons to get started doing this stuff right away. One thing that happens today, though, is that when somebody sees you make them a 30 second video that was just for them, they still have the same reaction of, hey, this, this feels like television. And so they look at it and they go, I would be too intimidated to do that. So that that is that additional layer of sort of like, wow, like, you know, so somebody who's used to making video, it's quicker than writing an email. So for them, they're like literally saving time. And then the recipient is going, oh my gosh, what a what an impressive, impressive effort feels like somebody did something big. Like what I saw this guy was it was in his is warehouse with all of his machines, you know, scribbling with the robotic hands writing letters. And I was like, wow, look, I'm getting behind the scenes tour of and literally all he does, and then he's pulling his phone out of his pocket, say, hey, DJ, I think I'd be, yeah, you're right. It seemed like a bigger deal to me than it than the effort that he put in. So the reaction you get is actually amplified more than the effort that's put in in theory, right? Yeah, yeah. And obviously that, you know, you can't know if that's going to happen with every person if you email somebody who's a professional, you know, TV presenter, something they're not going to be as impressed. But that is, I mean, and that's a big deal. I mean, that's especially like we, this is why we, we talked so much about birthday videos because every single person that gets that video from him, it was so little pressure on your part, right? I mean, you can literally go to Facebook on your phone on the app and you get a list of everybody's birthday and literally next to each name is a messenger button. You click that now you're going to one-on-one chat with them. And there's also a video recording feature built into the messenger app, you know? So you basically hold the button down, you say a few words and you click send and you can send 10 of these in like five minutes or less. I mean, that is, you know, in terms of habits, because obviously everything you want to do, you know, as much of it as possible should become a habit, makes a lot easier for you. I mean, that is a very, very easy habit to form, you know, is a everyday, as I get my coffee or as I have lunch or, you know, you tied to something you already do in daily, I'm going to pull my phone, I'm going to look at the list of birthdays, I'm going to send one to anybody who I want to say that to, you know, to do it to all your friends. But, but I mean, imagine like somebody's been dragging their feet on making their first video and they've been building this, this making it in this big mountain that they're having trouble kind of overcoming. Start there two weeks from now you've made 30 videos, you know, you've increased the awareness with 30 people substantially, you're developing those relationships, you may already have business from that outreach, even though all you're doing is saying happy birthday just from being top of mind, we had a, we had an agent pick up like a $3 million listing a few weeks after sending somebody a happy birthday video right so. You might have results already and it's like I just I can see I see people sometimes almost kick themselves because they thought five years ago they should start using video and they spent the past five years. Progressionating essentially right sort of finding reasons to keep waiting and it's harder than I thought it's you know since intimidating and then they send these birthday messages like wow this I should have started five years ago, you know, like this is not there's nothing about this that's hard and it has such an incredible impact you know I think that. It just resonates with people but the urgency I was talking about is that more every week more businesses are doing this you know and I think if you do it first in your industry and in the first cost you know the customers are kind of getting video messages from you first the advantage of that you you're an innovator this is stuff people go tell their friends about I mean wow you're the hot shot agent in town. If you wait another six months another year another couple years there will be other businesses doing it and now all you're doing is catching up right you don't you don't have the innovations the benefits still there but you don't set yourself apart the same way right. Boy I agree with all of that I actually think the one to one sort of option that we're talking about one to one meaning I'm going to produce a video for one person in this case the example of the happy birthday. This is such I'm only giggling because it is it I think about this I was thinking about this as you were talking that every year of course I have a birthday and Facebook tells you know the world that it's my birthday and I get you know however many people say happy birthday and I you know 100 or whatever it is and it's lovely and I'm so grateful for that I get exactly zero video messages from anybody. Who say you know hey I noticed it was a birthday today happy birthday even if it was a 15 second message do I remember who out of those hundred who wrote me on my Facebook page happy birthday no I I mean you know whatever it's probably the same people every every year I would remember who made me a 15 second video because it would be the only video and you're right it is a simple and easy thing and it's also a great way to get introduced to video if you're not coming back. I'm not going to be comfortable in front of the camera because there's really nothing at stake you're just be like hey happy birthday and that is and you know you can use there's other social media platforms that can be used to prompt things like this so birthday on Facebook absolutely like you said go there every day look first of all friend everybody you know on Facebook and Instagram and or Instagram doesn't have birthdays but or maybe they do I don't know but linked in LinkedIn does something very interesting where they show you. When people have work anniversaries so that's another huge opportunity oh I just saw you you know your fifth year at such and such company congratulations hope you're doing well or promotions or new jobs or you know other life events linked in is really good see that that's another place where you could find reasons to do that one to one short video but you know I've we've been doing this podcast for five or six years now nobody has talked about one to one videos I am so happy. So one to one video messaging I am really really grateful for you for this because it's kind of blowing my mind. Yeah well I yeah I mean I thought this is one of those things too it's like this is why I like you know within our school like I get to focus 100% on video my job is to learn about video and all different ways to use it and you know kind of be as much of an expert as I can and it's an incredibly broad category I mean we're you know there's so many different kinds of video. But yeah I mean that was one thing that I've still been I mean the companies that make these tools like you know just a name a few like you know bomb bomb does. Vigyard loom right they you know they all kind of do similar things now I mean they talk about this stuff obviously you know they some of these companies have written books and whatnot but I don't know if it's just the people just hear that as hey you're just trying to sell your product and so they tune it out or what but when I'm listening to it and I'm trying some of this stuff and I'm talking to some of these power users I mean it's it's a no. Brainer you know so a lot of the folks that I've seen that they get into a habit and hey I did this for three weeks I have never turning back I will never stop using this tool like my clients are all understanding me better my customer services improved drastically I'm getting more referrals I'm getting more repeat business it impacts everything and here we are and everybody's still talking about tick-tock and YouTube and all this other stuff you know and it's not you know it's like I think we get stuck in this whole you know one of the other type of mentality it's not that you don't ever do those things there's just a lot of things that I'm not going to do that. So I'm just so much more benefit to be had in the short term especially from this much more intimate you know much higher touch kind of kind of experience you know and so as soon as yeah I mean I've we we actually you know as as we started to understand more of this we sort of re re created our curriculum and our school to focus on it and we sort of redeveloped our entire process and we said look you start with video messages you know we actually have sort of four strategies we recommend people implement so they start with video messages they get that you know make that a regular part of how you talk to people you know to the point where it's like you just can't help but reply by video when it's appropriate then you start to incorporate video basically sort of scale yourself with video now so this is like your FAQs you know like training for employees if you tend to have employees on the team you know thing things where you're you're saying the same thing more than once in a several month long period right and so then that at that point then those videos not as intimidating you know it's not as hard make them because you have all this experience on camera now you know you're not going to be able to do that. You know and then it's like so then the third one is is build a video marketing funnel something that you you control that's designed that you can sort of predict the outcome from that you can you know put people in at the top and expect a certain amount of results to come out the bottom and then once all that is in place that's when we recommend doing the social media stuff you know and if you do it that way then all that new attention you generate from hopefully cross your fingers getting you know go viral on social media then all that attention which by the way is more likely because you're you're good on camera you know how to make a good video at this point you know that that drives those people into a system right so then they hit your marketing funnel they get they get nurtured by that automatically they come in you're you're using video to convert the leads so they're seeing you're continuing to see you you know it's like it's always it's always been kind of weird to me that we have these folks out there to have all this video from a marketing perspective running video ads are doing social media video and then somebody comes into their system and they stop seeing them on camera you know how all of a sudden everything's just text and email you know and I'm always just kind of like when they're kind of weird like you know they already know you at this point they've seen you on camera all these times you know and all of a sudden the communication becomes less personal feeling like that's interesting kind of disorienting you know so I think we do it the other way around you know it just continues to feel like I'm just getting to know this person that much more and yeah I mean I just the just the efficiency of this stuff you know getting to a point where by the time that person calls you and they say okay I'm ready to sell my house like they're well educated they've been watching you I mean you know I we hear examples all the time people talking about like the father and law disrupting a transaction or something it's like well now you can educate people ahead of time before they ever even contact you and they can forward those videos to their their relative and say hey you're you're wrong stop trying to tell me all this stuff you know but yeah there's just there's so many different ways of this has an impact and I think if you go in that order if you sort of start with the simpler stuff that that's more direct and then you build to the more public facing stuff I think it all just it just works more cohesively makes sense a lot more sense to your customers right it does and it's it's really a quite a shift of process if you're going to really think so you start with the easy quick video messages the one to one celebrate celebratory stuff or the universe you know things that are easy quick and you can you can just do daily you know happy birthday happy anniversary but all those kind of happy home anniversary whatever you do those and just a really quick procedural question because I'd love to get your thoughts so you'd mentioned you know like you go to Facebook you see here's five people's birthdays today you make five videos are you sending them the video via Facebook messenger which is you said you know you could do or are you texting it to them so that it's been my experience that people open as texts more often then like Facebook messenger but curious on what you might say that's just for like a happy birthday video. Yeah I think you're looking in that situation at a trade off between convenience versus impact right so I think if number one I don't have the phone numbers of a lot of my Facebook friends so because of that I just have to send this message that that's kind of the first question is what do you have in terms of contact info I also because it's so fluid you know and I have all kinds of quams with Facebook but not to get into that some of the stuff they do is really effective right so the birthday things I mean that that's been one of their their home runs from basically day one right they got everybody give them their birthday and that's been one of the things that keys people engage in the platform the fluidity of basically looking at the list clicking the I mean tonight and if you're listening to this like try this sometime you'll see how fluid it is right it's like you go in there's the messenger button you click it you click the button for the video camera turns on you hold it down you record you hit send I mean and then you'll just hit the back button two or three times and you're back on the list right so that you know so I'm always looking to kind of like if I tell somebody to do it certain ways like are they going to do it you know that that's obviously a challenge you run to with coaching quite a bit right so that would be that's the first thing I would say now you are right though which is that people are going to be more likely to see the text message right so I think the way I would sort of think about it is like if you have a core group you know so you've got maybe like those 20 30 40 people that are like they're the ones that pass you the referrals they're the ones that are repeat customers the ones you really want to stay you know 100% in front of that might be worsening them a text you know and then even and then even follow on up if you don't hear anything background you see 100% sort of certain that they're going to get it everybody else I think just doing it through Facebook is probably fine mostly because it is just so easy to do and it's a lot easier to build a habit because of that so I could set an alarm on my phone for 9 a.m. every day it goes off I go to Facebook boom semi five or 10 messages and I'm done so I would say you know think of it that way right what what's going to be sort of the most what are you going to be able to execute on regularly and I also I that's a great answer and I also love the idea sort of jumping ahead a bit to having these sort of intro videos as well so now that you you're going to be doing this regular happy birthday happy anniversary kind of kind of you know event focused you know videos you can also then create longer form videos that can be reused so hey you know here are 10 questions that first time home buyers 10 ask I'm going to send this to you I'm going to send you this video which will maybe answer some of your questions so I don't waste your time later on you know you know you sort of I guess you package it around this is to help you and us you know be more efficient or effective and provide value along the way is I made this little 5 10 minute video which is here some pitfalls to avoid or whatever or here's how to prepare for our meeting or here's what how the process works it can really be anything that a REALTOR has found that their clients continually ask about so that could be like a basis for how do I come up with these videos like what's the content think about the questions your most commonly asked and then you can make videos of the content and then you can make a video of the content that you can make about that and say hey I'm going to send this to you ahead of time and yeah I'm always available you can call me any time of course to but I want to sort of start edge leading you down a path and providing content to you that's relevant and valuable instead of you having to ask me I'm going to be pushing this to you proactively. Yeah yeah and I love that I mean that's where you know it's a shame because I feel like a lot of times in these sort of business context you have to talk about doing something from almost to a certain standpoint of making more money or growing your business right that's the hook right but it's it's a little bit too bad because videos so effective for customer service you know and I'd love to be talking more about that there are obviously a lot of agents that they care about that but that's the place where where all the impacts it has and there's there's I mean you can you can don't be a double in triple lead conversion means the numbers you know in terms of what video does or kind of mind blowing but the customer service part is really crazy to me because you can preempt I mean you can give people an experience where they feel like you're you're reading their mind right because you know what they're going to ask you know what the processes are you know or the the sticking points in a real strange transaction are going to be and this can all be automated I mean so it's this incredible experience where somebody comes in and every couple days or whatever the right you know touch free. So if you're going to have a frequency is they're getting you know hey by the way the next thing is going to happen is this and here's me explaining it to you and you know video allows you to show versus just tell you know so you can talk about we're going to fill out this document here it is here's what it looks like here's where you're going to put this information this this is why you need to have this number figured out because it's going to go here in this document I mean the sense of clarity that that creates for people is is immense and you cannot do it I mean it's almost one of those things where you can't even really do it in person I mean you can make a video that has a lot of like multiple different clips in it that cuts from one kind of you know piece of paper to another this is obviously getting a little more advanced but you can you can design it in such a way that it actually explains things in a way that's more fluid and more easy to understand that even if you were sitting in front of that person and showing them the papers you know so I think when you do that this is the kind of thing that that then people come in the door that they come in as a lead or maybe they become a customer they start getting this communication but it is you and I think that's the part of off folks overlook is like they're not going to be to just get an email with this text in it that that could have been written by anybody they're actually listening to you they're watching you there as far as their brain knows they're sitting there across the table from you while you explain all of this to them you know so it's building the relationship so you're helping them they appreciate that you're informing them this is the the smoothest real estate transaction they've ever been involved in but they're also getting to know you and so it's it's almost and I'll tell you I experienced this myself all the time now it's a little weird then when you meet that person because they know you there's it's called the parasocial relationship they already have a relationship with you as far as their brain knows they've talked to you several times already and and that's all going to be there you know so so once you do that on a regular basis for a few months like don't don't be surprised that a lot of these folks come in and they're much friendlier they're much more comfortable you know they're not at all considering working with another agent anymore like they've already hired you in their head and and just talk about I mean you're going to find a better fit you're going to have more of the right people choose to hire you you're going to have higher lead conversion transactions are going to a lot smoother I mean just just so many different things and then one additional part I'll just sort of throw into there is I really like these are all pre-recorded right so that's great you know tell me about the process but if you ever run into something that's especially like frustrating or has a lot of emotion to it that's where you really want to use video right so if you're going to share bad news like oh they didn't accept the offer you know that sort of thing record a video message because the empathy is substantially higher on video right so they can you know so even even phone calls you could call somebody but them watching your face and seeing your facial expressions and being able to read that empathy on your face that does still go much further so I think that's another place you can incorporate it to really you know maximize that that sort of sense of hey this person has the basis covered they're totally in control I can trust them completely and that I mean just in terms of the the enjoyable ability so to speak of the process and working with your customers it really helps Wow I mean we're almost talking a little bit of kind of a mini revolution here in communication like change Oh yeah like we're really talking about one to one video communication whether it's pre-recorded or live there is something that activates and lights up our brain and makes us feel connected to the other person and through repetition whether it's again whether it's pre-recorded or live you start the brain starts to sort of build these neural pathways of familiarity so all of a sudden we're like oh I know I know I know Nick I see Nick all the time he's familiar to me which familiar means comfortable which means non-threatening which is which is typically a gateway to the ability to sell somebody something right so trust we're now talking about you know no liking trust and I think you're you're really on the cusp of this and agents that can start to move away from the and not that there's anything wrong with texting if that's appropriate for a relationship great but you can pepper in like I love the idea of the bad news video message so let's do a real like a a use case example so I'm a REALTOR my client loses this bit that they put in this this offered bio home I have to give them bad news now would you recommend I do that live video would you recommend a pre-recorded video what do you think is is and again it could be anything every relationship different but what's a general rule of thumb on something like that yeah I mean I think that one's that one's gonna depend on the customer a little bit I think it depends on sort of you know the question the difference between those two is that when you when you try to get on like a video chat with them you're interrupting them so it's like a phone call that's one of the disadvantage of phone calls they have to answer and you're disrupting their day and they might not be they might not be in a place where physically they want to be seen right yeah they might not want to be on camera you know they might not feel you know so but that being said depending on the type of client like they might prefer that because they want to ask questions they want to you know they want to be able to dig in a little bit on it on the other hand if you pre-record it they can watch it at any time you can be succinct you can get straight to the point you know you can get right to the news right off the bat so it really just depends on how the previous communication has been going right so I think the the thing to look at there is like is this somebody who calls you you know do they like having a lot of conversations on the phone if you've done zoom meetings with them in that case I would say hey would you mind hopping on zoom for a couple minutes I want to give you an update on on the situation here right sure and again that's one where you want to get to it quick because you don't want them you know waiting for for hours to to get that info on the other hand if it's somebody who's been doing a lot of texting with you or things like email which are you know we call it a synchronous right so it's something you can watch at any time it doesn't have to happen right at that moment then a pre-recorded message is probably going to be better for them I love that too and at the end of a pre-recorded message you can always say I'm going to call you in a couple hours to just to check in on you as well but I wanted I didn't want to wait for this I didn't want to wait a couple hours I wanted to get make get this information over to you immediately um that is that's huge all of this all of this is huge and and I guess at the end of the day it demonstrates care concern effort whether it's warranted or not is another conversation meaning for some reason our our physicality are the way that we are built as humans we just like that we just like getting one-on-one videos I mean it's just kind of how it how we're wired so if forget about anything other than it just it used to be it felt good to get and it still does feels good to get a handwritten letter those are pretty much done uh now although I still think that that is an amazing thing but what's taken its place is these one-to-one videos I think and they're still very rare so if you can make a one-to-one video process again start with birthdays start with home anniversaries start with you know uh I hope your kids are going doing well uh when they're going back to school this fall you know whatever could be it's your kids birthday happy birthday whatever you need to get this information um put it in and and you can do those all day long and even if you just did that if nothing else if all you did was birthdays and any other you know life event stuff that you know I bet you'd get I bet you'd get business just just from doing that uh and obviously that's like 1% of what you can actually do um and and it's to learn the other 99% um that is what Nick and his company is going to teach you so Nick tell us about about the service and uh and you know what it entails and why our listeners should be checking it out yeah I mean I think the the main thing to understand about business video school is you know it's a school for real estate agents it's about 95 percent of our students are real estate agents um and we teach pretty much all aspects of video now I will say we're not for the video expert so if you've been making video for five years and you've already got a YouTube channel with hundreds of thousands of followers that kind of stuff like you know there there's people to help you and we certainly could but that's not who we're built for we're built for the beginner so beginner and intermediate right so folks that are you know having trouble making your first video or maybe you've made a few but it hasn't become a habit everything we do is about building video habits right so um just you know kind of a quick overview of what we have included there's a lot so you don't you don't kind of come in and try to take it all at once we've got nine different courses some of which we teach live on a monthly or quarterly basis we have something called video recipes which is a script and example of us doing the video ourselves you can imitate our delivery style it's all the instructions on how to make it it's the social media posts it's any sort of assets like music that might go in the video so basically all the ingredients you need to make a video we make a new one of those every week and then we do things you know a lot of fun stuff like we have challenges every month we split up into teams kind of compete to make different themed videos we have Q&A sessions live Q&As you can come on to if you ever get stuck and then a community you know I think the community is is a big part of it it's just a bunch of folks that are it's it's very much no judgment you know so there's a lot of folks sharing I this is my first video I ever made you know what do you think and obviously there's lots of things they can improve but we're just there to encourage and when they're first getting started obviously so I think that that's really what you got to look at is that video it's a form of communication and it is going to take some time to really start to understand and implement fully so we work with folks sort of incrementally speaking so you can come in you take a class or two you work on implementing you come in with your Q&As and you need them and that's why we set it up as a membership because we felt like hey it'd be nice if it's not just a course you don't just buy something it sits on your computer and you got nobody to talk to like we wanted to have that community and have the the support the ability to come in and kind of get your questions answered and that's what it comes down to you know so so a video is is a concern you know if it's something that you want to do more with I strongly recommend you come check us out and obviously it's one of those things that the sooner you do it the more benefit you're going to get because it is only increasing more and more people are doing this
