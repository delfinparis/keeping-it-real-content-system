[00:01:14] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:17] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:21] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:23] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:26] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:28] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:31] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:32] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:35] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:39] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:41] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:46] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:49] and I've hired over 2,000 agents.
[00:01:51] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:54] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:55] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:01:58] for each agent in your market
[00:02:00] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:04] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:05] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:08] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:10] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:12] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:15] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:18] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:20] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:22] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:24] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:27] corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:02:52] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real,
[00:02:56] the largest podcast made by real estate agents
[00:02:58] and for real estate agents.
[00:03:00] My name is DJ Paras, I'm your guide
[00:03:02] and host through the show.
[00:03:04] And yes, this is my real voice.
[00:03:06] I just had a conversation with an agent
[00:03:09] who is a listener of our mind
[00:03:10] and she goes, I can't believe you actually sound like that.
[00:03:13] So I do.
[00:03:14] And in just a moment, you're going to be hearing
[00:03:16] the same voice, interviewing the great Scott Spellker,
[00:03:19] a number one agent in New Jersey in his area
[00:03:23] and it's a really great conversation.
[00:03:25] He gives so many amazing tips.
[00:03:27] I can't wait for you to hear it.
[00:03:28] I promise it's one of the better episodes
[00:03:30] we've done in our seven year history.
[00:03:32] But before we get to Scott, just a quick reminder.
[00:03:34] First of all, if you're new to this podcast, thank you.
[00:03:37] We appreciate you being here.
[00:03:38] I am here to serve you, help you get to actually hear
[00:03:42] from these top producers that you might see in your area
[00:03:44] and maybe you don't have connection to.
[00:03:46] You don't have access to.
[00:03:47] I have access to them.
[00:03:48] And by the way, if there is somebody in your area
[00:03:51] that you don't have access to,
[00:03:52] that you're like, how does that person do that?
[00:03:54] Reach out to me.

[00:04:07] Give us your guest requests.
[00:04:09] We get so many guest pitches,
[00:04:11] but maybe they're not who you want, right?
[00:04:13] Maybe they're, you have somebody like I said
[00:04:15] in your local market that you want to know.
[00:04:17] Bring them to us.
[00:04:18] We will get them on the show.
[00:04:19] Thank you for sharing this with other agents in your office.
[00:04:22] We know tons of agents that listen to this
[00:04:24] as part of their sales meetings.
[00:04:25] That really means a lot to us.
[00:04:27] Let us know those stories.
[00:04:28] We appreciate you.
[00:04:29] All right, guys, let's get right to it.
[00:04:30] My conversation with Scott Spellker.
[00:04:32] [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪
[00:04:47] Best advice you have received in real estate.
[00:04:50] That's the best advice I've been receiving in the state.
[00:04:52] And I guess we're going to go with their worst advice, too.
[00:04:56] You know, I'd say the best advice I probably got.
[00:05:02] Was that you really had to kind of brand yourself in some way.
[00:05:09] Kind of figure out, it takes a little time.
[00:05:10] Figure out who you're going to be.
[00:05:15] And I talked to different real estate agents
[00:05:18] and try to get a feel for, what was the thing that was going to
[00:05:21] kind of really resonate with me?
[00:05:23] And I guess the word was trust.
[00:05:25] It just kept coming back to that word of trust.
[00:05:27] And how important it is to have somebody
[00:05:29] you're working with that you trust.
[00:05:31] But along with that advice, they said, you know,
[00:05:34] in addition to branding and you want to really,
[00:05:37] for lack of a better word, put yourself out there.
[00:05:41] So sometimes it's a little bit hard because it doesn't feel
[00:05:44] genuine when you're joining clubs, you know,
[00:05:47] basically to meet people and to kind of meet new people
[00:05:51] to be able to sell real estate.
[00:05:52] But I didn't really do that as much.
[00:05:56] But the point is the same.
[00:05:58] You've got to be out there.
[00:05:59] You can't be holed up in your house,
[00:06:01] in your basement, meeting nobody.
[00:06:04] As I told my wife, when I go golfing several times a week
[00:06:08] in the nice weather that I'm working on client relations,
[00:06:11] and she's like, you're going golfing.
[00:06:13] And I was like, well, how do you know that you can call it that?
[00:06:15] But I have to tell you, there's a lot of people
[00:06:17] that you play with over time.
[00:06:19] And you just got to build a rapport.
[00:06:22] For me, it's golf.
[00:06:25] You build a rapport that I have no doubt
[00:06:27] that the time comes to sell their house.
[00:06:29] I'm going to be probably the first game in the list
[00:06:31] because there's just a relationship that's built up
[00:06:35] through something that I just enjoy doing.
[00:06:37] That's playing golf.
[00:06:39] So that's part of it.
[00:06:40] Part of it is, you know, if you're active, maybe, you know,
[00:06:42] you're, I don't know, a girl scout mom
[00:06:45] or maybe you're a baseball coach or you're a cheerleader
[00:06:48] coach or a dance instructor or your talent council,
[00:06:52] whatever it is, people just need to see you out there.
[00:06:56] And I don't go up to them and basically,
[00:06:58] so they run the other way when they see me
[00:07:00] and want to talk to them about real estate all the time.
[00:07:02] You don't want to be that person.
[00:07:03] But they'll know who you are.
[00:07:05] They'll know that you do real estate.
[00:07:06] And I think it's important to advertise,
[00:07:08] especially in the beginning.
[00:07:10] You want to advertise, get your name out there.
[00:07:12] I mean, I used to do open houses
[00:07:14] and I branded my open house signs.
[00:07:17] I caught a lot of flack with some of the other agents.
[00:07:19] They didn't think, you know, you can't do that.
[00:07:21] Managers like, yeah, not only can you do it,
[00:07:23] I've encouraged you all to do it.
[00:07:25] And he's the only one that bought his own signs.
[00:07:27] So brand your signs.
[00:07:29] And then what I would do is I would have an open house
[00:07:32] on, you know, some street.
[00:07:34] And most people put out like, you know,
[00:07:36] a sign in the corner or maybe one down the next corner.
[00:07:39] I would put a dozen signs out.
[00:07:42] Sometimes stretching from main street in my town
[00:07:46] to the next town.
[00:07:48] It was along the same road,
[00:07:49] but I would have friends at the time
[00:07:51] were like, hey, I want to come by, visit you at your open house.
[00:07:53] Where is this thing?
[00:07:54] I've been driving for three miles.
[00:07:56] I wanted people like anywhere they drove
[00:07:58] to see my real estate sign because I was trying to project
[00:08:03] like I was doing way more business
[00:08:04] maybe than I was when I first joined.
[00:08:07] So buy a lot of signs and you do open houses
[00:08:10] and put them everywhere.
[00:08:12] Technically, you have to take them down by a certain time,
[00:08:14] but sometimes I would forget.
[00:08:17] And it would be there for the morning rush hour
[00:08:19] for people to see as well.
[00:08:22] But yeah, so I guess there's a long way of saying,
[00:08:25] you know, get yourself out, put yourself out there.
[00:08:27] Interact.
[00:08:27] Don't be a secret agent.
[00:08:29] Yeah, don't be a secret agent.
[00:08:31] Interact with other people.
[00:08:32] And preferably in things that you enjoy.
[00:08:36] And more often than not, you're going to see
[00:08:38] that people are going to bring up real estate to you.
[00:08:41] I'm never the one that brings it up.
[00:08:43] I never bring it up on the gockboards.
[00:08:44] I don't bring it up at parties, social situations.
[00:08:49] I don't not talk about it.
[00:08:51] You know, there's a house, the market,
[00:08:52] that's the market.
[00:08:53] So yeah, you know, I'll have a conversation with them about it,
[00:08:55] but I just don't want to be that guy
[00:08:58] that you're going away from because all he wants to do
[00:09:00] is ask if you want to sell your house.
[00:09:01] But so that would be the best advice I got, I suppose.
[00:09:04] The worst advice, and it's not that bad.
[00:09:07] But you know, as somebody that, you know, I had,
[00:09:12] was really trying to get going quickly.
[00:09:14] I'm not a patient person.
[00:09:15] I worked on Wall Street for 25 years as a trader.
[00:09:19] Everything was very quickly.
[00:09:21] And you know, everything happened on a warp speed.
[00:09:25] So the advice was listen, just be patient.
[00:09:28] It's going to take five to six years
[00:09:30] before you really start getting any traction in this business.
[00:09:35] And I think if I took that advice,
[00:09:37] I probably would have just kind of sat back
[00:09:40] and maybe taken the small amount of money
[00:09:43] that the company, and the office gives you for marketing.
[00:09:46] A lot of people didn't even use the market.
[00:09:48] They gave us like $200 a month for,
[00:09:51] that you could use for a mailers and stuff.
[00:09:53] And I was amazed at how many people did not even use
[00:09:57] the free money to send out mailers.
[00:10:00] So I decided, listen, five or six years
[00:10:02] are not going to do it for me.
[00:10:03] But the other was the advice.
[00:10:06] Five or six years and, you know, learn from the ropes
[00:10:10] and maybe you should join a team first
[00:10:12] and learn this business that way.
[00:10:15] And I think for some people maybe,
[00:10:17] if you're not a self-starter, it's not a bad way to go.
[00:10:20] But I was like, yeah, no.
[00:10:21] The first year, I made $50,000.
[00:10:27] And I spent $45,000.
[00:10:32] I would say probably 10 of it was, you know,
[00:10:34] videos and photography and expenses and stuff.
[00:10:36] But the other 35,000 was on marketing.
[00:10:40] And then the next year, just for round numbers,
[00:10:43] we'll say, you did $100,000 and I spent $50,000.
[00:10:46] Well, my wife says, you're gonna work,
[00:10:48] you're gonna work over two years, you make $55,000.
[00:10:51] She says like $27,500 a year.
[00:10:54] You can make a lot of work for not a lot of money.
[00:10:55] I said, I'm like Amazon, I'm building a base here.
[00:10:59] It's all revenue right now, no profits.
[00:11:02] Yeah.
[00:11:03] But I threw a lot of money into the business,
[00:11:05] whether it's the brochure at our church in town
[00:11:09] when people were recognizing this time, 50 years.
[00:11:11] But the diner, you go from church to take the kids
[00:11:14] to the diner and there I am in a place.
[00:11:16] Then you go to hit golf balls at the driving range
[00:11:19] or play miniatures, golf, I have to do it on there again.
[00:11:22] I mean, just all over the place.
[00:11:25] And you go to the recreation field
[00:11:28] for your kids football, soccer, lacrosse game, whatever.
[00:11:32] There I am again.
[00:11:33] So it was just, you know, people say,
[00:11:35] is it worth the money to advertise?
[00:11:37] Can you do a course benefit ratio?
[00:11:40] And I'm like, I have no idea.
[00:11:42] I mean, for the longest time I thought
[00:11:44] the church full of him was probably kind of a complete waste of time.
[00:11:48] I advertised here because them and my mother would say to me,
[00:11:50] did you go to church this weekend?
[00:11:52] I would say, yeah, I go to church every weekend.
[00:11:54] And she goes, no, you don't.
[00:11:54] I didn't see you in churches.
[00:11:55] We've been, I said, look, I go to every single mess.
[00:11:58] And she says, oh, you're lying now.
[00:12:00] And I said, I'm in the bulletin.
[00:12:02] And that's technically I'm in church.
[00:12:04] So I was going to stop advertising after a couple of years
[00:12:07] in the church bulletin.
[00:12:09] And at one time I got a phone call from a guy
[00:12:12] like on a Monday afternoon, I'm driving to town
[00:12:15] and I'm thinking, as real estate agents,
[00:12:16] anybody listening to us will know that we get calls.
[00:12:19] We have to answer our phone because you never know.
[00:12:22] It could be, you know, somebody wants to sell a house,
[00:12:25] a buy a house.
[00:12:25] So more often than not, it's some nonsense call.
[00:12:29] And you're just like, for a while there,
[00:12:31] they were selling it.
[00:12:32] Was it car warranties or something?
[00:12:36] They would get me like three times a day with them.
[00:12:38] So anyway, I pick up the phone on a Monday afternoon
[00:12:40] and it turns out this guy and he says, listen,
[00:12:42] I'm thinking about selling my house.
[00:12:43] I was like, well, you know, when you would
[00:12:45] like to get together because what are you doing right now?
[00:12:47] And I was like, I'll be there in five minutes.
[00:12:50] Put his house on the market four days later.
[00:12:52] And I said, you know, why did you, you give me a call?
[00:12:55] Why did you pick us?
[00:12:56] He said, you know, I heard a lot of good things about you
[00:12:59] from my kids school, you know, some of the parents.
[00:13:02] And then I was in church and I've kind of bored at the end
[00:13:05] and I'm flipping through the bullets in.
[00:13:06] The church bulletin, I see your face there
[00:13:09] and it says something like 50 year parishioner
[00:13:11] or something, he goes, this is my guy.
[00:13:14] So the church bulletin actually got me that listing
[00:13:18] and then he referred me to somebody else.
[00:13:20] Between the two of them is about a $4 million worth
[00:13:23] of real estate, which is, you know, whatever,
[00:13:25] call it two and a half percent, $100,000 before my split.
[00:13:30] But a pretty serious amount of money.
[00:13:32] So the next year when the salesperson called me
[00:13:35] where they wanted to stay with the church bulletin
[00:13:38] and pay them whatever, $1,400, I'm like,
[00:13:40] there's no way I can cancel this.
[00:13:42] Not because I think I'm gonna get additional business,
[00:13:44] but I was so blessed to get any sort of return on that
[00:13:49] after five years and putting out $7,000
[00:13:51] I'm thinking that was a complete waste of money.
[00:13:54] So the point is advertise, invest in yourself,
[00:13:57] get your name out there as much as you can.
[00:13:59] You're never gonna know exactly which is the one
[00:14:02] is the reason you got the listing,
[00:14:03] but at the end of the day, you've got to put that money
[00:14:06] back in and I looked it at this way, look,
[00:14:07] if I put $20,000, which is a ton of money
[00:14:10] compared to what most agents were spent.
[00:14:12] Around here, that's the equivalent of, you know,
[00:14:14] if you get a listing that's ish, I don't know,
[00:14:16] a million dollars, okay, it's not quite,
[00:14:19] but maybe it's two listings of $700,000.
[00:14:21] So it's a little bit of work.
[00:14:23] I mean, that work that you do in those two listings
[00:14:26] and you're throwing it right back into the business,
[00:14:27] but I mean, you just have to do it.
[00:14:31] If you wanna have kind of a decent amount of business
[00:14:36] coming in, and the more business you have coming in
[00:14:39] makes you, how do I describe this?
[00:14:43] All right, you know when you go to a bar,
[00:14:45] we're gonna go off the rails here.
[00:14:48] So I gotta go back, I'm 62,
[00:14:49] I gotta spend a while, of course,
[00:14:51] it's been many, many years since I've been at a bar,
[00:14:53] but you're gonna go to a bar and you're a single guy
[00:14:57] and we all know that we've all been there.
[00:14:59] And it applies to women of church, you know,
[00:15:01] but you go to a bar and you're hoping to meet somebody, right?
[00:15:04] Hope it to meet somebody and they can smell the desperation.
[00:15:08] So nothing's happened, right?
[00:15:11] Meanwhile, if you had just started dating somebody,
[00:15:13] maybe a couple of weeks before,
[00:15:15] you're kind of seeing each other,
[00:15:16] then when you go to the bar,
[00:15:18] all of a sudden, it's like you can't miss.
[00:15:21] All these girls won't hold anything in,
[00:15:23] like what's the difference?
[00:15:24] It's the same with real estate in this sense that
[00:15:26] when you have quite a bit of business going on,
[00:15:29] you don't reap of desperation,
[00:15:31] you're a little bit more relaxed, a little bit more calm,
[00:15:34] a little bit more self-assured,
[00:15:36] not desperate that you're gonna make a mistaken
[00:15:38] and worrying so much about what comes out of your mouth
[00:15:41] with the listing presentation on my God,
[00:15:44] and should I say, you know, this word or should I say that word?
[00:15:47] And then you're just uptight.
[00:15:49] So it's, you know, maybe it's not a great analogy,
[00:15:51] but I think you understand where I'm coming from.
[00:15:53] It's if you have some business going on,
[00:15:56] it's gonna allow you to be a little bit more flexible
[00:15:59] and a little bit more at ease,
[00:16:01] and that is actually gonna lead to more business
[00:16:03] because nobody wants to be sold anything.
[00:16:06] You know, when you go to a department store,
[00:16:08] you go into this store and you see the person coming over
[00:16:11] and you're worse.
[00:16:12] It's the worst, right?
[00:16:14] All they're gonna do is say, you know,
[00:16:15] can I help you with anything?
[00:16:16] It's harmless.
[00:16:17] They're not really, they're not all over you.
[00:16:19] Just them coming over, I'm like, oh God,
[00:16:21] can I hide behind the sweater section?
[00:16:23] Because I don't wanna talk to anybody.
[00:16:25] That's the same thing I think you get a lot of times
[00:16:27] your real estate with, like, you know,
[00:16:29] even if I'm in an open house, you know,
[00:16:32] you gotta give them some space.
[00:16:33] Sometimes they, they're more likely to come up to you
[00:16:35] if you say, hey, listen, you have any questions
[00:16:36] with the house, the paperwork's over there.
[00:16:38] Happy to give you the help you, blah, blah, blah,
[00:16:40] let them see the house.
[00:16:42] You know, won't be, you know,
[00:16:44] change where you guys from.
[00:16:45] You guys have an agent, you know,
[00:16:47] nobody wants to be sold anything.
[00:16:48] Let them feel like, it'd be a privilege,
[00:16:50] like you're good enough that you don't need to do that.
[00:16:54] So, you know, that's a long way of saying
[00:16:57] us some of the advice I got.
[00:16:58] You can cut that piece up as many of which ways to say it.
[00:17:01] Oh, we will not cut a moment.
[00:17:03] We will not be cutting a moment of that
[00:17:05] because everything you said was amazing.
[00:17:10] It's really exactly the advice that lots of other people
[00:17:14] that have come on our show have given in bits and pieces.
[00:17:17] You gave a lot of it right up front.
[00:17:20] This is the very first few minutes of the show
[00:17:22] and I cannot thank you enough
[00:17:24] because you were very thoughtful and intentional
[00:17:26] in your answers and our audience was taking notes.
[00:17:29] They're listening, they're going to go back and re-listen
[00:17:31] because there's so much given there
[00:17:32] and we could really stop the interview right now
[00:17:34] and just call it a day
[00:17:35] and that would make me very happy with the content
[00:17:38] but we're going to do more of course.
[00:17:40] But let's, in fact, I want to say before we introduce Scott
[00:17:44] which we haven't even done yet,
[00:17:45] I want to say this is the reason why I do this show
[00:17:47] and I am, I've been doing this for seven years
[00:17:50] and this is not new for me and people say,
[00:17:52] boy, it must be a grind and yeah,
[00:17:54] I guess to some degree, everything that's worthwhile
[00:17:56] is a grind.
[00:17:57] But I get to meet people like Scott
[00:17:59] and this is really exciting for me
[00:18:01] because I really like Scott
[00:18:02] and we just met minutes before, but I really like him
[00:18:05] and I'm really so blessed, you talked about being blessed,
[00:18:09] you talked about playing golf
[00:18:11] and you're right, you're spending four hours with somebody
[00:18:14] playing 18 holes or whatever you're playing
[00:18:17] and you're developing a relationship with them
[00:18:20] and especially if you go to a golf course by yourself,
[00:18:24] they're going to pair you with somebody
[00:18:25] so you're definitely going to meet somebody new.
[00:18:27] But I get to do that on this show
[00:18:28] and I'm so grateful for it
[00:18:29] because I get to meet cool people like Scott
[00:18:31] who have been in this business a long time,
[00:18:33] Scott comes from a Wall Street previously
[00:18:35] and his career will talk about that in a moment
[00:18:37] but I get to meet people like Scott
[00:18:39] which is so fortunate for me
[00:18:40] because even though I'm not out there practicing as an agent
[00:18:43] which would make more sense for me doing the show
[00:18:45] if I was but our audience gets to benefit from that
[00:18:49] but I also get to meet people like this
[00:18:51] who are inspiring to me.
[00:18:52] So let's bring them on.
[00:18:54] So Scott's already here of course,
[00:18:55] Scott Spellker is who we're chatting with,
[00:18:57] he's from the Spellker team with Coldwell Banker
[00:18:59] in Madison, New Jersey, which is about 30 minutes
[00:19:02] or so west of Manhattan
[00:19:04] and in a really fun part of New Jersey
[00:19:07] I have spent some time around that area
[00:19:09] back when I used to work for Anaheiser Bush
[00:19:10] and we were touring around.
[00:19:12] But let's talk more about Scott.
[00:19:13] Scott is married to his life and business partner
[00:19:16] Amy Spellker for 37 years
[00:19:18] met at Dickinson College.
[00:19:19] They, he majored in economics went directly to Wall Street
[00:19:22] where he became a foreign exchange trader, Forex
[00:19:25] which is what you hear a lot about these days of course
[00:19:27] but certainly not an easy thing to do.
[00:19:30] After 25 year career,
[00:19:31] Scott went into real estate and has been doing that
[00:19:33] for the last 11 years.
[00:19:35] He's active in his community.
[00:19:36] He's served on several boards, boards, boards of directors.
[00:19:40] He is, he volunteers, he gives back.
[00:19:42] He's coached youth league baseball
[00:19:44] and football for a combined 35 years
[00:19:47] and has also coached the Madison High School
[00:19:49] of RC tennis team.
[00:19:50] I am a tennis player as well.
[00:19:52] I appreciate that for three years.
[00:19:54] Scott and Amy have three sons and a granddaughter.
[00:19:56] They both love to travel domestically internationally.
[00:19:59] Scott's other hobbies include playing golf
[00:20:01] as he mentioned and reading.
[00:20:02] And what everybody to follow Scott and his team
[00:20:05] at Spellker, NJ Homes, he is in New Jersey.
[00:20:08] So Spellker, NJ Homes on Instagram
[00:20:11] and you can find him.
[00:20:12] He's easy to find.
[00:20:13] You go to his church, he's in the Bolton.
[00:20:14] So easy to find.
[00:20:16] Scott, welcome, welcome to the show.
[00:20:18] We were so grateful to have you.
[00:20:19] Thanks for having me.
[00:20:20] Yeah, let's talk about, so I'm curious about the move
[00:20:23] from Wall Street to real estate.
[00:20:26] Very different, obviously different,
[00:20:29] well, maybe not a different skill set.
[00:20:31] I'm not sure.
[00:20:32] We have the board of exchange here
[00:20:34] in the mercantile exchange here
[00:20:35] and the options exchange here in Chicago.
[00:20:38] So I know a little bit of that world.
[00:20:39] I've never quite understood trading interest rates
[00:20:42] and things like that, which are always confusing to me.
[00:20:45] When I ask traders, do you want things to go up or down?
[00:20:47] They're like, we just want movement.
[00:20:49] We don't really care where it comes.
[00:20:50] We're just like, okay, that's hard for me to wrap my mind around.
[00:20:52] But anyway, you did this for a long time in New York
[00:20:55] and a very fast-paced environment.
[00:20:58] You saw a lot of change in the technology
[00:20:59] at Wall Street, of course, over that time.
[00:21:02] But curious, what prompted the change
[00:21:04] from Wall Street to real estate?
[00:21:08] Well, there's a, we got to throw it
[00:21:10] a little bit of failure in there first.
[00:21:12] Because it's, would you listen
[00:21:13] and somebody talk about yourself
[00:21:14] or whatever, you know, what your background is?
[00:21:17] You're kind of like, oh, enough already about this guy.
[00:21:21] And meanwhile, that guy is me.
[00:21:24] There's a lot of bloodsooting tears
[00:21:26] and a lot of failure that we need to point out here.
[00:21:30] So I did go right to Wall Street
[00:21:31] and everybody came before me.
[00:21:34] I was working for a commercial bank
[00:21:35] and usually within six months,
[00:21:36] you got a chance to start trading.
[00:21:38] It took me two years.
[00:21:39] I was getting breakfast for everybody, lunch, coffee.
[00:21:44] It was like pledging a fraternity for the first two years.
[00:21:48] And eventually, I got my shot
[00:21:51] and I had a fairly successful career.
[00:21:53] It was absolute mayhem in the 80s and 90s.
[00:21:57] And you're sitting in a trading room
[00:21:58] of either a bank or investment bank
[00:22:00] and essentially everybody had their own currency.
[00:22:03] That was based on how good you were.
[00:22:05] And the bank is letting you make bets
[00:22:08] with their money to make more money.
[00:22:11] So if I thought the euro was gonna go higher,
[00:22:15] I'd buy five million euros, 10 million euros,
[00:22:17] 50 million euros,
[00:22:18] and sometimes it would only go up a little bit
[00:22:20] and you'd make 10 grand, 20 grand,
[00:22:22] but it went up a lot of it.
[00:22:23] You might make 500 grand.
[00:22:24] So the more money you made for them,
[00:22:27] the more money you got paid at the end of the year,
[00:22:29] it's not that they paid you.
[00:22:29] It wasn't commissioned either.
[00:22:30] It wasn't sales.
[00:22:32] It was trading.
[00:22:33] It was basically making bets.
[00:22:35] And if you were good at it,
[00:22:35] you got paid well and if you didn't, you got fired.
[00:22:38] And the reason I left after 25 years
[00:22:41] was kind of what you alluded to before.
[00:22:43] There wasn't as much action.
[00:22:45] The grant, and 25 years later I was 47, 48.
[00:22:49] You think you'd be a little bit burned out by then,
[00:22:50] but when there was a lot of movement,
[00:22:53] a lot of action to date just flew.
[00:22:55] But what happened is once the euro came around,
[00:22:57] it used to be many more currencies
[00:22:59] than the euro came around in 1999.
[00:23:01] But the volatility kind of went out of it after,
[00:23:04] I mean, there was a little bit of volatility
[00:23:05] in a way during the financial crisis,
[00:23:06] but it was like watching paint dry.
[00:23:08] You traded a little bit to 11 o'clock
[00:23:10] in the morning when London went home
[00:23:11] and then you basically sat around until five or six o'clock
[00:23:15] at night.
[00:23:15] And I got bored.
[00:23:16] I just really got bored.
[00:23:17] I just didn't want to do it anymore.
[00:23:19] So this is where the failure comes in.
[00:23:21] I went back to school at night
[00:23:24] to the College of St. Elizabeth,
[00:23:26] close by to where I live in Madison
[00:23:28] and they had an alternate root teaching program.
[00:23:31] My brother had done it years before
[00:23:33] when he was 32 or something
[00:23:35] and I'm doing this at 48 at the time.
[00:23:38] And so I went back to school to become a teacher.
[00:23:40] I wanted to teach US history,
[00:23:42] world history, economics, and sort of thing.
[00:23:44] I figured I could coach as well.
[00:23:46] And I went through the program
[00:23:48] and student taught at a local high school
[00:23:50] by all accounts I wasn't terrible.
[00:23:54] Kind of more scary going up against,
[00:23:57] up against, but in front of,
[00:23:59] second semester seniors that have already mailed it in.
[00:24:03] And I've got to talk to them about
[00:24:04] sociology and world history
[00:24:07] without boring them to tears.
[00:24:08] More frightening, I would say,
[00:24:10] then when I played quarterback in college
[00:24:11] and getting hit by an outside linebacker
[00:24:13] and more frightening than trading on Wall Street.
[00:24:17] It was wrong, I guess these kids.
[00:24:19] At the time though, when I graduated,
[00:24:21] there were probably, you know,
[00:24:23] I don't know, maybe 50 people in our class
[00:24:24] and like only four of them were able to get full-time jobs.
[00:24:28] So every time we applied for positions,
[00:24:30] there were like 300 applications.
[00:24:32] So I wasn't able to get hired.
[00:24:34] I did some long-term service,
[00:24:35] but after three years, I couldn't land a teaching job.
[00:24:39] So I left the previous career,
[00:24:41] go to become a teacher,
[00:24:42] I failed miserably at securing a job.
[00:24:45] Pretty low point in my life, to be honest with you.
[00:24:49] Nothing ever came easy to me.
[00:24:51] I mean, everything I did,
[00:24:52] I had to work pretty hard for it.
[00:24:54] And this I didn't work hard for,
[00:24:55] but nobody would give me a chance.
[00:24:57] So that was a bit disappointing.
[00:24:59] And it was a little bit, you know,
[00:25:00] I was definitely down for a while,
[00:25:02] not just financially,
[00:25:02] but I was also like really bummed out.
[00:25:04] I had no purpose.
[00:25:06] And it was too young to be,
[00:25:07] 48, 49 years was a big retired.
[00:25:09] So everybody said,
[00:25:10] I'll be sure you go into real estate.
[00:25:12] And I struggled with that because,
[00:25:14] I don't know, I just felt like it wasn't for me.
[00:25:19] But I ended up taking the test, passed it.
[00:25:21] And I said, you know, if I don't like it,
[00:25:23] I'll just quit.
[00:25:24] I'm not walking away from a Wall Street career,
[00:25:26] I can walk away from real estate.
[00:25:30] And the first, I really didn't want anything
[00:25:31] to be that competitive.
[00:25:32] You know, my previous career on Wall Street
[00:25:34] was so competitive.
[00:25:35] And that's why the thought of teaching appealed to me,
[00:25:39] you know, to coach people in education,
[00:25:42] making excited about learning,
[00:25:44] about history even.
[00:25:46] And that really appealed to me.
[00:25:47] And there's no competition.
[00:25:48] I go to my competition with the social studies teacher
[00:25:50] across the whole.
[00:25:51] I mean, I'm just, I can do my own thing
[00:25:53] and not have to compete.
[00:25:54] I don't want to compete anymore.
[00:25:56] So I ended up going into real estate
[00:25:58] and thinking,
[00:26:00] this is not a competitive,
[00:26:01] it's not competitive,
[00:26:02] it's just your own thing.
[00:26:03] And it's just going to be like being a teacher.
[00:26:05] Within, I'd say six months,
[00:26:08] I came home one day and my wife said,
[00:26:10] something different about you.
[00:26:11] And I said, I'm back.
[00:26:13] Excuse me, what did we need to back?
[00:26:15] That's it, I'm back.
[00:26:16] And she just looked in my eyes.
[00:26:18] She knew exactly what I meant.
[00:26:20] Back to being that kind of very, very competitive
[00:26:23] Wall Street person, not the person
[00:26:25] that's been offered the last two or three years,
[00:26:27] kind of in, you know,
[00:26:28] professorial mode, going to be a teacher.
[00:26:31] And so I became very competitive about it
[00:26:34] and went all in.
[00:26:36] I don't do anything kind of part way.
[00:26:37] Is I'm either all in or I'm not?
[00:26:40] So, yeah, you know, on the road to,
[00:26:42] I mean, I guess I'm a fairly successful real estate person.
[00:26:46] If I was 40, I'd probably have a team of 20 people,
[00:26:48] but at 62, that doesn't appeal to me.
[00:26:51] So, yeah, I mean, I guess that a lot of bench blocks
[00:26:53] were pretty successful.
[00:26:54] I'm not all that, believe me, I'm not all that.
[00:26:57] But it's just important, I think,
[00:26:58] that people realize that, yes,
[00:27:00] you can have a second career,
[00:27:02] but my second career actually came after the one I failed
[00:27:06] at, you know, become trying to become a teacher,
[00:27:08] which really was what I wanted to do
[00:27:10] with that next stage of my life
[00:27:11] and it just didn't work out for me.
[00:27:13] But real estate has, in some respects, saved my life
[00:27:15] because, you know, I don't know how well I would have done
[00:27:19] mentally and emotionally,
[00:27:21] if I continued to have zero purpose in my life,
[00:27:24] I'm nothing to do.
[00:27:25] So, I'm grateful.
[00:27:27] I want to ask about your brand
[00:27:29] because we talked about branding,
[00:27:31] and I know trust is a big one for you.
[00:27:33] We were speaking about that before we started,
[00:27:35] and trust is the great one.
[00:27:37] I think if that's anybody's brand,
[00:27:40] I think that's a pretty good choice for a brand,
[00:27:42] not that it has to be just one thing.
[00:27:44] But can you talk about what trust means to you
[00:27:46] and how you go about thinking about how to demonstrate that,
[00:27:50] right?
[00:27:51] Because, of course, everybody wants to be trusted,
[00:27:53] but there's steps to take, and there's ways to do it,
[00:27:56] and there's ways to, of course,
[00:27:57] a road trust or remove it entirely.
[00:28:00] But how do you think about trust,
[00:28:01] and how do you really establish that with your clients?
[00:28:05] That's a great question.
[00:28:08] Because, yeah, I mean, you can pay lip service to it,
[00:28:12] and you can put that on your marketing
[00:28:14] or your listing presentation.
[00:28:16] But if you don't really explain why it's important to you,
[00:28:21] it probably isn't going to mean much
[00:28:23] to the person you're talking to.
[00:28:25] So trust to me, I think,
[00:28:26] has a couple different things
[00:28:27] that I'm not going to beat into death,
[00:28:28] but part of it is you're going to trust
[00:28:30] that the people you're working with are experts in this field,
[00:28:34] beating us, and that we're competent, that we get it.
[00:28:39] You know when you come across somebody
[00:28:40] where you're interfacing with them,
[00:28:42] it could be through work or you're a sales thing,
[00:28:44] or you're trying to buy something online,
[00:28:46] or on a phone, wherever,
[00:28:47] and you're talking to the other person,
[00:28:50] and they just get it.
[00:28:52] It's quick, it's seamless.
[00:28:54] So I think that's important.
[00:28:55] You can trust that you have people
[00:28:57] that you're dealing with that just get it.
[00:28:59] You know, they get the fact that when you shoot them a text,
[00:29:01] they want to hear back, like now.
[00:29:04] They don't want to hear back at four hours.
[00:29:06] You can call me at 10 o'clock at night.
[00:29:08] If I'm awake, I'm going to answer that phone.
[00:29:11] And you can trust that I'm going to go that extra mile,
[00:29:13] whether that means you're calling me from four,
[00:29:15] and there's whether we just have recently even,
[00:29:18] but and you say, listen,
[00:29:20] could you check on our house tomorrow
[00:29:22] to make sure there's no water in the basement
[00:29:23] or out of town?
[00:29:25] I'm like, no, I'm not checking out at tomorrow.
[00:29:26] I'm checking out right now.
[00:29:28] And they're like, no, no, no, it's 10 o'clock at night.
[00:29:30] I'm like, listen, I still am closed.
[00:29:32] I'm going to your house right now,
[00:29:33] take a video and send it to you.
[00:29:35] So you can trust us to go there,
[00:29:36] sure, while you can trust us to be competent.
[00:29:38] But the other thing about the trust,
[00:29:39] and I do point this out,
[00:29:41] I usually put up a slide in our listening presentation,
[00:29:45] and I must have seen this something
[00:29:46] like on social media,
[00:29:47] it's like the least trusted professions
[00:29:50] in the United States.
[00:29:52] I was like, here we go.
[00:29:54] I wasn't looking towards the top
[00:29:56] when I was looking for the real estate agent.
[00:29:58] I went down towards the bottom
[00:29:59] and I worked my way up from the bottom
[00:30:00] to get that's where it's going to be.
[00:30:04] And I drove with people sometimes like,
[00:30:06] you know, I thought we would be neck and neck
[00:30:08] with the used cars,
[00:30:09] hell, skin, but the things out were a little bit higher.
[00:30:11] And listen, there's lawyers
[00:30:13] which are, you know, very highly educated people
[00:30:16] that are actually, I think, lower than real estate agents.
[00:30:18] So to me, that trust aspect,
[00:30:20] and we make a little bit of joke out of it, joke out of it.
[00:30:23] And I will say that the people that I work with,
[00:30:25] generally, not just in this office,
[00:30:26] but in this area are very professional.
[00:30:29] They really are.
[00:30:30] But that, you know, the reputation still stands.
[00:30:32] And you ask a lot of people
[00:30:33] what they think are real estate agents.
[00:30:35] They think they don't do anything for the money
[00:30:37] and the reputation, the some reputation of us.
[00:30:40] And that was one of the things that kept me
[00:30:42] from maybe going into this field because I didn't,
[00:30:45] I didn't like that aspect.
[00:30:46] And then once I did go in, I said,
[00:30:48] let me at least try to have people come out of the other side
[00:30:51] of transactions saying this guy was very professional.
[00:30:53] This is not what I expected from a real estate agent.
[00:30:56] That's nothing.
[00:30:57] So as far as the trust aspects,
[00:30:59] I will point out to some of the sellers
[00:31:02] from the listing presentation and say,
[00:31:04] look, you know, we talk about trust.
[00:31:05] There's a lot of games that a real estate agent
[00:31:08] can play that you would never know.
[00:31:10] I mean, it's all a different things, you know,
[00:31:12] and I feel an example out where, you know,
[00:31:15] okay, I have a listing for our house.
[00:31:16] We're going to keep the numbers around here.
[00:31:17] So a million dollars.
[00:31:19] And most of these people have gone on zelo at some point.
[00:31:22] I say, you know, my zest of it is, you know, $9.89.
[00:31:26] So an agent can say, well, listen,
[00:31:28] even though I think that house is, you know, maybe $11,
[00:31:30] but yeah, that zest of it looks good.
[00:31:32] Let's listed it, you know, $9.89.
[00:31:34] And by the way, I've got a buyer for your home.
[00:31:37] I'm working with several buyers.
[00:31:39] And I bring that buyer in to see your house.
[00:31:42] And I tell the buyer, I say, listen, you know,
[00:31:44] it's not even going to hit the market,
[00:31:46] but you really should ask, you should offer over asking.
[00:31:50] So instead of $9.89, come in at a million 30.
[00:31:54] And I say to this seller, listen,
[00:31:58] my buyer really loves this house.
[00:32:00] And they're going to come in at a million 30.
[00:32:02] And I'm going to cut the commission by one percentage point.
[00:32:05] So you're going to benefit by that.
[00:32:07] And if it's one point on a million 30,
[00:32:09] it's basically, what is that?
[00:32:11] 10,000, that's 1,000.
[00:32:14] No, it's 1,300.
[00:32:15] The 13,000.
[00:32:16] It's like 1,300 blocks, yeah.
[00:32:18] That's why I'm not on Wall Street or what I can.
[00:32:20] So it's saving them 1,300 bucks.
[00:32:22] And they're getting like, you know, 30, 50, 50 grand over asking.
[00:32:26] Yeah.
[00:32:27] And they'll be telling people a cocktail party,
[00:32:29] and say, oh, this agent was so good,
[00:32:30] they got me, you know, 50 grand over asking,
[00:32:32] they got me saving the commission unbelievable.
[00:32:34] And I'm like, that's like the worst thing you can do.
[00:32:38] The biggest thing is to try to get the biggest amount
[00:32:41] of exposure for your house.
[00:32:42] So maybe I did bring a bring a buyer,
[00:32:45] but I'm exposing this house to everybody.
[00:32:46] And let's say there's four offers
[00:32:48] and it goes highest invest.
[00:32:49] And it comes in at the top offer, comes in at 1.2.
[00:32:53] So you would have left like $170,000 on the table.
[00:32:59] And that's the thing.
[00:33:00] So there's so many different examples
[00:33:03] that I can give people, usually give one or two.
[00:33:05] And they're like, I never thought about that.
[00:33:07] I said, yeah, I mean, there's different things
[00:33:08] that agents can do that there's nothing illegal about.
[00:33:11] They're not bringing you a buyer for your home.
[00:33:14] They're bringing you a number that's more than you thought
[00:33:16] you're going to get based on whatever the Zilla estimate was.
[00:33:19] They cut the commission.
[00:33:20] There's nothing illegal about it,
[00:33:22] but I just feel like you're better off putting it on the market,
[00:33:26] trying it as many people to bid on it
[00:33:28] and get you the biggest number.
[00:33:31] So that's kind of another way that trust comes in.
[00:33:34] It's not just competence.
[00:33:35] It's not just the fact that you know these people
[00:33:37] are going to be a community to go the extra distance.
[00:33:39] You can trust that we'll do that,
[00:33:41] but you also can trust that we're not going to play games.
[00:33:45] We're going to try to get to the most money for your house.
[00:33:47] Period end of story.
[00:33:49] If there's a reason why I think you shouldn't take
[00:33:52] an offer that's maybe higher than another one,
[00:33:54] I'm going to be really clear about it.
[00:33:55] But ultimately, it's not for me to make that decision.
[00:33:58] It's for me to put everything out there
[00:34:00] of some different variables in the sales.
[00:34:02] And this could happen or that could happen.
[00:34:04] You've got to live with your decision.
[00:34:05] What would I do?
[00:34:06] This is what I would do, but that doesn't mean
[00:34:07] it's right for you.
[00:34:09] So again, you're trusting that somebody is sharp.
[00:34:12] They have judgment, street smarts,
[00:34:14] that they have your back.
[00:34:17] And that's what we try to get across.
[00:34:19] And we do.
[00:34:20] I mean, you can't do it in a mailer.
[00:34:23] But what you can do is when you meet with a listing
[00:34:26] presentation and you spend a good bit of time on that.
[00:34:30] And the message comes across that you're very,
[00:34:35] you're upfront.
[00:34:36] You're honest about what you believe in.
[00:34:39] And if it's not a good fit, don't use me.
[00:34:42] I know you have a very specific opinion about
[00:34:46] mailer's, who we're talking about about this
[00:34:48] and trust, I think, is factors into this question as well.
[00:34:52] Or this topic, which is mailers that homeowners get,
[00:34:55] let's say I have a buyer ready for you.
[00:34:58] Tell us what your sort of thoughts about that.
[00:35:02] Yeah, well, I mean, I think when I first started seeing that,
[00:35:04] somebody must have come up and one of these workshops
[00:35:06] and the 1000 agents go to and they send out the
[00:35:10] have a buyer for their home.
[00:35:12] And I think probably initially it was a bunch of garbage.
[00:35:16] But as time goes on, sometimes you'll see it's very specific.
[00:35:20] They'll say, you know, Marion Joe looking for,
[00:35:23] Senator Hall Colonial, this is their price point.
[00:35:27] Totally legit.
[00:35:29] I mean, it could be absolutely legit that they have
[00:35:31] buyers in that price point.
[00:35:33] But my point is like, well, great, when you put my house
[00:35:36] on the market, assuming I choose to use you as my listing agent,
[00:35:40] and you're, it's also a way to get your foot in the door.
[00:35:42] If you say I had a buyer for your home and they contact you,
[00:35:45] do you really have a buyer for my own?
[00:35:47] Yes, maybe we should take a look at your home
[00:35:49] and we can give you an idea about your house's worth.
[00:35:51] It's basically a way to get your foot in the door.
[00:35:52] Sure.
[00:35:53] But the, again, it goes back to the other story,
[00:35:56] it's like I have a buyer for your home.
[00:35:59] And what you should be saying is I have a buyer for your home,
[00:36:02] but you shouldn't take their offer until you put it
[00:36:04] on the market and let everybody else,
[00:36:06] that's what you should say.
[00:36:07] You know what you're right?
[00:36:09] It should say that, you're right.
[00:36:10] And that should be the pitch, yeah.
[00:36:12] Yeah, so, you know, I try to get that message out to people.
[00:36:17] You know, it is effective.
[00:36:19] The, I lost out on a listing to somebody and I asked them,
[00:36:23] I said, why did you, why didn't you give us a call?
[00:36:25] And they said, well, they called me up on the phone
[00:36:28] and they said they had a buyer for our house.
[00:36:30] I was like, oh my God.
[00:36:32] Do I need to go down into the lower, lower,
[00:36:36] echelons here and start calling people
[00:36:38] and telling them a buyer, I won't do it.
[00:36:41] I mean, if I was 40, maybe I would,
[00:36:42] but I just, I don't know, it just doesn't appeal to me.
[00:36:45] It doesn't seem, it's not, it's not that sell as best interest.
[00:36:49] It doesn't feel to me genuine.
[00:36:50] It feels to me like it's a bait and switch.
[00:36:54] Yeah.
[00:36:55] I was telling you, I just,
[00:36:56] I just had a, I would say a more comfortable version
[00:37:02] of that strategy, which I think would sort of fit
[00:37:06] in an authentic way from a very, very successful agent
[00:37:10] out in Beverly Hills.
[00:37:11] And I was asking him how he got clients
[00:37:13] and he initially had started as a production assistant
[00:37:16] in the entertainment industry.
[00:37:17] And I assumed he was going to say, oh, well,
[00:37:19] you know, I built all these contacts
[00:37:20] and then I then would have been a real estate
[00:37:22] when I realized I wasn't going to get my shot
[00:37:24] to be a director.
[00:37:25] And I just kind of, you know, I had all these wealthy people
[00:37:28] that were in that business and they start working with me.
[00:37:30] He goes, no, because I didn't have that network
[00:37:32] because I was really trying to be in that industry
[00:37:34] and I wasn't there to make contacts for real estate.
[00:37:36] And then eventually I said, I gotta get a real estate.
[00:37:38] And he said, so what I did, and he did this
[00:37:41] and I thought this was really smart.
[00:37:42] And I'm curious to get your thoughts
[00:37:43] because I think it ties into what you're saying,
[00:37:45] but I think in a way that does work, which is he said,
[00:37:49] it goes, I love homes so much that I would walk around
[00:37:52] to these luxury homes that I could see pictures of them.
[00:37:54] I knew what they looked like on the inside.
[00:37:56] I fell in love with these homes.
[00:37:58] These are not homes that are on the market.
[00:37:59] These are just homes that he learned about.
[00:38:02] And he would knock on these people's doors
[00:38:03] and he would say, I am so sorry to bother you.
[00:38:06] I'm not here to sell you anything.
[00:38:07] He said, I love this house and I'm a real estate agent.
[00:38:11] And if you don't, if you could just show me
[00:38:12] a little bit of the inside, like I just want to confirm
[00:38:15] that what I think is in there is in there.
[00:38:18] And I'm not here to try to get you to list with me.
[00:38:20] You're probably not going to move anyway,
[00:38:22] but I just want to see if it matches what I think it is.
[00:38:25] And so he'd do that.
[00:38:26] He was very, very authentically doing this.
[00:38:29] And he said, everyone's flattered.
[00:38:31] When you do that, so they'd show them around
[00:38:32] and he'd go, oh my God, this is amazing.
[00:38:34] He goes, look, whenever you are thinking about selling,
[00:38:37] I don't care when it is.
[00:38:39] He goes, I want to get a crack at bringing you a buyer.
[00:38:43] You don't have to list with me, I don't care.
[00:38:45] But he goes like, I will find you a buyer for this place.
[00:38:48] And he's like, I just want an opportunity
[00:38:49] because I love this house.
[00:38:51] And he did it very authentically.
[00:38:53] And that's how he got busy.
[00:38:54] He knocked on doors and he did it that way.
[00:38:56] I never heard of anyone doing quite like that.
[00:38:58] And he's a nice guy.
[00:38:59] And he's a genuine guy.
[00:39:00] And he's an honest guy.
[00:39:01] And I thought, boy, that's a great strategy.
[00:39:03] That works.
[00:39:04] And he said, I just give him my card.
[00:39:06] And maybe two, three years later,
[00:39:07] maybe they call me, maybe they don't.
[00:39:09] He goes, but he goes, I would go to them and say,
[00:39:12] you got it, I got to see this house.
[00:39:13] This is amazing.
[00:39:14] And I thought, that's a really cool way
[00:39:16] to get in someone's favor and also possibly get a listing
[00:39:20] down the road.
[00:39:21] And he did, he would get listings that way.
[00:39:23] But he would say, my clients want places like this.
[00:39:26] I don't necessarily have one right this second,
[00:39:27] but you're not selling so it doesn't matter.
[00:39:29] But I will find you somebody.
[00:39:30] I thought that was a really cool idea.
[00:39:32] I just thought I'd bring that up.
[00:39:34] Because you, it's fun to trust.
[00:39:37] I don't have an issue with that.
[00:39:40] Listen, everybody has their way of doing this.
[00:39:44] Doesn't mean I'm right.
[00:39:45] Somebody else is wrong.
[00:39:45] I actually had zero problem with that.
[00:39:48] If it's genuine, you can't do that.
[00:39:52] And then thank you, it'll go right to the next door
[00:39:55] and knock on their door too.
[00:39:56] Right.
[00:39:57] Oh, no, no, yeah.
[00:39:58] It has to be very, right?
[00:40:00] And I think you can go to the door.
[00:40:02] Yeah, I think I can do it.
[00:40:03] Even in town of Madison, there's probably, I don't know,
[00:40:05] 10 or 20 houses that I've always thought
[00:40:07] were really beautiful houses.
[00:40:09] And some of my never been inside.
[00:40:11] So I could genuinely go up and knock on somebody's door
[00:40:13] and say, listen, I've always loved this house.
[00:40:14] I've lived here for 50 years.
[00:40:16] It was always, you know, I always figured if I hit it
[00:40:17] big on Wall Street, this would be the house I'd look to own.
[00:40:20] I could absolutely have that conversation with the seller
[00:40:23] because I truly believe it.
[00:40:25] And I was, it was only going to be a certain number of homes.
[00:40:28] Yeah, and that was just exact same philosophy too, is he works
[00:40:32] in the ultra high luxury sort of space
[00:40:34] where there aren't a ton of these homes, but, you know,
[00:40:37] he would just, just make a connection
[00:40:39] and he would stay in touch.
[00:40:40] And anyway, I want to chat because you have this
[00:40:43] really impressive finance background.
[00:40:45] And I want to talk about the Fed, because I know as REALTORS,
[00:40:49] you know, we look to the Fed oftentimes,
[00:40:51] we look at where, where what the Fed's doing with interest rates.
[00:40:54] And then we assume that there's a strict correlation
[00:40:56] between what's going to happen with the lending market.
[00:40:58] And of course, sometimes there is and sometimes there isn't.
[00:41:00] But tell me how you think about, you know,
[00:41:03] when you hear, ooh, the Fed's going to cut rates
[00:41:05] or they're going to raise rates.
[00:41:06] And does that mean anything to you?
[00:41:08] Are you, are you, does that sort of influence the way
[00:41:12] you can, you can, a conversate with clients
[00:41:15] or is it not that important for you?
[00:41:20] It's important to me because it's important
[00:41:22] to potential thoughts.
[00:41:24] If it wasn't for that, it wouldn't be very important
[00:41:27] to me at all because, first of all, when they talk about
[00:41:31] the Fed cutting interest rates, even if they cut
[00:41:35] at a 25 basis points, that means a quarter percent.
[00:41:40] If the 30 year mortgage dropped the same amount,
[00:41:44] 25 basis points, the difference in a mortgage,
[00:41:49] a 30 year mortgage from a slight decrease in the mortgage rates,
[00:41:53] is probably the equivalent of a Starbucks coffee per day.
[00:41:58] So it's not exactly moving the needle here.
[00:42:01] If you're going to get a 6% mortgage,
[00:42:02] it's at a 6 and a quarter.
[00:42:04] Oh, well, now things are going to start flying off the shelf.
[00:42:06] No, it's, it's negligible.
[00:42:08] So that's one thing about interest rates is that,
[00:42:12] just because the Fed's going to reduce interest rates
[00:42:14] is not a lock, first of all, that you're going to see
[00:42:17] if significant savings and your thing.
[00:42:20] That's not a lot.
[00:42:20] Number two, there is a fallacy that if the Fed cuts
[00:42:24] interest rates of mortgage rates automatically decline,
[00:42:27] and that is not true.
[00:42:28] And the reason for that in a nutshell is the mortgage rates
[00:42:32] are tied to the 10 year treasury bonds.
[00:42:36] Which is independent.
[00:42:38] It's not, has nothing to do with the Fed.
[00:42:40] It's been yielded on the 10 year treasury bond.
[00:42:42] It's really influenced by a whole host of factors.
[00:42:44] From inflation indicators, to sovereign wealth funds
[00:42:47] that are buying institutional, mutual funds,
[00:42:51] mom and pops that are buying T-bills and treasury bonds
[00:42:54] and stuff like that.
[00:42:55] That is really based on a lot of different factors.
[00:42:59] And so the Fed could cut interest rates
[00:43:00] and actually that 10 year yield could go up.
[00:43:05] Oh, wait a minute, you said the Fed cut rates
[00:43:06] to the yield of the bonds go down?
[00:43:09] Well, the Fed funds rates will go down,
[00:43:11] as that's what the Fed cut, but the 10 year could actually go up.
[00:43:15] If the market proceeds by the Fed cutting interest rates,
[00:43:18] if that's going to juice the economy,
[00:43:20] which can be inflationary, the 10 year and a 30 year bonds
[00:43:24] are going to be more sensitive to inflation
[00:43:27] and inflation-esque expectations
[00:43:30] than the argument the Fed is doing.
[00:43:31] So that's just something that,
[00:43:33] and it's happened in the not too just in past
[00:43:35] where the Fed has cut interest rates
[00:43:36] and the yield on the 10 year actually went higher.
[00:43:40] So this whole kind of, you know,
[00:43:41] wait for the Fed to cut,
[00:43:42] because then we're going to get rates at 4% of it.
[00:43:45] I've been following interest rates
[00:43:46] and paying attention to interest rates for 40 years now.
[00:43:51] And I mean, for a really, really long time,
[00:43:54] we lived in nothing but a really low
[00:43:56] and higher interest rate economy.
[00:43:58] I mean, it's almost forgetting about that.
[00:44:02] It's only been a couple of years, right?
[00:44:03] It already seems like it's a distant memory.
[00:44:06] It's probably been about four years.
[00:44:08] But we would really low interest rates.
[00:44:10] You had European central banks
[00:44:11] that had negative interest rates.
[00:44:13] You had to basically pay them to hold your money.
[00:44:17] So when I saw something,
[00:44:19] I don't know if it's the Wall Street Journal
[00:44:21] or a grants interest rate observer or something like that,
[00:44:23] he's an expert on interest rates
[00:44:24] and he said interest rates are at 5,000 year lows.
[00:44:29] That resonated with me.
[00:44:32] I'm like, we're going back to the pyramids in Egypt.
[00:44:36] You know what I mean?
[00:44:37] It's like, Tim Common got a 30 year fix in the bank.
[00:44:41] So I was like, this is unbelievable.
[00:44:44] 5,000 years, this guy, this is all he does.
[00:44:46] He's like a subcontent, just studies interest rates.
[00:44:48] That's his thing.
[00:44:49] So I was like, I said to my wife,
[00:44:51] I think it might be time to refinance.
[00:44:53] You know, or pull some money out
[00:44:55] and take out, you know, increase the amount of mortgage,
[00:44:59] pull some money out, which I'm pretty sure
[00:45:00] that I could invest in a higher rate.
[00:45:02] And that's the whole thing about whether you pay a mortgage.
[00:45:04] So if you're going to 2.75 mortgage rate,
[00:45:08] that's your cost of capital.
[00:45:10] You're going to get a tax write off on that, by the way.
[00:45:11] Sure.
[00:45:12] It is interest in the media.
[00:45:13] So it's probably, I don't know,
[00:45:15] let's call it 20% off sale.
[00:45:16] So it's probably like a 2.35
[00:45:19] is your effective interest rate.
[00:45:22] Now at the time, treasury bills were yielding
[00:45:25] like next to nothing.
[00:45:27] Right.
[00:45:27] So it was hard to beat the 2.35 without taking some risk
[00:45:31] by putting it in stock market.
[00:45:33] Right.
[00:45:33] So you could short term interest rates at, you know, 4%,
[00:45:36] they would probably have 4.5 to 10 years,
[00:45:38] somewhere around 4.2.
[00:45:40] So you don't have to do anything.
[00:45:42] You could take that money that you borrowed
[00:45:44] and put it over here in a pretty safe investment
[00:45:47] and have a positive carry.
[00:45:49] You're basically, you're earning more.
[00:45:51] And that's the whole reason when you say
[00:45:52] when you paid mortgage off earlier.
[00:45:54] It's like, could you do better with the money?
[00:45:56] Right, sure.
[00:45:57] If I could have 3% mortgage and I think I can do better
[00:45:59] than 3%, why would I pay my mortgage off sooner?
[00:46:02] Well, yeah, if you can put that money in a bond environment,
[00:46:05] which of course, a lot more stable, didn't yeah.
[00:46:09] It's kind of a no-brainer.
[00:46:11] And just for...
[00:46:11] It depends on the excuse me.
[00:46:13] Just so people will think that bonds are
[00:46:14] all too safe and necessary.
[00:46:16] Depending on the duration of the bond,
[00:46:18] if you have a 30-year bond,
[00:46:20] and as you saw in 20, I think there's 2022,
[00:46:22] interest rates backed up pretty big time.
[00:46:24] So people that are thinking they've done nothing
[00:46:27] but positive returns on the bond market.
[00:46:29] The interest rates have done nothing but drops in 1982.
[00:46:32] That old suddenly for one of the first times,
[00:46:34] early 90s interest rates backed up.
[00:46:36] But we had a pretty severe backup at interest rates in 2022
[00:46:39] and people actually lost money in bond funds.
[00:46:42] So it can happen.
[00:46:43] If you keep a shorter duration, 3.6 months,
[00:46:45] one in two-year treasury bills and notes,
[00:46:49] you're pretty much not going to lose a whole lot of bond.
[00:46:52] You go to a 30-year further out on the curve,
[00:46:54] to 30 years, there's way more risk
[00:46:56] because nobody knows where interest rates are going to be
[00:46:59] in 30 years, little or five years.
[00:47:01] So they've got to be paid for that.
[00:47:03] I need more money.
[00:47:03] I need a higher interest rate for me to take the risk
[00:47:06] of lending you money for 30 years.
[00:47:08] And that's the reason why the further you go out,
[00:47:11] the higher the interest rates.
[00:47:12] Yeah, well, it's a really interesting idea, though,
[00:47:14] of taking equity out, putting it in the market
[00:47:17] in whatever matches your risk tolerance
[00:47:21] and seeing what happens.
[00:47:24] And certainly.
[00:47:25] I hope your viewership is not sound asleep
[00:47:28] with the discussion of interest rates
[00:47:30] and historical interest rates that
[00:47:32] have all the half-year audience with that segment.
[00:47:35] No, I think it's important to talk about
[00:47:37] because we are at a rate where we are today,
[00:47:41] which is still historically pretty low.
[00:47:43] But in relation to 2021, 2021, 2022,
[00:47:47] it seems much higher.
[00:47:48] And you have just a lot of people
[00:47:50] who are sitting on the sidelines.
[00:47:51] And as a result, that's conversations
[00:47:54] that agents have to have is let's talk about
[00:47:57] where rates are, date the rate, marry the home,
[00:48:00] having conversations about that
[00:48:01] and also talking to homeowners who are at 2.75
[00:48:05] and going, I don't really do anything right now
[00:48:07] and having to sort of explain, well, here's what happens
[00:48:12] if rates do go down and all this competition floods
[00:48:14] the market and if you are looking to make a decision
[00:48:17] or make a switch, then there's some consequence
[00:48:19] to that as well.
[00:48:20] So yeah, I think it's important.
[00:48:22] I also wanted to ask you really specifically
[00:48:24] about setting yourself apart from other agents, right?
[00:48:29] From others.
[00:48:29] And I know this is something that we've talked about
[00:48:31] throughout this conversation.
[00:48:33] So it's not something that we haven't touched on.
[00:48:35] But really figuring out, I know you talked about
[00:48:39] sort of what makes you tick.
[00:48:41] What makes you different?
[00:48:42] Can you speak to that a little bit?
[00:48:43] Like figuring out what drives you.
[00:48:45] Tell us what drives you.
[00:48:47] You know, you may have already said this,
[00:48:48] but curious to get your thoughts.
[00:48:50] Let me backtrack one second.
[00:48:51] I'm just curious that there's ever been a study done
[00:48:54] on how many marriages are still together
[00:48:57] because they have a 2.75 mortgage rate.
[00:49:00] Probably more than a few.
[00:49:02] Yeah, they're like, man, I can't stand my spouse
[00:49:04] in any kind of a board to leave.
[00:49:06] I got, I can't, I'm out of here.
[00:49:07] We're gonna have to sell the house
[00:49:08] and I lose this mortgage.
[00:49:10] I'm gonna tough to sell.
[00:49:11] If they had a barrier,
[00:49:12] the water was up to 5.5%,
[00:49:15] somebody's DOA, they're kicking that spouse out.
[00:49:17] But yeah, so I wonder if that,
[00:49:19] I tell people all the time, I'm like, don't move.
[00:49:22] And like, that's not good for your business, is it?
[00:49:23] I said, but it's genuine.
[00:49:26] All right, so what are we talking about?
[00:49:28] Oh, what drives me?
[00:49:30] Well, I didn't know it drove me for the first,
[00:49:35] I gotta say a couple of years.
[00:49:37] And I'm not saying that that's an exercise
[00:49:39] that all agents need to do, who's the figure I will drive.
[00:49:42] And I think, you know, you get to a certain,
[00:49:44] maybe it's just who I am or you get to a certain age,
[00:49:46] you just get a little bit more contemplative
[00:49:48] and you're thinking about things maybe more
[00:49:50] instead of just kicking out with your life.
[00:49:52] But I needed that.
[00:49:54] For me, to be motivated, I needed to figure out
[00:49:59] what it is that I wanted.
[00:50:01] Like, I know the first career of Wall Street,
[00:50:04] it was all about making money.
[00:50:05] I was 22 years old.
[00:50:06] I came right out of school and wasn't the smartest kid
[00:50:09] in my class and then have the best grades.
[00:50:11] But I was very financially motivated from a young age.
[00:50:14] And not financially motivated to be rich
[00:50:16] so I could drive a Lamborghini.
[00:50:18] It was really just like, it was the game of it.
[00:50:22] Like, just to accumulate money, no barriers.
[00:50:26] Then as I started realizing, I was like,
[00:50:28] I just want to make money so that I don't,
[00:50:31] I have freedom.
[00:50:32] It was about freedom.
[00:50:34] Having the ability to not panic if I lost my job
[00:50:37] or have the freedom to maybe at some point not work to 70.
[00:50:42] So that was, you know, that kind of
[00:50:43] what drove me in that first career,
[00:50:45] it was financially motivated.
[00:50:47] That's why I was confused with this one
[00:50:48] because the teaching thing would have been easy.
[00:50:50] I know what drove me on that was to make kids love history
[00:50:53] or make them think school wasn't suck
[00:50:56] and be one of those teachers that could be special.
[00:51:00] Real estate had no idea.
[00:51:02] I was basically, you know,
[00:51:05] what they say, fake it to you and make it.
[00:51:07] I didn't know what I was doing there.
[00:51:10] I didn't know why I was doing it.
[00:51:11] I just needed something to keep me busy, have purpose.
[00:51:16] So I was searching after a year or two
[00:51:17] to just try to figure out,
[00:51:19] was I knew it was important for me to figure out
[00:51:22] what drives me because if I don't,
[00:51:24] I don't know how long I stick at this
[00:51:26] because I need that as a motivator.
[00:51:29] And it finally occurred to me
[00:51:32] what really drove me was providing value.
[00:51:38] I don't know if it's just I'm a cheap S.O.B. by nature.
[00:51:41] Maybe that's what it is.
[00:51:43] But I just feel like, I'm like, what are these people were?
[00:51:46] What would ever somebody says,
[00:51:47] this is what it costs them?
[00:51:48] Like that seems like a lot of money.
[00:51:50] Like how long does that take
[00:51:51] until you actually do the job and you're like,
[00:51:54] oh, this is a nightmare.
[00:51:56] So I was like, I'm sure, I'm sure that everybody says,
[00:52:00] like, oh, real estate agents make way too much.
[00:52:03] So it was almost like a mission for me to prove that,
[00:52:07] first of all, I tell them, listen,
[00:52:09] the listing is, you know, whatever the percentage is,
[00:52:11] I don't get to keep all of it.
[00:52:12] I said, I got a company that's got to get paid.
[00:52:14] And I said, you know, then I have to pay taxes on.
[00:52:16] I have no healthcare, I'm an independent contractor.
[00:52:18] So I don't want you to think I'm getting, you know,
[00:52:20] I'm buying a yacht next week on the back of this commission.
[00:52:22] So part of it was, I didn't want,
[00:52:25] I wanted them to feel like that was providing value.
[00:52:28] So I was like, how do I do that?
[00:52:30] And you can't predict it all the time
[00:52:32] how you're going to provide value.
[00:52:33] Sometimes it's going to be in negotiations
[00:52:36] with a potential buyer or running
[00:52:39] up multiple law for situation.
[00:52:40] So it's going to provide value that way.
[00:52:42] But I provided value in ways that I never,
[00:52:45] never knew that was going to even happen.
[00:52:47] I had one house that I was sold at the back in 2018 or 19.
[00:52:51] And it was about a $2.5 million house.
[00:52:54] And it was a summertime and around this part of New Jersey,
[00:52:57] a lot of people go down to shore.
[00:52:59] I don't have a shore house.
[00:53:00] And I was probably the only schmuck in August
[00:53:03] that was sweating and walking around
[00:53:04] in streets of Madison, New Jersey with no summer house
[00:53:07] and no good vacation spot to go to.
[00:53:11] So the seller texted me, I think, from the beach
[00:53:15] and says, listen, we've got the giant trees
[00:53:18] that are on the edge of our property.
[00:53:20] I mean, like 75, 80 feet high oak trees that are gigantic
[00:53:25] and they're dead.
[00:53:26] And I think it's on the town's property.
[00:53:28] It's the town had a section of land
[00:53:30] that was right next to the house.
[00:53:31] I said, let me call somebody from the town.
[00:53:34] And I meet the guy over there and he goes,
[00:53:35] ah, this is on the homeowner's property.
[00:53:38] So I call a tree surgeon, tree guy to come in.
[00:53:41] I said, hey, Chris, how much does this got a cost?
[00:53:43] Because these are big trees.
[00:53:44] And he goes, they are dead and they can fall on the car
[00:53:46] or kill somebody.
[00:53:47] They really do need to come out.
[00:53:48] I said, how much is it?
[00:53:49] He goes, like, seven grand.
[00:53:50] It's a lot of money, big trees.
[00:53:53] So I said to the seller, hey, listen,
[00:53:55] do you guys have a survey of your property?
[00:53:57] The house is only like 10, actually six years old.
[00:54:00] Yeah, we have a survey of them last.
[00:54:01] So if you go into the house,
[00:54:02] tells you what the survey is.
[00:54:04] I take a tape measure and I walk off on a tape measure
[00:54:07] from the side edge of the house to the property one.
[00:54:11] And I realized that the trees are like six or seven feet
[00:54:14] on the town's property.
[00:54:16] So I screenshot it, sent it to her.
[00:54:20] She said, he emails it to the town.
[00:54:22] The town said, no problem.
[00:54:23] I'll take it down.
[00:54:23] So it's a same as the former grand.
[00:54:25] And then I also fought their taxes for them,
[00:54:27] which they, I think she called the Spelker Rubas.
[00:54:30] They don't allow you to do it anymore.
[00:54:31] I called them up and I said, listen,
[00:54:33] this house is listed now below the assessed value.
[00:54:36] And the assessed value is 90% of what you think it will sell for.
[00:54:40] And they were like, all right, we'll kick the taxes down.
[00:54:41] So I think it was 8,000 bucks.
[00:54:43] So they didn't get the full benefit of the tax reduction.
[00:54:46] Whoever bought it, it was going to be a more attractive property
[00:54:49] because the taxes were 8,000 dollars less.
[00:54:51] So, hey, that's one thing.
[00:54:52] What a quick story.
[00:54:54] There was a lot of times at home inspections.
[00:54:57] The, they do a home inspection.
[00:54:58] Sometimes some home inspectors feel like they got to justify
[00:55:02] their expense.
[00:55:04] Yeah.
[00:55:04] I farm as many as as is wrong as possible.
[00:55:06] So it's almost like you're a defensive attorney.
[00:55:09] With the other side says, you know, this is what's wrong
[00:55:11] with the house.
[00:55:12] And then you have to go out and get your expert witnesses
[00:55:15] that come back and say, you know, you're guys fully, you know,
[00:55:17] like, so this was a condo and there was a fireplace.
[00:55:20] $10,000.
[00:55:21] They put a camera to fireplace.
[00:55:23] The guy says, yeah, it's about $10,000 worth of repairs.
[00:55:26] I'm like, that's a lot.
[00:55:28] So I bring an archimney guy and he's renowned in our area
[00:55:33] for being honest and good.
[00:55:35] And he goes, yeah, there's some problems with this chimney.
[00:55:37] I said, all right, well, lay it on me.
[00:55:39] What's it going to cost?
[00:55:39] He said, it's been about $1,200.
[00:55:41] I said, put it in writing immediately got it in writing,
[00:55:45] sent it over to the other agent.
[00:55:47] She recognized who was given this estimate,
[00:55:49] realized that he's very professional, very good.
[00:55:51] She immediately told her buyer, we gave a credit
[00:55:54] of $1,200.
[00:55:55] Now, if I don't get involved in that,
[00:55:58] and just let the attorneys deal with it,
[00:56:00] maybe the seller just goes, oh, I guess my chimney's best
[00:56:02] though, let's give him 10 grand off the price.
[00:56:04] I think what the attorney says, listen,
[00:56:06] we'll split the difference.
[00:56:08] And that would have been floodgrain,
[00:56:10] instead of $1,200.
[00:56:11] So again, that drives me, is defined a way I never can tell.
[00:56:17] I don't know if somebody's got trees, dead trees on property
[00:56:19] that's on the property line, or somebody's got a chimney
[00:56:22] that they're going to get ripped off on.
[00:56:23] I never know what's going to happen in the deal
[00:56:26] that I'm going to be able to provide value,
[00:56:28] but I'm almost looking for it.
[00:56:29] And if I can have somebody come out of the other end,
[00:56:32] I love to try to be able to pay for my own commission.
[00:56:35] And I point that out to him,
[00:56:37] I'm like, listen, the commission was 12 grand.
[00:56:38] I saved you 9,000 bucks.
[00:56:40] Can we agree that I only cost you three,
[00:56:42] and I was a good deal?
[00:56:43] And they laugh because most people just don't think like I do,
[00:56:47] but who just trying to always provide value today?
[00:56:51] I love that.
[00:56:52] Well, Scott Spellker was our guest today,
[00:56:54] and for anyone listening who has clients, agents,
[00:56:57] and other parts of the country who have clients
[00:56:59] that move into New Jersey, reach out to Scott.
[00:57:02] He may or may not be able to help them
[00:57:04] based on where they're moving to,
[00:57:05] but you certainly would love to touch base
[00:57:07] with you, make that connection.

My conversation with Scott Spellker. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Best advice you have received in real estate. That's the best advice I've been receiving in the state. And I guess we're going to go with their worst advice, too. You know, I'd say the best advice I probably got. Was that you really had to kind of brand yourself in some way. Kind of figure out, it takes a little time. Figure out who you're going to be. And I talked to different real estate agents and try to get a feel for, what was the thing that was going to kind of really resonate with me? And I guess the word was trust. It just kept coming back to that word of trust. And how important it is to have somebody you're working with that you trust. But along with that advice, they said, you know, in addition to branding and you want to really, for lack of a better word, put yourself out there. So sometimes it's a little bit hard because it doesn't feel genuine when you're joining clubs, you know, basically to meet people and to kind of meet new people to be able to sell real estate. But I didn't really do that as much. But the point is the same. You've got to be out there. You can't be holed up in your house, in your basement, meeting nobody. As I told my wife, when I go golfing several times a week in the nice weather that I'm working on client relations, and she's like, you're going golfing. And I was like, well, how do you know that you can call it that? But I have to tell you, there's a lot of people that you play with over time. And you just got to build a rapport. For me, it's golf. You build a rapport that I have no doubt that the time comes to sell their house. I'm going to be probably the first game in the list because there's just a relationship that's built up through something that I just enjoy doing. That's playing golf. So that's part of it. Part of it is, you know, if you're active, maybe, you know, you're, I don't know, a girl scout mom or maybe you're a baseball coach or you're a cheerleader coach or a dance instructor or your talent council, whatever it is, people just need to see you out there. And I don't go up to them and basically, so they run the other way when they see me and want to talk to them about real estate all the time. You don't want to be that person. But they'll know who you are. They'll know that you do real estate. And I think it's important to advertise, especially in the beginning. You want to advertise, get your name out there. I mean, I used to do open houses and I branded my open house signs. I caught a lot of flack with some of the other agents. They didn't think, you know, you can't do that. Managers like, yeah, not only can you do it, I've encouraged you all to do it. And he's the only one that bought his own signs. So brand your signs. And then what I would do is I would have an open house on, you know, some street. And most people put out like, you know, a sign in the corner or maybe one down the next corner. I would put a dozen signs out. Sometimes stretching from main street in my town to the next town. It was along the same road, but I would have friends at the time were like, hey, I want to come by, visit you at your open house. Where is this thing? I've been driving for three miles. I wanted people like anywhere they drove to see my real estate sign because I was trying to project like I was doing way more business maybe than I was when I first joined. So buy a lot of signs and you do open houses and put them everywhere. Technically, you have to take them down by a certain time, but sometimes I would forget. And it would be there for the morning rush hour for people to see as well. But yeah, so I guess there's a long way of saying, you know, get yourself out, put yourself out there. Interact. Don't be a secret agent. Yeah, don't be a secret agent. Interact with other people. And preferably in things that you enjoy. And more often than not, you're going to see that people are going to bring up real estate to you. I'm never the one that brings it up. I never bring it up on the gockboards. I don't bring it up at parties, social situations. I don't not talk about it. You know, there's a house, the market, that's the market. So yeah, you know, I'll have a conversation with them about it, but I just don't want to be that guy that you're going away from because all he wants to do is ask if you want to sell your house. But so that would be the best advice I got, I suppose. The worst advice, and it's not that bad. But you know, as somebody that, you know, I had, was really trying to get going quickly. I'm not a patient person. I worked on Wall Street for 25 years as a trader. Everything was very quickly. And you know, everything happened on a warp speed. So the advice was listen, just be patient. It's going to take five to six years before you really start getting any traction in this business. And I think if I took that advice, I probably would have just kind of sat back and maybe taken the small amount of money that the company, and the office gives you for marketing. A lot of people didn't even use the market. They gave us like $200 a month for, that you could use for a mailers and stuff. And I was amazed at how many people did not even use the free money to send out mailers. So I decided, listen, five or six years are not going to do it for me. But the other was the advice. Five or six years and, you know, learn from the ropes and maybe you should join a team first and learn this business that way. And I think for some people maybe, if you're not a self-starter, it's not a bad way to go. But I was like, yeah, no. The first year, I made $50,000. And I spent $45,000. I would say probably 10 of it was, you know, videos and photography and expenses and stuff. But the other 35,000 was on marketing. And then the next year, just for round numbers, we'll say, you did $100,000 and I spent $50,000. Well, my wife says, you're gonna work, you're gonna work over two years, you make $55,000. She says like $27,500 a year. You can make a lot of work for not a lot of money. I said, I'm like Amazon, I'm building a base here. It's all revenue right now, no profits. Yeah. But I threw a lot of money into the business, whether it's the brochure at our church in town when people were recognizing this time, 50 years. But the diner, you go from church to take the kids to the diner and there I am in a place. Then you go to hit golf balls at the driving range or play miniatures, golf, I have to do it on there again. I mean, just all over the place. And you go to the recreation field for your kids football, soccer, lacrosse game, whatever. There I am again. So it was just, you know, people say, is it worth the money to advertise? Can you do a course benefit ratio? And I'm like, I have no idea. I mean, for the longest time I thought the church full of him was probably kind of a complete waste of time. I advertised here because them and my mother would say to me, did you go to church this weekend? I would say, yeah, I go to church every weekend. And she goes, no, you don't. I didn't see you in churches. We've been, I said, look, I go to every single mess. And she says, oh, you're lying now. And I said, I'm in the bulletin. And that's technically I'm in church. So I was going to stop advertising after a couple of years in the church bulletin. And at one time I got a phone call from a guy like on a Monday afternoon, I'm driving to town and I'm thinking, as real estate agents, anybody listening to us will know that we get calls. We have to answer our phone because you never know. It could be, you know, somebody wants to sell a house, a buy a house. So more often than not, it's some nonsense call. And you're just like, for a while there, they were selling it. Was it car warranties or something? They would get me like three times a day with them. So anyway, I pick up the phone on a Monday afternoon and it turns out this guy and he says, listen, I'm thinking about selling my house. I was like, well, you know, when you would like to get together because what are you doing right now? And I was like, I'll be there in five minutes. Put his house on the market four days later. And I said, you know, why did you, you give me a call? Why did you pick us? He said, you know, I heard a lot of good things about you from my kids school, you know, some of the parents. And then I was in church and I've kind of bored at the end and I'm flipping through the bullets in. The church bulletin, I see your face there and it says something like 50 year parishioner or something, he goes, this is my guy. So the church bulletin actually got me that listing and then he referred me to somebody else. Between the two of them is about a $4 million worth of real estate, which is, you know, whatever, call it two and a half percent, $100,000 before my split. But a pretty serious amount of money. So the next year when the salesperson called me where they wanted to stay with the church bulletin and pay them whatever, $1,400, I'm like, there's no way I can cancel this. Not because I think I'm gonna get additional business, but I was so blessed to get any sort of return on that after five years and putting out $7,000 I'm thinking that was a complete waste of money. So the point is advertise, invest in yourself, get your name out there as much as you can. You're never gonna know exactly which is the one is the reason you got the listing, but at the end of the day, you've got to put that money back in and I looked it at this way, look, if I put $20,000, which is a ton of money compared to what most agents were spent. Around here, that's the equivalent of, you know, if you get a listing that's ish, I don't know, a million dollars, okay, it's not quite, but maybe it's two listings of $700,000. So it's a little bit of work. I mean, that work that you do in those two listings and you're throwing it right back into the business, but I mean, you just have to do it. If you wanna have kind of a decent amount of business coming in, and the more business you have coming in makes you, how do I describe this? All right, you know when you go to a bar, we're gonna go off the rails here. So I gotta go back, I'm 62, I gotta spend a while, of course, it's been many, many years since I've been at a bar, but you're gonna go to a bar and you're a single guy and we all know that we've all been there. And it applies to women of church, you know, but you go to a bar and you're hoping to meet somebody, right? Hope it to meet somebody and they can smell the desperation. So nothing's happened, right? Meanwhile, if you had just started dating somebody, maybe a couple of weeks before, you're kind of seeing each other, then when you go to the bar, all of a sudden, it's like you can't miss. All these girls won't hold anything in, like what's the difference? It's the same with real estate in this sense that when you have quite a bit of business going on, you don't reap of desperation, you're a little bit more relaxed, a little bit more calm, a little bit more self-assured, not desperate that you're gonna make a mistaken and worrying so much about what comes out of your mouth with the listing presentation on my God, and should I say, you know, this word or should I say that word? And then you're just uptight. So it's, you know, maybe it's not a great analogy, but I think you understand where I'm coming from. It's if you have some business going on, it's gonna allow you to be a little bit more flexible and a little bit more at ease, and that is actually gonna lead to more business because nobody wants to be sold anything. You know, when you go to a department store, you go into this store and you see the person coming over and you're worse. It's the worst, right? All they're gonna do is say, you know, can I help you with anything? It's harmless. They're not really, they're not all over you. Just them coming over, I'm like, oh God, can I hide behind the sweater section? Because I don't wanna talk to anybody. That's the same thing I think you get a lot of times your real estate with, like, you know, even if I'm in an open house, you know, you gotta give them some space. Sometimes they, they're more likely to come up to you if you say, hey, listen, you have any questions with the house, the paperwork's over there. Happy to give you the help you, blah, blah, blah, let them see the house. You know, won't be, you know, change where you guys from. You guys have an agent, you know, nobody wants to be sold anything. Let them feel like, it'd be a privilege, like you're good enough that you don't need to do that. So, you know, that's a long way of saying us some of the advice I got. You can cut that piece up as many of which ways to say it. Oh, we will not cut a moment. We will not be cutting a moment of that because everything you said was amazing. It's really exactly the advice that lots of other people that have come on our show have given in bits and pieces. You gave a lot of it right up front. This is the very first few minutes of the show and I cannot thank you enough because you were very thoughtful and intentional in your answers and our audience was taking notes. They're listening, they're going to go back and re-listen because there's so much given there and we could really stop the interview right now and just call it a day and that would make me very happy with the content but we're going to do more of course. But let's, in fact, I want to say before we introduce Scott which we haven't even done yet, I want to say this is the reason why I do this show and I am, I've been doing this for seven years and this is not new for me and people say, boy, it must be a grind and yeah, I guess to some degree, everything that's worthwhile is a grind. But I get to meet people like Scott and this is really exciting for me because I really like Scott and we just met minutes before, but I really like him and I'm really so blessed, you talked about being blessed, you talked about playing golf and you're right, you're spending four hours with somebody playing 18 holes or whatever you're playing and you're developing a relationship with them and especially if you go to a golf course by yourself, they're going to pair you with somebody so you're definitely going to meet somebody new. But I get to do that on this show and I'm so grateful for it because I get to meet cool people like Scott who have been in this business a long time, Scott comes from a Wall Street previously and his career will talk about that in a moment but I get to meet people like Scott which is so fortunate for me because even though I'm not out there practicing as an agent which would make more sense for me doing the show if I was but our audience gets to benefit from that but I also get to meet people like this who are inspiring to me. So let's bring them on. So Scott's already here of course, Scott Spellker is who we're chatting with, he's from the Spellker team with Coldwell Banker in Madison, New Jersey, which is about 30 minutes or so west of Manhattan and in a really fun part of New Jersey I have spent some time around that area back when I used to work for Anaheiser Bush and we were touring around. But let's talk more about Scott. Scott is married to his life and business partner Amy Spellker for 37 years met at Dickinson College. They, he majored in economics went directly to Wall Street where he became a foreign exchange trader, Forex which is what you hear a lot about these days of course but certainly not an easy thing to do. After 25 year career, Scott went into real estate and has been doing that for the last 11 years. He's active in his community. He's served on several boards, boards, boards of directors. He is, he volunteers, he gives back. He's coached youth league baseball and football for a combined 35 years and has also coached the Madison High School of RC tennis team. I am a tennis player as well. I appreciate that for three years. Scott and Amy have three sons and a granddaughter. They both love to travel domestically internationally. Scott's other hobbies include playing golf as he mentioned and reading. And what everybody to follow Scott and his team at Spellker, NJ Homes, he is in New Jersey. So Spellker, NJ Homes on Instagram and you can find him. He's easy to find. You go to his church, he's in the Bolton. So easy to find. Scott, welcome, welcome to the show. We were so grateful to have you. Thanks for having me. Yeah, let's talk about, so I'm curious about the move from Wall Street to real estate. Very different, obviously different, well, maybe not a different skill set. I'm not sure. We have the board of exchange here in the mercantile exchange here and the options exchange here in Chicago. So I know a little bit of that world. I've never quite understood trading interest rates and things like that, which are always confusing to me. When I ask traders, do you want things to go up or down? They're like, we just want movement. We don't really care where it comes. We're just like, okay, that's hard for me to wrap my mind around. But anyway, you did this for a long time in New York and a very fast-paced environment. You saw a lot of change in the technology at Wall Street, of course, over that time. But curious, what prompted the change from Wall Street to real estate? Well, there's a, we got to throw it a little bit of failure in there first. Because it's, would you listen and somebody talk about yourself or whatever, you know, what your background is? You're kind of like, oh, enough already about this guy. And meanwhile, that guy is me. There's a lot of bloodsooting tears and a lot of failure that we need to point out here. So I did go right to Wall Street and everybody came before me. I was working for a commercial bank and usually within six months, you got a chance to start trading. It took me two years. I was getting breakfast for everybody, lunch, coffee. It was like pledging a fraternity for the first two years. And eventually, I got my shot and I had a fairly successful career. It was absolute mayhem in the 80s and 90s. And you're sitting in a trading room of either a bank or investment bank and essentially everybody had their own currency. That was based on how good you were. And the bank is letting you make bets with their money to make more money. So if I thought the euro was gonna go higher, I'd buy five million euros, 10 million euros, 50 million euros, and sometimes it would only go up a little bit and you'd make 10 grand, 20 grand, but it went up a lot of it. You might make 500 grand. So the more money you made for them, the more money you got paid at the end of the year, it's not that they paid you. It wasn't commissioned either. It wasn't sales. It was trading. It was basically making bets. And if you were good at it, you got paid well and if you didn't, you got fired. And the reason I left after 25 years was kind of what you alluded to before. There wasn't as much action. The grant, and 25 years later I was 47, 48. You think you'd be a little bit burned out by then, but when there was a lot of movement, a lot of action to date just flew. But what happened is once the euro came around, it used to be many more currencies than the euro came around in 1999. But the volatility kind of went out of it after, I mean, there was a little bit of volatility in a way during the financial crisis, but it was like watching paint dry. You traded a little bit to 11 o'clock in the morning when London went home and then you basically sat around until five or six o'clock at night. And I got bored. I just really got bored. I just didn't want to do it anymore. So this is where the failure comes in. I went back to school at night to the College of St. Elizabeth, close by to where I live in Madison and they had an alternate root teaching program. My brother had done it years before when he was 32 or something and I'm doing this at 48 at the time. And so I went back to school to become a teacher. I wanted to teach US history, world history, economics, and sort of thing. I figured I could coach as well. And I went through the program and student taught at a local high school by all accounts I wasn't terrible. Kind of more scary going up against, up against, but in front of, second semester seniors that have already mailed it in. And I've got to talk to them about sociology and world history without boring them to tears. More frightening, I would say, then when I played quarterback in college and getting hit by an outside linebacker and more frightening than trading on Wall Street. It was wrong, I guess these kids. At the time though, when I graduated, there were probably, you know, I don't know, maybe 50 people in our class and like only four of them were able to get full-time jobs. So every time we applied for positions, there were like 300 applications. So I wasn't able to get hired. I did some long-term service, but after three years, I couldn't land a teaching job. So I left the previous career, go to become a teacher, I failed miserably at securing a job. Pretty low point in my life, to be honest with you. Nothing ever came easy to me. I mean, everything I did, I had to work pretty hard for it. And this I didn't work hard for, but nobody would give me a chance. So that was a bit disappointing. And it was a little bit, you know, I was definitely down for a while, not just financially, but I was also like really bummed out. I had no purpose. And it was too young to be, 48, 49 years was a big retired. So everybody said, I'll be sure you go into real estate. And I struggled with that because, I don't know, I just felt like it wasn't for me. But I ended up taking the test, passed it. And I said, you know, if I don't like it, I'll just quit. I'm not walking away from a Wall Street career, I can walk away from real estate. And the first, I really didn't want anything to be that competitive. You know, my previous career on Wall Street was so competitive. And that's why the thought of teaching appealed to me, you know, to coach people in education, making excited about learning, about history even. And that really appealed to me. And there's no competition. I go to my competition with the social studies teacher across the whole. I mean, I'm just, I can do my own thing and not have to compete. I don't want to compete anymore. So I ended up going into real estate and thinking, this is not a competitive, it's not competitive, it's just your own thing. And it's just going to be like being a teacher. Within, I'd say six months, I came home one day and my wife said, something different about you. And I said, I'm back. Excuse me, what did we need to back? That's it, I'm back. And she just looked in my eyes. She knew exactly what I meant. Back to being that kind of very, very competitive Wall Street person, not the person that's been offered the last two or three years, kind of in, you know, professorial mode, going to be a teacher. And so I became very competitive about it and went all in. I don't do anything kind of part way. Is I'm either all in or I'm not? So, yeah, you know, on the road to, I mean, I guess I'm a fairly successful real estate person. If I was 40, I'd probably have a team of 20 people, but at 62, that doesn't appeal to me. So, yeah, I mean, I guess that a lot of bench blocks were pretty successful. I'm not all that, believe me, I'm not all that. But it's just important, I think, that people realize that, yes, you can have a second career, but my second career actually came after the one I failed at, you know, become trying to become a teacher, which really was what I wanted to do with that next stage of my life and it just didn't work out for me. But real estate has, in some respects, saved my life because, you know, I don't know how well I would have done mentally and emotionally, if I continued to have zero purpose in my life, I'm nothing to do. So, I'm grateful. I want to ask about your brand because we talked about branding, and I know trust is a big one for you. We were speaking about that before we started, and trust is the great one. I think if that's anybody's brand, I think that's a pretty good choice for a brand, not that it has to be just one thing. But can you talk about what trust means to you and how you go about thinking about how to demonstrate that, right? Because, of course, everybody wants to be trusted, but there's steps to take, and there's ways to do it, and there's ways to, of course, a road trust or remove it entirely. But how do you think about trust, and how do you really establish that with your clients? That's a great question. Because, yeah, I mean, you can pay lip service to it, and you can put that on your marketing or your listing presentation. But if you don't really explain why it's important to you, it probably isn't going to mean much to the person you're talking to. So trust to me, I think, has a couple different things that I'm not going to beat into death, but part of it is you're going to trust that the people you're working with are experts in this field, beating us, and that we're competent, that we get it. You know when you come across somebody where you're interfacing with them, it could be through work or you're a sales thing, or you're trying to buy something online, or on a phone, wherever, and you're talking to the other person, and they just get it. It's quick, it's seamless. So I think that's important. You can trust that you have people that you're dealing with that just get it. You know, they get the fact that when you shoot them a text, they want to hear back, like now. They don't want to hear back at four hours. You can call me at 10 o'clock at night. If I'm awake, I'm going to answer that phone. And you can trust that I'm going to go that extra mile, whether that means you're calling me from four, and there's whether we just have recently even, but and you say, listen, could you check on our house tomorrow to make sure there's no water in the basement or out of town? I'm like, no, I'm not checking out at tomorrow. I'm checking out right now. And they're like, no, no, no, it's 10 o'clock at night. I'm like, listen, I still am closed. I'm going to your house right now, take a video and send it to you. So you can trust us to go there, sure, while you can trust us to be competent. But the other thing about the trust, and I do point this out, I usually put up a slide in our listening presentation, and I must have seen this something like on social media, it's like the least trusted professions in the United States. I was like, here we go. I wasn't looking towards the top when I was looking for the real estate agent. I went down towards the bottom and I worked my way up from the bottom to get that's where it's going to be. And I drove with people sometimes like, you know, I thought we would be neck and neck with the used cars, hell, skin, but the things out were a little bit higher. And listen, there's lawyers which are, you know, very highly educated people that are actually, I think, lower than real estate agents. So to me, that trust aspect, and we make a little bit of joke out of it, joke out of it. And I will say that the people that I work with, generally, not just in this office, but in this area are very professional. They really are. But that, you know, the reputation still stands. And you ask a lot of people what they think are real estate agents. They think they don't do anything for the money and the reputation, the some reputation of us. And that was one of the things that kept me from maybe going into this field because I didn't, I didn't like that aspect. And then once I did go in, I said, let me at least try to have people come out of the other side of transactions saying this guy was very professional. This is not what I expected from a real estate agent. That's nothing. So as far as the trust aspects, I will point out to some of the sellers from the listing presentation and say, look, you know, we talk about trust. There's a lot of games that a real estate agent can play that you would never know. I mean, it's all a different things, you know, and I feel an example out where, you know, okay, I have a listing for our house. We're going to keep the numbers around here. So a million dollars. And most of these people have gone on zelo at some point. I say, you know, my zest of it is, you know, $9.89. So an agent can say, well, listen, even though I think that house is, you know, maybe $11, but yeah, that zest of it looks good. Let's listed it, you know, $9.89. And by the way, I've got a buyer for your home. I'm working with several buyers. And I bring that buyer in to see your house. And I tell the buyer, I say, listen, you know, it's not even going to hit the market, but you really should ask, you should offer over asking. So instead of $9.89, come in at a million 30. And I say to this seller, listen, my buyer really loves this house. And they're going to come in at a million 30. And I'm going to cut the commission by one percentage point. So you're going to benefit by that. And if it's one point on a million 30, it's basically, what is that? 10,000, that's 1,000. No, it's 1,300. The 13,000. It's like 1,300 blocks, yeah. That's why I'm not on Wall Street or what I can. So it's saving them 1,300 bucks. And they're getting like, you know, 30, 50, 50 grand over asking. Yeah. And they'll be telling people a cocktail party, and say, oh, this agent was so good, they got me, you know, 50 grand over asking, they got me saving the commission unbelievable. And I'm like, that's like the worst thing you can do. The biggest thing is to try to get the biggest amount of exposure for your house. So maybe I did bring a bring a buyer, but I'm exposing this house to everybody. And let's say there's four offers and it goes highest invest. And it comes in at the top offer, comes in at 1.2. So you would have left like $170,000 on the table. And that's the thing. So there's so many different examples that I can give people, usually give one or two. And they're like, I never thought about that. I said, yeah, I mean, there's different things that agents can do that there's nothing illegal about. They're not bringing you a buyer for your home. They're bringing you a number that's more than you thought you're going to get based on whatever the Zilla estimate was. They cut the commission. There's nothing illegal about it, but I just feel like you're better off putting it on the market, trying it as many people to bid on it and get you the biggest number. So that's kind of another way that trust comes in. It's not just competence. It's not just the fact that you know these people are going to be a community to go the extra distance. You can trust that we'll do that, but you also can trust that we're not going to play games. We're going to try to get to the most money for your house. Period end of story. If there's a reason why I think you shouldn't take an offer that's maybe higher than another one, I'm going to be really clear about it. But ultimately, it's not for me to make that decision. It's for me to put everything out there of some different variables in the sales. And this could happen or that could happen. You've got to live with your decision. What would I do? This is what I would do, but that doesn't mean it's right for you. So again, you're trusting that somebody is sharp. They have judgment, street smarts, that they have your back. And that's what we try to get across. And we do. I mean, you can't do it in a mailer. But what you can do is when you meet with a listing presentation and you spend a good bit of time on that. And the message comes across that you're very, you're upfront. You're honest about what you believe in. And if it's not a good fit, don't use me. I know you have a very specific opinion about mailer's, who we're talking about about this and trust, I think, is factors into this question as well. Or this topic, which is mailers that homeowners get, let's say I have a buyer ready for you. Tell us what your sort of thoughts about that. Yeah, well, I mean, I think when I first started seeing that, somebody must have come up and one of these workshops and the 1000 agents go to and they send out the have a buyer for their home. And I think probably initially it was a bunch of garbage. But as time goes on, sometimes you'll see it's very specific. They'll say, you know, Marion Joe looking for, Senator Hall Colonial, this is their price point. Totally legit. I mean, it could be absolutely legit that they have buyers in that price point. But my point is like, well, great, when you put my house on the market, assuming I choose to use you as my listing agent, and you're, it's also a way to get your foot in the door. If you say I had a buyer for your home and they contact you, do you really have a buyer for my own? Yes, maybe we should take a look at your home and we can give you an idea about your house's worth. It's basically a way to get your foot in the door. Sure. But the, again, it goes back to the other story, it's like I have a buyer for your home. And what you should be saying is I have a buyer for your home, but you shouldn't take their offer until you put it on the market and let everybody else, that's what you should say. You know what you're right? It should say that, you're right. And that should be the pitch, yeah. Yeah, so, you know, I try to get that message out to people. You know, it is effective. The, I lost out on a listing to somebody and I asked them, I said, why did you, why didn't you give us a call? And they said, well, they called me up on the phone and they said they had a buyer for our house. I was like, oh my God. Do I need to go down into the lower, lower, echelons here and start calling people and telling them a buyer, I won't do it. I mean, if I was 40, maybe I would, but I just, I don't know, it just doesn't appeal to me. It doesn't seem, it's not, it's not that sell as best interest. It doesn't feel to me genuine. It feels to me like it's a bait and switch. Yeah. I was telling you, I just, I just had a, I would say a more comfortable version of that strategy, which I think would sort of fit in an authentic way from a very, very successful agent out in Beverly Hills. And I was asking him how he got clients and he initially had started as a production assistant in the entertainment industry. And I assumed he was going to say, oh, well, you know, I built all these contacts and then I then would have been a real estate when I realized I wasn't going to get my shot to be a director. And I just kind of, you know, I had all these wealthy people that were in that business and they start working with me. He goes, no, because I didn't have that network because I was really trying to be in that industry and I wasn't there to make contacts for real estate. And then eventually I said, I gotta get a real estate. And he said, so what I did, and he did this and I thought this was really smart. And I'm curious to get your thoughts because I think it ties into what you're saying, but I think in a way that does work, which is he said, it goes, I love homes so much that I would walk around to these luxury homes that I could see pictures of them. I knew what they looked like on the inside. I fell in love with these homes. These are not homes that are on the market. These are just homes that he learned about. And he would knock on these people's doors and he would say, I am so sorry to bother you. I'm not here to sell you anything. He said, I love this house and I'm a real estate agent. And if you don't, if you could just show me a little bit of the inside, like I just want to confirm that what I think is in there is in there. And I'm not here to try to get you to list with me. You're probably not going to move anyway, but I just want to see if it matches what I think it is. And so he'd do that. He was very, very authentically doing this. And he said, everyone's flattered. When you do that, so they'd show them around and he'd go, oh my God, this is amazing. He goes, look, whenever you are thinking about selling, I don't care when it is. He goes, I want to get a crack at bringing you a buyer. You don't have to list with me, I don't care. But he goes like, I will find you a buyer for this place. And he's like, I just want an opportunity because I love this house. And he did it very authentically. And that's how he got busy. He knocked on doors and he did it that way. I never heard of anyone doing quite like that. And he's a nice guy. And he's a genuine guy. And he's an honest guy. And I thought, boy, that's a great strategy. That works. And he said, I just give him my card. And maybe two, three years later, maybe they call me, maybe they don't. He goes, but he goes, I would go to them and say, you got it, I got to see this house. This is amazing. And I thought, that's a really cool way to get in someone's favor and also possibly get a listing down the road. And he did, he would get listings that way. But he would say, my clients want places like this. I don't necessarily have one right this second, but you're not selling so it doesn't matter. But I will find you somebody. I thought that was a really cool idea. I just thought I'd bring that up. Because you, it's fun to trust. I don't have an issue with that. Listen, everybody has their way of doing this. Doesn't mean I'm right. Somebody else is wrong. I actually had zero problem with that. If it's genuine, you can't do that. And then thank you, it'll go right to the next door and knock on their door too. Right. Oh, no, no, yeah. It has to be very, right? And I think you can go to the door. Yeah, I think I can do it. Even in town of Madison, there's probably, I don't know, 10 or 20 houses that I've always thought were really beautiful houses. And some of my never been inside. So I could genuinely go up and knock on somebody's door and say, listen, I've always loved this house. I've lived here for 50 years. It was always, you know, I always figured if I hit it big on Wall Street, this would be the house I'd look to own. I could absolutely have that conversation with the seller because I truly believe it. And I was, it was only going to be a certain number of homes. Yeah, and that was just exact same philosophy too, is he works in the ultra high luxury sort of space where there aren't a ton of these homes, but, you know, he would just, just make a connection and he would stay in touch. And anyway, I want to chat because you have this really impressive finance background. And I want to talk about the Fed, because I know as REALTORS, you know, we look to the Fed oftentimes, we look at where, where what the Fed's doing with interest rates. And then we assume that there's a strict correlation between what's going to happen with the lending market. And of course, sometimes there is and sometimes there isn't. But tell me how you think about, you know, when you hear, ooh, the Fed's going to cut rates or they're going to raise rates. And does that mean anything to you? Are you, are you, does that sort of influence the way you can, you can, a conversate with clients or is it not that important for you? It's important to me because it's important to potential thoughts. If it wasn't for that, it wouldn't be very important to me at all because, first of all, when they talk about the Fed cutting interest rates, even if they cut at a 25 basis points, that means a quarter percent. If the 30 year mortgage dropped the same amount, 25 basis points, the difference in a mortgage, a 30 year mortgage from a slight decrease in the mortgage rates, is probably the equivalent of a Starbucks coffee per day. So it's not exactly moving the needle here. If you're going to get a 6% mortgage, it's at a 6 and a quarter. Oh, well, now things are going to start flying off the shelf. No, it's, it's negligible. So that's one thing about interest rates is that, just because the Fed's going to reduce interest rates is not a lock, first of all, that you're going to see if significant savings and your thing. That's not a lot. Number two, there is a fallacy that if the Fed cuts interest rates of mortgage rates automatically decline, and that is not true. And the reason for that in a nutshell is the mortgage rates are tied to the 10 year treasury bonds. Which is independent. It's not, has nothing to do with the Fed. It's been yielded on the 10 year treasury bond. It's really influenced by a whole host of factors. From inflation indicators, to sovereign wealth funds that are buying institutional, mutual funds, mom and pops that are buying T-bills and treasury bonds and stuff like that. That is really based on a lot of different factors. And so the Fed could cut interest rates and actually that 10 year yield could go up. Oh, wait a minute, you said the Fed cut rates to the yield of the bonds go down? Well, the Fed funds rates will go down, as that's what the Fed cut, but the 10 year could actually go up. If the market proceeds by the Fed cutting interest rates, if that's going to juice the economy, which can be inflationary, the 10 year and a 30 year bonds are going to be more sensitive to inflation and inflation-esque expectations than the argument the Fed is doing. So that's just something that, and it's happened in the not too just in past where the Fed has cut interest rates and the yield on the 10 year actually went higher. So this whole kind of, you know, wait for the Fed to cut, because then we're going to get rates at 4% of it. I've been following interest rates and paying attention to interest rates for 40 years now. And I mean, for a really, really long time, we lived in nothing but a really low and higher interest rate economy. I mean, it's almost forgetting about that. It's only been a couple of years, right? It already seems like it's a distant memory. It's probably been about four years. But we would really low interest rates. You had European central banks that had negative interest rates. You had to basically pay them to hold your money. So when I saw something, I don't know if it's the Wall Street Journal or a grants interest rate observer or something like that, he's an expert on interest rates and he said interest rates are at 5,000 year lows. That resonated with me. I'm like, we're going back to the pyramids in Egypt. You know what I mean? It's like, Tim Common got a 30 year fix in the bank. So I was like, this is unbelievable. 5,000 years, this guy, this is all he does. He's like a subcontent, just studies interest rates. That's his thing. So I was like, I said to my wife, I think it might be time to refinance. You know, or pull some money out and take out, you know, increase the amount of mortgage, pull some money out, which I'm pretty sure that I could invest in a higher rate. And that's the whole thing about whether you pay a mortgage. So if you're going to 2.75 mortgage rate, that's your cost of capital. You're going to get a tax write off on that, by the way. Sure. It is interest in the media. So it's probably, I don't know, let's call it 20% off sale. So it's probably like a 2.35 is your effective interest rate. Now at the time, treasury bills were yielding like next to nothing. Right. So it was hard to beat the 2.35 without taking some risk by putting it in stock market. Right. So you could short term interest rates at, you know, 4%, they would probably have 4.5 to 10 years, somewhere around 4.2. So you don't have to do anything. You could take that money that you borrowed and put it over here in a pretty safe investment and have a positive carry. You're basically, you're earning more. And that's the whole reason when you say when you paid mortgage off earlier. It's like, could you do better with the money? Right, sure. If I could have 3% mortgage and I think I can do better than 3%, why would I pay my mortgage off sooner? Well, yeah, if you can put that money in a bond environment, which of course, a lot more stable, didn't yeah. It's kind of a no-brainer. And just for... It depends on the excuse me. Just so people will think that bonds are all too safe and necessary. Depending on the duration of the bond, if you have a 30-year bond, and as you saw in 20, I think there's 2022, interest rates backed up pretty big time. So people that are thinking they've done nothing but positive returns on the bond market. The interest rates have done nothing but drops in 1982. That old suddenly for one of the first times, early 90s interest rates backed up. But we had a pretty severe backup at interest rates in 2022 and people actually lost money in bond funds. So it can happen. If you keep a shorter duration, 3.6 months, one in two-year treasury bills and notes, you're pretty much not going to lose a whole lot of bond. You go to a 30-year further out on the curve, to 30 years, there's way more risk because nobody knows where interest rates are going to be in 30 years, little or five years. So they've got to be paid for that. I need more money. I need a higher interest rate for me to take the risk of lending you money for 30 years. And that's the reason why the further you go out, the higher the interest rates. Yeah, well, it's a really interesting idea, though, of taking equity out, putting it in the market in whatever matches your risk tolerance and seeing what happens. And certainly. I hope your viewership is not sound asleep with the discussion of interest rates and historical interest rates that have all the half-year audience with that segment. No, I think it's important to talk about because we are at a rate where we are today, which is still historically pretty low. But in relation to 2021, 2021, 2022, it seems much higher. And you have just a lot of people who are sitting on the sidelines. And as a result, that's conversations that agents have to have is let's talk about where rates are, date the rate, marry the home, having conversations about that and also talking to homeowners who are at 2.75 and going, I don't really do anything right now and having to sort of explain, well, here's what happens if rates do go down and all this competition floods the market and if you are looking to make a decision or make a switch, then there's some consequence to that as well. So yeah, I think it's important. I also wanted to ask you really specifically about setting yourself apart from other agents, right? From others. And I know this is something that we've talked about throughout this conversation. So it's not something that we haven't touched on. But really figuring out, I know you talked about sort of what makes you tick. What makes you different? Can you speak to that a little bit? Like figuring out what drives you. Tell us what drives you. You know, you may have already said this, but curious to get your thoughts. Let me backtrack one second. I'm just curious that there's ever been a study done on how many marriages are still together because they have a 2.75 mortgage rate. Probably more than a few. Yeah, they're like, man, I can't stand my spouse in any kind of a board to leave. I got, I can't, I'm out of here. We're gonna have to sell the house and I lose this mortgage. I'm gonna tough to sell. If they had a barrier, the water was up to 5.5%, somebody's DOA, they're kicking that spouse out. But yeah, so I wonder if that, I tell people all the time, I'm like, don't move. And like, that's not good for your business, is it? I said, but it's genuine. All right, so what are we talking about? Oh, what drives me? Well, I didn't know it drove me for the first, I gotta say a couple of years. And I'm not saying that that's an exercise that all agents need to do, who's the figure I will drive. And I think, you know, you get to a certain, maybe it's just who I am or you get to a certain age, you just get a little bit more contemplative and you're thinking about things maybe more instead of just kicking out with your life. But I needed that. For me, to be motivated, I needed to figure out what it is that I wanted. Like, I know the first career of Wall Street, it was all about making money. I was 22 years old. I came right out of school and wasn't the smartest kid in my class and then have the best grades. But I was very financially motivated from a young age. And not financially motivated to be rich so I could drive a Lamborghini. It was really just like, it was the game of it. Like, just to accumulate money, no barriers. Then as I started realizing, I was like, I just want to make money so that I don't, I have freedom. It was about freedom. Having the ability to not panic if I lost my job or have the freedom to maybe at some point not work to 70. So that was, you know, that kind of what drove me in that first career, it was financially motivated. That's why I was confused with this one because the teaching thing would have been easy. I know what drove me on that was to make kids love history or make them think school wasn't suck and be one of those teachers that could be special. Real estate had no idea. I was basically, you know, what they say, fake it to you and make it. I didn't know what I was doing there. I didn't know why I was doing it. I just needed something to keep me busy, have purpose. So I was searching after a year or two to just try to figure out, was I knew it was important for me to figure out what drives me because if I don't, I don't know how long I stick at this because I need that as a motivator. And it finally occurred to me what really drove me was providing value. I don't know if it's just I'm a cheap S.O.B. by nature. Maybe that's what it is. But I just feel like, I'm like, what are these people were? What would ever somebody says, this is what it costs them? Like that seems like a lot of money. Like how long does that take until you actually do the job and you're like, oh, this is a nightmare. So I was like, I'm sure, I'm sure that everybody says, like, oh, real estate agents make way too much. So it was almost like a mission for me to prove that, first of all, I tell them, listen, the listing is, you know, whatever the percentage is, I don't get to keep all of it. I said, I got a company that's got to get paid. And I said, you know, then I have to pay taxes on. I have no healthcare, I'm an independent contractor. So I don't want you to think I'm getting, you know, I'm buying a yacht next week on the back of this commission. So part of it was, I didn't want, I wanted them to feel like that was providing value. So I was like, how do I do that? And you can't predict it all the time how you're going to provide value. Sometimes it's going to be in negotiations with a potential buyer or running up multiple law for situation. So it's going to provide value that way. But I provided value in ways that I never, never knew that was going to even happen. I had one house that I was sold at the back in 2018 or 19. And it was about a $2.5 million house. And it was a summertime and around this part of New Jersey, a lot of people go down to shore. I don't have a shore house. And I was probably the only schmuck in August that was sweating and walking around in streets of Madison, New Jersey with no summer house and no good vacation spot to go to. So the seller texted me, I think, from the beach and says, listen, we've got the giant trees that are on the edge of our property. I mean, like 75, 80 feet high oak trees that are gigantic and they're dead. And I think it's on the town's property. It's the town had a section of land that was right next to the house. I said, let me call somebody from the town. And I meet the guy over there and he goes, ah, this is on the homeowner's property. So I call a tree surgeon, tree guy to come in. I said, hey, Chris, how much does this got a cost? Because these are big trees. And he goes, they are dead and they can fall on the car or kill somebody. They really do need to come out. I said, how much is it? He goes, like, seven grand. It's a lot of money, big trees. So I said to the seller, hey, listen, do you guys have a survey of your property? The house is only like 10, actually six years old. Yeah, we have a survey of them last. So if you go into the house, tells you what the survey is. I take a tape measure and I walk off on a tape measure from the side edge of the house to the property one. And I realized that the trees are like six or seven feet on the town's property. So I screenshot it, sent it to her. She said, he emails it to the town. The town said, no problem. I'll take it down. So it's a same as the former grand. And then I also fought their taxes for them, which they, I think she called the Spelker Rubas. They don't allow you to do it anymore. I called them up and I said, listen, this house is listed now below the assessed value. And the assessed value is 90% of what you think it will sell for. And they were like, all right, we'll kick the taxes down. So I think it was 8,000 bucks. So they didn't get the full benefit of the tax reduction. Whoever bought it, it was going to be a more attractive property because the taxes were 8,000 dollars less. So, hey, that's one thing. What a quick story. There was a lot of times at home inspections. The, they do a home inspection. Sometimes some home inspectors feel like they got to justify their expense. Yeah. I farm as many as as is wrong as possible. So it's almost like you're a defensive attorney. With the other side says, you know, this is what's wrong with the house. And then you have to go out and get your expert witnesses that come back and say, you know, you're guys fully, you know, like, so this was a condo and there was a fireplace. $10,000. They put a camera to fireplace. The guy says, yeah, it's about $10,000 worth of repairs. I'm like, that's a lot. So I bring an archimney guy and he's renowned in our area for being honest and good. And he goes, yeah, there's some problems with this chimney. I said, all right, well, lay it on me. What's it going to cost? He said, it's been about $1,200. I said, put it in writing immediately got it in writing, sent it over to the other agent. She recognized who was given this estimate, realized that he's very professional, very good. She immediately told her buyer, we gave a credit of $1,200. Now, if I don't get involved in that, and just let the attorneys deal with it, maybe the seller just goes, oh, I guess my chimney's best though, let's give him 10 grand off the price. I think what the attorney says, listen, we'll split the difference. And that would have been floodgrain, instead of $1,200. So again, that drives me, is defined a way I never can tell. I don't know if somebody's got trees, dead trees on property that's on the property line, or somebody's got a chimney that they're going to get ripped off on. I never know what's going to happen in the deal that I'm going to be able to provide value, but I'm almost looking for it. And if I can have somebody come out of the other end, I love to try to be able to pay for my own commission. And I point that out to him, I'm like, listen, the commission was 12 grand. I saved you 9,000 bucks. Can we agree that I only cost you three, and I was a good deal? And they laugh because most people just don't think like I do, but who just trying to always provide value today? I love that.
