[00:01:15] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:18] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:22] Now as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:23] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:26] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:29] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:31] Well, what if I were to tell you
[00:01:32] there's a recruiting and retention tool
[00:01:34] powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:36] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:40] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:42] and which agents at your own firm
[00:01:45] are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:47] Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:50] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:52] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:54] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:56] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:01:59] for each agent in your market
[00:02:01] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:04] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:06] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:09] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:11] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:13] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:15] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:19] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:21] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:23] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:25] Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:28] corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:31] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:34] That's corded.io and now onto the show.
[00:02:52] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real,
[00:02:55] the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents.
[00:02:58] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:00] I'm your guide.
[00:03:00] I'm your host through the show in just a moment.
[00:03:03] We're going to be speaking with top producer,
[00:03:04] Crystal Tran, one of my favorite people.
[00:03:07] She is amazing.
[00:03:08] You are going to love this conversation.
[00:03:10] Before we get to Crystal,

[00:03:23] And we will always try to improve our show to meet your needs.
[00:03:27] And also tell a friend,
[00:03:28] think of one of the REALTOR that could benefit
[00:03:30] from hearing these great conversations with top producers.
[00:03:32] Maybe a new REALTOR.
[00:03:33] Somebody you know is getting in the business,
[00:03:34] who needs a little step up in the right direction.
[00:03:38] And they need to hear what Crystal today is going to tell them.
[00:03:41] Shoot them a link over to our show.
[00:03:42] We appreciate it.
[00:03:43] And thank you to everyone for either being new listeners
[00:03:46] or returning listeners.
[00:03:47] We love you.
[00:03:48] And let's get right to it.
[00:03:49] My conversation with Crystal Tran.
[00:04:04] All right, tell me the best piece of advice you've received
[00:04:08] to real estate.
[00:04:10] Put your name on everything.
[00:04:11] Make it a brand and make it a logo.
[00:04:15] That's the best advice.
[00:04:16] You know, and I've curated all the way through.
[00:04:18] And it's really held me.
[00:04:21] It's still paying off, you know, to this day.
[00:04:23] So it's one of the first things I've ever established.
[00:04:25] And one of the best advices ever was like brand
[00:04:28] and market yourself your name and keep it consistent.
[00:04:32] Yeah, don't be a secret REALTOR.
[00:04:34] Don't be a secret REALTOR.
[00:04:36] Don't have different identities with all these different logos
[00:04:39] that keep changing be consistent.
[00:04:41] Yeah, I love that.
[00:04:43] And worst piece of advice you ever received.
[00:04:45] And worst piece of advice was you can only pick up clients
[00:04:49] through your sphere.
[00:04:50] And it is so natural because my whole team wouldn't exist
[00:04:53] if that was the case.
[00:04:57] So we probably work with, I would say,
[00:05:01] 80% of the buyers we work with are complete strangers.
[00:05:05] Wow.
[00:05:06] Yeah, sellers, you know, it's probably a little bit less.
[00:05:09] But it's definitely a big portion of our business
[00:05:12] where clients are finding us online or through AI,
[00:05:17] which is pretty cool.
[00:05:18] We get that feedback.
[00:05:19] We've gotten that a few times.
[00:05:21] So really exciting stuff ahead.
[00:05:23] I love that too because a lot of times people think
[00:05:27] the only way is through the network.
[00:05:30] And of course, for a lot of agents,
[00:05:31] that does kind of be their main source.
[00:05:34] And a lot of the people we have on the show
[00:05:36] that is how they grow.
[00:05:37] But it's not even as common as most of the people
[00:05:41] that we have on the show.
[00:05:42] Like a lot of them are that way, but a lot of them aren't.
[00:05:45] They have other lead sources.
[00:05:46] They're constantly getting people that do not know them
[00:05:49] into their sphere.
[00:05:50] And so we'll maybe we'll talk about a bit about how you do that
[00:05:54] today because a lot of times people listen to our show
[00:05:57] and they go, I don't have a big network.
[00:05:59] And maybe I just moved here or I just not really comfortable
[00:06:02] talking to my friends a lot about this.
[00:06:04] And so we can talk about how you guys get that.
[00:06:06] But my guest today is a returning guest to our show.
[00:06:09] She is a friend of mine and one of the top agents here
[00:06:13] in Chicago.
[00:06:13] I'm really honored to be her friend.
[00:06:16] I think she is just one of those lovely positive forces
[00:06:20] of this industry.
[00:06:21] She's a good person.
[00:06:22] And she has a wonderful team.
[00:06:24] And she actually just helped my girlfriends,
[00:06:28] fiancees.

[00:06:45] of the nicest people in this business.

[00:06:59] She's the creator of Agent Duty,

[00:08:16] I think their branding is really special
[00:08:18] and very intentional and very specific and very clean.
[00:08:23] And I just, I like it aesthetically.
[00:08:24] I like it.
[00:08:25] So Crystal, welcome back to the show.
[00:08:27] Thank you so much, DJ.
[00:08:28] So excited to always get on a call with you
[00:08:30] and chit chat about what's happening in the real estate space.
[00:08:34] I love it.
[00:08:34] We had to postpone our last one because we mistakenly
[00:08:39] scheduled it while I was on this vacation.
[00:08:42] And I was in the process of getting engaged.
[00:08:43] And so I miscommunicated that to my, my, my, my booker.
[00:08:48] And she, we had to reschedule and we had to explain why.
[00:08:51] And you sent a very nice note.
[00:08:53] So thank you for, for wishing me well ahead of the,
[00:08:56] that's so cool.
[00:08:57] I like it was just cool.
[00:08:59] I had this inside information like not too many people
[00:09:01] know that you're going to propose.
[00:09:02] And I was so privileged to feel like I was one of the first
[00:09:06] to know.
[00:09:06] So I was just waiting for the announcement.
[00:09:09] Yeah, yeah.
[00:09:10] And so now we just have all only about a million
[00:09:13] more things to do to get ready for it.
[00:09:15] But but we're almost there.
[00:09:16] I was telling Crystal ahead of time we got lucky and got a lot
[00:09:19] of things pre pre planned, which just kind of worked out.
[00:09:22] And so we did the things a little bit out of order, not by choice,
[00:09:25] but it worked out that way.
[00:09:27] And the proposal was actually about the last thing that we had to do.
[00:09:30] But it worked out really well.
[00:09:31] And now we can tell everybody and say, oh, by the way,
[00:09:33] we have all this stuff planned and, and, you know,
[00:09:36] you can just kind of cruise into it next year.
[00:09:38] So anyway, let's talk about you.
[00:09:39] So I want to hear about, you know, maybe we've been on our show
[00:09:45] before, but, you know, we gosh, probably hundreds of episodes ago.
[00:09:48] Is when you first came on and certainly we get new,
[00:09:50] new people listening every, every, every episode.
[00:09:54] We have brand new, a listener.
[00:09:55] So I want to hear a little bit about your story.
[00:09:57] Like tell us because you didn't start on a team or you didn't
[00:10:00] start as a, as a Crystal Tran team.
[00:10:02] But tell us how you, how you got into real estate and sort of how
[00:10:04] you grew and, and how you built your own team.
[00:10:06] Yeah.
[00:10:07] So I think in 2012, I was living out in LA and I decided to get
[00:10:11] licensed out in California, worked for a top producer for RE/MAX
[00:10:15] and really helped him handle his short sale files.
[00:10:20] So that was, you know, bottom of the market, 2012, 2013.
[00:10:24] So my first experience was it, was a California agent.
[00:10:28] And it's definitely, you know, when you're short,
[00:10:30] short-sailing, really nice, beautiful homes.
[00:10:33] It's definitely, it's fun experience, though, you know,
[00:10:36] with this extra layer of, of the market that I was really happy
[00:10:40] that I had the opportunity to learn right away, you know,
[00:10:43] because there's some agents that get into this industry and they
[00:10:46] never know what a down market is.
[00:10:47] They only know up.
[00:10:49] So I started in the down market.
[00:10:50] And so I decided that LA wasn't for me and I returned back home and
[00:10:56] went back to the block that I knew, which was in downtown
[00:10:59] Winakka.
[00:11:00] I had worked on that block for a very long time as a hairstylist
[00:11:04] at a place called Sizzar's Edge Slon that's still there today.
[00:11:07] I spent about 13 years there.
[00:11:10] And, you know, just I loved, you know, the creativity of being a
[00:11:14] stylist and working with people and having clients that concept of
[00:11:18] being able to build these relationships is cool.
[00:11:21] So real estate was just like an instant kind of pool for me.
[00:11:25] So I started out at Cannington Stray in the Winakka office,
[00:11:29] which was fun fact, the office that was in the Ferris Bueller's
[00:11:33] Ferris Bueller.
[00:11:34] Oh, Gene Bueller.
[00:11:36] That was that.
[00:11:37] That's funny.
[00:11:38] Yeah.
[00:11:39] So now, now they've closed that office.
[00:11:42] So I've been, you know, probably like two, three years ago, you
[00:11:46] know, moved over to Atts.
[00:11:47] So I was really at Cannington Stray, a Berkshire Hathaway Canning
[00:11:51] Rubeloff for a good 10 years of my career.
[00:11:56] And that's really like, I think after year five, my sister had
[00:12:00] reached out to me and she said, Hey, my friend Natasha, she's
[00:12:04] getting licensed, you know, she just wants to kind of assist and
[00:12:07] get involved a little bit.
[00:12:08] Would you be open to letting her shadow you?
[00:12:11] So I brought Natasha on.
[00:12:12] Kassam, Natasha, Kassam on as my assistant.
[00:12:16] And she got licensed and then all of a sudden I was like, well,
[00:12:19] we're a team now.
[00:12:20] So the team got developed kind of accidentally and and and then
[00:12:27] probably a year later, my friend Selma, who I had known probably
[00:12:31] since I was 18 reached out and said, Hey, I really resonate with
[00:12:34] your brand, what you're doing, you know, and I want to be a part
[00:12:38] of of your team.
[00:12:39] Would you bring me on and coach me?
[00:12:41] And so she was my second hire.
[00:12:43] Those two are still with me until today eight years later.
[00:12:46] And so, you know, when I became like when I when I started my
[00:12:49] team, I wasn't like this crazy top producer.
[00:12:51] I didn't have huge amounts of, you know, leads coming in and
[00:12:57] clientele.
[00:12:58] I just was willing to show them what I had known and they were
[00:13:03] starting to develop their own business.
[00:13:05] And so, you know, with them helping me and giving me more time to
[00:13:09] work on the brand, build the social media, build the marketing
[00:13:13] because it takes a lot of time, you know.
[00:13:15] So, so really that's how we got started was like by accident.
[00:13:18] And now we're a team of I believe we're about 22, 22 agents
[00:13:23] right now.
[00:13:24] Yeah.
[00:13:24] Wow.
[00:13:24] And still growing.
[00:13:25] Still growing.
[00:13:26] Yes.
[00:13:26] Very much still growing.
[00:13:28] We really, I mean, our goal, I think by the end of 2026 is to be a
[00:13:32] team of 30 if not more.
[00:13:34] So we feel very confident in, you know, the pace that we're moving
[00:13:38] at, even with 20, 22 agents right now, you know, everyone's not
[00:13:43] fully involved, but it's manageable.
[00:13:45] I have an ops manager where everyone's feeling attended to
[00:13:48] we have systems in place and, you know, there's there's a lot of
[00:13:53] great positive points on why somebody would join our team, you know,
[00:13:56] then, then to be a solo agent.
[00:13:58] I have had agents who have started out solo and joined our team,
[00:14:02] agents have who have come from other teams or agents that have done
[00:14:06] it for a long time on their own and just have said, I like, I've had
[00:14:09] enough.
[00:14:10] I can't do this anymore.
[00:14:11] The one-man show is really hard.
[00:14:13] And it's hard to constantly remodivate yourself all the time.
[00:14:18] Yes.
[00:14:19] I play.
[00:14:19] Boy, that is, that is not, that is such a, such a truth because you do have
[00:14:25] to wear every hat and you just aren't going to be good at everything, right?
[00:14:29] Like the skills are just too different, right?
[00:14:31] So there's, there's the skills of interpersonal skills of, you know,
[00:14:35] working with clients and meeting their needs and being emotionally
[00:14:39] meeting their needs and being really good at the job and then doing all
[00:14:42] of the, all the sort of operational stuff when it comes to numbers and
[00:14:47] metrics and, and, and understanding, you know, just how the job works and,
[00:14:51] and also just all the compliance and it, it's just so many different
[00:14:55] skills that people aren't going to be skilled in all of that.
[00:14:59] And it's certainly tough to be a solo agent, I think, these days.
[00:15:02] And, and then solo agents are competing with, with teams.
[00:15:05] And I think that's tough too because teams have kind of figured out
[00:15:08] their strength and numbers and your team is, is a, is it an example of that?
[00:15:12] And you do something very unique.
[00:15:14] Well, actually, before we talk about your team, I want to talk about your
[00:15:17] brand and then I want to get to your team because I always, we'll forget to
[00:15:20] talk about this on the show is your brand person.
[00:15:24] Tell me what, when you think of your brand, what comes to mind?
[00:15:27] Like what are the, what are the characteristics of your brand that you sort
[00:15:31] of want your clients to think about when they, when they think about you?
[00:15:36] Professional.
[00:15:37] That's definitely number one.
[00:15:40] Systematic.
[00:15:42] It's something about, you know, it's, it's, the logo is very crisp, clean,
[00:15:46] but has like a creative side to it, right?
[00:15:48] With some color, a little cursive, but for the most part, it's very balanced.
[00:15:53] A lot of harmony to it, right?
[00:15:55] Because that is, you know, it really just embodies us overall, like the professionalism,
[00:16:02] you know, how systematic we are and, and bringing that harmony to a sale, right?
[00:16:06] Because it's like, it kind of have to be all these different moving parts, right?
[00:16:10] You've got to be authoritative to, you know, a client when they're not listening
[00:16:14] to you or not really understanding the market, but then you have to be the tough guy
[00:16:18] when it comes to negotiating and then you've got to be the soft one when, you know,
[00:16:21] it's something a little bit more of a touchy reason and why they're selling, you know,
[00:16:24] whether there's a divorce or a family death, you know, then you've really got to embody
[00:16:30] all these parts, but I really think that, you know, our logo is like very a strategic look
[00:16:37] and people instantly recognize it and they'll just say, oh yeah, I, and, you know,
[00:16:42] the hard part is I always have this marketing friend who's always trying to get me to change my logo.
[00:16:47] He's like, you got to modernize it and I just like, I'm having a hard time letting go of it,
[00:16:52] you know, because I, to me, I think it's great, but, um, I, yeah, I, I don't think I want to change
[00:16:59] it anytime soon, but I totally get, you know, all this modernization of, you know, you always have
[00:17:03] to evolve in this industry and it's the same thing with brands and logos too, right?
[00:17:07] A reborn of your, of your brand, a reborn of, you know, maybe that look has changed now.
[00:17:14] Maybe we're a little bit more edgy. Maybe we service a different kind of clientele, you know,
[00:17:19] but I would say our brand really exemplifies like luxury is when you say that.
[00:17:24] Yeah, yeah, luxury for sure. And I also think there's some, I don't know, it comes across
[00:17:30] in knowing you personally and your team personally is there's, and I think this comes through in
[00:17:38] the, in the aesthetic is there's a kindness to your team. I think that goes a long way and is really,
[00:17:47] not talked about enough, I think, in this business where kindness and compassion and being just a
[00:17:52] nice good person goes a really long way and allows for you to, for agents to be a bit imperfect,
[00:17:58] right? If you're, if you're make mistakes, which we all do, if you're also like a really nice good
[00:18:03] person, the clients usually are pretty forgiving, but I think like you're just a solid nice person
[00:18:08] and your team's very sweet and nice and, and I, and they're also very aggressive and very,
[00:18:13] you know, intentional and, and they're very professional. I think that, that kindness and compassion
[00:18:18] that really goes a long way and, and people, when they think about your brand, I think there's a
[00:18:23] smile that maybe people have about it and I think that isn't maybe everybody's brand and, and I
[00:18:28] think that probably serves, serves you well. I agree. Yeah, I could tell you agree with that because
[00:18:33] it's like there's some agents out there that will never smile on their profile photo and when you meet
[00:18:38] them, they don't smile and there's no like, there's no brightness to them, they're not shiny,
[00:18:43] they're very dark, they're very dull, they're very, you know, and for us, it's like the reason why,
[00:18:48] you know, we're just not nice to be nice, but we just, we're really like, we really want to understand
[00:18:52] what's going on, you know, like, what's going on in their lives and a lot of the times, like,
[00:18:56] there's something bigger going on than just making a move. And if you want someone to open up to you,
[00:19:02] you really have to be, you know, just, you have to be inviting, you have to be a warm smile, like,
[00:19:09] if people don't get a chance to open up to you, then you really don't get to the bottom of what's
[00:19:13] driving the sale. Yeah. Because a lot of the times, you know, when we're buying and selling, it's,
[00:19:18] it's very emotional. So it allows us to connect with our clients a lot more and it really helps us,
[00:19:24] you know, fine tune the process of, hey, where do we need to be a little bit more sensitive? Where do we,
[00:19:30] you know, who do we, who needs to be involved? But I think when we stay focused on that, it really
[00:19:35] takes us through the transaction and makes the service, you know, really top tier service because
[00:19:42] we're not worried about the commission, we're not worried about, you know, are they, are they
[00:19:46] going to be pre-approved for this or that we're worried about what's happening in their lives?
[00:19:50] Yeah. And, and we're able to connect with them a lot more and then it really doesn't seem
[00:19:54] transactional, you know, and that's when we're winning and the client is winning, as long as the
[00:19:58] client is winning, we're winning. So it really helps. Yeah, and there's, there's people that come
[00:20:02] through, we always think about, you know, home buyers that are choosing to buy, but then there's
[00:20:07] people who going through divorce or people that are going through a death and they have to move.
[00:20:12] There's something that's forcing them to make this transaction and it might not be something they
[00:20:18] necessarily are super thrilled to be going through while they're doing this very difficult task
[00:20:23] of buying or selling a property. And so I think you're right, like there's that sensitivity of like,
[00:20:27] hey, the agents that are the clients that we have that are, you know, going through a tougher
[00:20:31] life moment, like we can still be there and and give them, you know, an extra layer of attention or,
[00:20:37] or, you know, sort of kindness that really will help them. And then those people are become so
[00:20:43] grateful, I think, the people that are having a hard time going through this with a team that
[00:20:48] really is kind to them with their circumstance so that they're going to tell everybody about you,
[00:20:53] right? Like I was going through a rough patch. I had to do this thing and the, you know, the
[00:20:57] Crystal Tran team like really helped me through that. And certainly the, you know, the people that
[00:21:03] are the estate planning attorneys, the divorce attorneys, you know, the ones who have to deal with
[00:21:07] with these sort of situations and refer agents, you know, they love agents like you or your team
[00:21:12] because you guys are really kind and compassionate. So anyway, but let's, yeah, let's talk about your
[00:21:19] team because I think in addition to your brand, I think what you actually offer your team is quite
[00:21:26] compelling and there aren't a lot of teams that are able to offer what you offer. And I think
[00:21:32] there's something very special about, you know, the what attracts agents to your team. And,
[00:21:39] yes, you're going to teach somebody how to build their business organically. Of course,
[00:21:44] that's a huge part of your business. But you said it earlier that 80% of the business really is
[00:21:50] is coming from other sources. And so you have what again, to me is such an attractive compelling
[00:21:58] answer to an agent that maybe their strong suit isn't getting out there and doing lead generation
[00:22:05] or reaching out to people and meeting people like maybe they're more introverted or maybe they're
[00:22:10] just like it's just not what they're good at. They're good at running the numbers or doing other
[00:22:14] things in the business. And you know, you have to just get out and meet a lot of people. And you've
[00:22:19] sort of helped solve for that for agents that are either newer or not newer. And necessarily,
[00:22:24] you said you have agents that have been doing this a long time would join your team and really are
[00:22:28] looking for some other lead opportunities. And you sort of have that. And I think, you know,
[00:22:34] that's something I'd love to talk about. So talk to us about sort of, you know, what you provide
[00:22:39] for your team that is unique. Well, I mean, every year we're constantly leveling up. So I would say
[00:22:47] our systems are pretty, you know, we're pretty, we're pretty like heavily text-stacked right now.
[00:22:52] So if an agent coming in, they're getting access to follow-up boss, which is an amazing platform.
[00:22:59] As you know, it really does, it's a very dynamic system. So it does a lot. We have YLOPO, which is like
[00:23:06] a force registration website that the agents can appear on every single listing page. So if they
[00:23:13] you know want to market a property, then if someone clicks on the link, then they could see
[00:23:17] the agent on that page rather than somebody else. So each agent has their own custom, you know,
[00:23:24] website. We have Maverick, which is a really cool tool. It's one of a new platform that we're kind of,
[00:23:30] it's integrated into follow-up boss, but it allows, it's an AI system that allows your team to practice,
[00:23:36] do practice calls, right? Yeah. Getting the rejection, getting the the mad seller, getting the
[00:23:41] disconcerned buyer, how to, you know, give your pitch and get feedback and give some feedback
[00:23:48] about where they can make some improvements and, you know, maybe using some, using, you know,
[00:23:53] rephrasing sentences for that. Instead of saying this, try saying this, right? And so with that,
[00:23:59] you're getting a lot of guidance. Because I think when you start as a REALTOR, you're getting so
[00:24:05] many things thrown at you. And it's almost impossible to stay on top of like what's really important,
[00:24:10] what's really going to move the noodle, noodle needle. You see where my head is at.
[00:24:19] But it's just a lot going at you. And you're kind of like your own CEO going, well, hey,
[00:24:25] you're building a business today. What do you want to build it out of sticks, paper, you know?
[00:24:29] And it's like, you get all these options and like you just don't know, you could go down like
[00:24:33] this long road of something where you're just like fully invested. And then a year later come
[00:24:39] to find out it wasn't a good investment. It wasn't a great way to invest your time. So like we have
[00:24:44] systems, you know, very well put systems in place and training to help the agents stay focused on
[00:24:50] what they should stay focused on, which is really growing their brand and marketing. And I know it just,
[00:24:57] when people say marketing, it just sounds like this one word that is such a blanket of everything.
[00:25:01] But like marketing just encompasses so many things, you know, visually how people perceive you
[00:25:06] in person, your marketing brochures, your online presence, you know, your headshot, your bios.
[00:25:12] There's just so much, are you posting videos? Are you using, you know, very like, are using
[00:25:20] Chatchee BT? It's part of it, right? Because that's really moving the needle now. So, so we just have
[00:25:27] all these systems in place and we really have them on like the right track. Because sometimes,
[00:25:33] they'll come in, they'll spend their wheels for like six hours a day going, oh, I had such a busy
[00:25:38] day. And I'm like, okay, well, what'd you do? Well, well, that didn't make you any money and that's
[00:25:42] really, you know, not a good, you know, time, you a good, a good use of your time, right? So let's
[00:25:48] let's refocus you on what's really important. And like even though it might be hair pulling,
[00:25:54] just know that if you get this done, it's going to help move the needle for you and that you're not
[00:25:58] wasting time in other places and doing, you know, having lunches with 30 lenders a year, right?
[00:26:06] That's, that's not helping you, right? So your time is, so we're teaching them a lot about those
[00:26:11] things, right? Like time management, the CRMs and really getting them prepped to the point where
[00:26:18] we feel comfortable with giving them lead flow. So we have two kinds of, you know, a few different
[00:26:24] kinds of lead flow. We'll have renter luxury leasing lead flow. We'll have buyers and we have
[00:26:30] sellers. The most ones we have are probably the buyers and renters. But, you know, this year was
[00:26:37] a very challenging year with rentals. It, the highest prices we've seen in a very long time in
[00:26:44] Chicago for rentals. And so, you know, I think there's that bent up demand from people either
[00:26:49] renewing their lease and they don't want to move because they don't, you know, they, they maybe
[00:26:54] thought they wanted to buy, but the rates are too high. So they're staying put. But, you know,
[00:27:01] going back around to the agent, it's like we're giving them all the tools and only the ones that
[00:27:06] they should use in their toolbox. We should, we should mention, I'm sorry to interrupt, I was
[00:27:11] going to say, we should mention that a lot of the tools you mentioned are tools you provide.
[00:27:16] You know, these are tools that you pay for for your team. They're not necessarily provided by
[00:27:21] your brokerage. Who, by the way, is one of the very best brokerages. If not the very best, you know,
[00:27:27] perceived brokerage brand here in Chicago who has unbelievable tools of their own. And yet, you've
[00:27:34] gone out and purchased additional tools. And, you know, when I think about the tools you mentioned,
[00:27:39] and I know the prices of those tools, and they are very expensive. And so, you know, another reason
[00:27:45] to consider joining a team in addition to all the coaching and the training and they're going to
[00:27:49] help you sort of figure out what to do every day is just getting access to some of these tools. Because,
[00:27:53] you know, we have a great tool set here at our company as well. I mean, we really do. And very few
[00:27:59] of our agents really take advantage of it, you know, and we think it's great. And the agents,
[00:28:04] some of them use it and a lot of them don't. And, you know, you're a team that you guys are boots
[00:28:09] on the ground like you're out there practicing your team's practicing. You know what works. And so,
[00:28:13] you're like, well, you know, the company has all these great tools, but we're going to give you
[00:28:16] this other suite of tools that we know is really un unbelievably effective. And I think that's also
[00:28:22] something that is kind of unique that you provide is these additional resources that, you know,
[00:28:28] maybe their firm already has a bunch of tools, but they don't use them or maybe they're not very good.
[00:28:32] And then you're able to bring in this additional suite.
[00:28:36] Yeah. Now, it's definitely been a game changer for us and has positioned us in a way that we have
[00:28:41] so much more to offer the agent, you know, even more stuff to offer the agent, which is exciting.
[00:28:46] And it really gives me like as, as, you know, being able to get like an bird's eye view of what's
[00:28:53] happening with the team. How many clients are we working with? How many how many leads are coming in?
[00:28:57] Who's talking to who who's on leader board? You know, are the agents putting in more calls this
[00:29:02] week? Are they not right? Because before I had I had no idea. I'd give someone a lead. I'd
[00:29:07] pray for them and say, hope you get it closed. Let me know when it closes. Now I could actually
[00:29:11] follow up and I could say, hey, you know, I've given you five of these leads. What's going on with
[00:29:16] them? I see that you haven't followed up, right? So there's a little bit more accountability on the team.
[00:29:22] And for someone that has a lot of lead flows because we have buyer and seller leads from like,
[00:29:26] we have a Zillow flex team. So that's obviously our biggest lead flow. And then we have Hunt Chicago,
[00:29:31] which is the primary website. Crystal Tran team is our Y-Lopo website. So two different kind of
[00:29:38] websites. Hunt Chicago, you would probably find through like an organic search. Crystal Tran
[00:29:44] team is something that you would probably find on our Instagram page or if we're marketing a property,
[00:29:49] we generally push that website out because it's forced registration. So it's Hunt Chicago, but I think
[00:29:54] the Crystal Tran team website has a better IDX. So it's much more user friendly. It's
[00:30:00] and it really has like this guided forced registration where it's kind of fun for buyers.
[00:30:06] Like it's already like predetermined like four answers, you know, like when are you looking to move
[00:30:11] one month, two month, you know, three months to six months and they just like going through there
[00:30:15] and just clicking, clicking, clicking. And so we have agents who are, you know, pulling in a lot of
[00:30:20] social media leads into Crystal Tran team and then getting that forced registration. And in that
[00:30:27] forced registration, we're getting so much information about them, whether they need to sell before
[00:30:31] they buy, whether they've been pre-approved, are they working with an agent, you know, and it's
[00:30:36] just nice to have all this data on people. And same thing with follow up bosses like when it's
[00:30:43] tied to Zillow now, I mean 85% of the people search on Zillow. So we actually could see their activity
[00:30:48] and it's just nice. Like wow, hey, I could call John and say, hey John, I just saw you started looking
[00:30:53] at dislains. Like what's going on there? We've been looking in Lakeview. Are you thinking about
[00:30:57] making a switch to the burps, right? So it gives us, it allows us to follow up with a client with more intent.
[00:31:04] So it just, you know, back in the day, it was like when I started, it was just kind of like this big
[00:31:08] question mark, you know, you were like praying, okay, I'm going to send out this post-credit parade.
[00:31:12] I'm going to, you know, like call my friends and pray so someone's going to reach out to me. Whereas
[00:31:16] like with follow up bosses, a lot more intention of like, hey, we know that they're looking. We know
[00:31:22] that they've saved properties or shared a link with their friend, right? Which is usually a good
[00:31:26] sign. They share a link. It's like, oh, okay, well, they're really interested. So, you know, and like with,
[00:31:33] I mean, app properties is amazing. Don't get me wrong. The reason why I went to app properties is
[00:31:36] because they have, you know, the app properties brand is amazing. Then they, you know, combined with
[00:31:41] Christie's, which made it like a no brainer for me, which had the international presence. But they
[00:31:47] just don't have the CRM that we have. They don't have like app properties. You get a landing page
[00:31:53] for a website. But, you know, if someone goes and searches on there, they might not necessarily come
[00:31:59] back to me. Right. They might go back to an app properties portal where they might give it to the
[00:32:04] listening agent. Or so it's it. I mean, I get a few leads from app properties like the website
[00:32:12] because maybe someone has like vetted us through Zillow and then went through app properties to
[00:32:17] make contact with us. Right. So, so all of the, I mean, they all matter. Don't get me wrong. They
[00:32:23] really do all matter. But we're just working in a way that's so different than like the rest of
[00:32:29] the company, which feels kind of cool because not that we want to be different, but because, you know,
[00:32:35] like things are always changing very quickly in tech and in teams in real estate. As we know,
[00:32:41] and it's like we have to stand top of it, right. And it's like what are the latest greatest tools
[00:32:46] that are going to help make our lives easier? Yeah. And brokerages oftentimes big, big brands like
[00:32:52] like app properties, they have multi-year relationships with certain tools and it's they're not easily
[00:32:58] able to net to say we're going to drop this one in switch to another one. And also half their agents
[00:33:03] would would freak out because they don't have to learn a new system. And so you're able to,
[00:33:08] it's kind of like the battleship and the bathtub. It's harder to navigate quickly.
[00:33:12] I'm there. The tool sets great. But when something better comes along, it's not super easy for them
[00:33:16] to just swap out a one into another. They've got a lot invested in this existing tool, whereas
[00:33:20] you can swap it in out of things much more easily and you can stay a little bit ahead of the curve
[00:33:25] there. And, you know, brokerages, you know, we have a brokerage. I know how hard it is for us to
[00:33:31] switch tools. And we just don't ever want to as a brokerage because it's a huge nightmare. And so,
[00:33:36] you want to just pick the right one. But of course, the right one doesn't stay the right one forever.
[00:33:41] And so you're have this ability to kind of swap it in out. And I wanted to mention one of the tools
[00:33:45] you you mentioned, which is really about skill building. And I think this is a really big,
[00:33:50] unique value that you provide because, you know, I was thinking about this just today because I
[00:33:56] recruit agents and that's my my job. And what I do is it's like really simple. If I want to like
[00:34:02] increase my the number of people I recruit every year, I've kind of like two options. I can
[00:34:06] increase the number of people I talk to and or I can increase my skill. And when I talk to those
[00:34:12] people, right? So if I don't increase my skill and I just double the number of people I talk to,
[00:34:17] I'll probably double the number of people I recruit, but I have to double the number of people I
[00:34:21] talk to. And that's tough. If I can work on my skill of recruiting and like what, you know,
[00:34:27] keep figuring out what people really need in a brokerage, how to communicate that and, and, you know,
[00:34:32] get more effective that way, then maybe I don't have to meet twice as many people. My close ratio
[00:34:37] would just go up and the easy thing to do is to meet new people. That's actually easier than
[00:34:43] building my skill for me because there's 46,000 REALTORS here in Chicago. I can always meet a new
[00:34:48] agent. I'm sorry, I can always meet somebody who I've never met before. And it's easy to meet new
[00:34:53] agents are, again, I keep saying new. I don't mean new to the business, necessarily, but just new to
[00:34:57] me. And it's so easy to find that. I can, I, you know, I have all the agents here and it's not easy
[00:35:04] to increase my skill. And you're taught, you help people do both, but you also help them build their
[00:35:10] skill. And that is really, really important. You know, it's something that I think many REALTORS
[00:35:17] overlook is how do I keep increasing? How do I keep doing those push-ups to get stronger? It's
[00:35:24] certainly easy to keep posting on social media, creating content, calling your existing clients,
[00:35:29] and all of that is really important. And then there's this other piece that's like maybe that's
[00:35:33] not as much fun, and it hurts a little bit more. And it's just not as like a sexy, but this,
[00:35:39] I'm going to work on the skill. And I'm just going to like get hit with these objections and figure
[00:35:44] out a better way to do it. And, hey, I can help you do that. You've got other tools to help you do
[00:35:48] that. Can you talk a little bit about that skill building and why it's so important?
[00:35:51] Well, the skill building tool is called Maverick, and it's an extension into follow-up boss, but,
[00:35:57] you know, overcoming objections is the biggest issue that we all have. We usually, you know,
[00:36:02] first objection, we're dead in the water, it's done, it's over, okay, have a good life,
[00:36:05] a move on, right? And so, you know, that's one level of it, right? It's, you know, getting the
[00:36:12] agents more confident about getting rejected by an AI machine and learning that, and then not
[00:36:17] being so shocked by it when it happens the first time or not knowing how to respond. And then the
[00:36:22] other side of it is like pitching your business. Well, why should I work with you? You know,
[00:36:28] what is your system? What do you do? What do you know, walk me through the process? What,
[00:36:32] and then get to the fee? How do you present the fee, you know, without getting pushback? And so,
[00:36:39] we're kind of dealing with a lot of those things, right? Whether it's the percentage or they don't
[00:36:43] assign for a year, you know, and it's challenging because like the Zillow Flex leads, they don't know who
[00:36:49] we are. Like these people that don't know who we are now, we have to say the year agreement, well,
[00:36:55] it's definitely a lot easier now that we have the reputation. Because like, once you build the
[00:37:00] marketing, that's when you start to build the reputation. And now because we have such a very long
[00:37:05] standing reputation, it's a lot easier for us to build a trust with the clients. So, you know,
[00:37:11] other things you have to learn is like learning how to say no. You know, that's something we coach
[00:37:17] on. It's like once we get through, you know, just like if you don't improve your skill set,
[00:37:22] then you're kind of constantly getting the same result. And if you're not relating to people,
[00:37:27] then you've got to switch how, you know, you have to change up how you're delivering that message.
[00:37:33] Like, do you have an agent? Oh, has anyone been helping you with your home search? I mean,
[00:37:37] those two basically say the same thing, but it like one is much softer and inviting, whereas the
[00:37:42] other one is just like, whoa, okay, well, back up, you know, I would be, I wouldn't like that question.
[00:37:48] It would make me put my guard up. So it really is, it's like the finesse of like tango dancing with
[00:37:53] the client, right? You want to be push a little bit to get a reaction out of them, see what they have
[00:37:58] to say, what their curiosity is. And then rebuttal in a way that's going to actually make them happy.
[00:38:05] So my one, like, I have a trick that I like to do is if somebody comes in an appointment and they're like,
[00:38:11] well, well, when are you going to, are you going to be available to show me these homes? Well,
[00:38:15] and I'll say, well, yeah, definitely, it's really our priority. Like, if a new home pops up in
[00:38:19] the market, you know, I'll want you to get in the same day. So I took their worry and then amplified it
[00:38:25] by saying, well, are you going to be ready in the same day when the house comes up on the market?
[00:38:28] Right? Because I'll want to get you in. How about you? Right? So I took that question and I turned it
[00:38:34] around on them. And it makes them feel like, okay, wow, yeah, like she is more concerned about me
[00:38:40] showing up than I am concerned about her showing up. Because I'm like properties are moving quickly,
[00:38:45] you know, when they come on the same day, like we got to go, whether I get you in or someone else
[00:38:49] gets you in, you got to see the home, right? So it's, it's kind of an interesting thing. So like,
[00:38:55] we've learned about that a little bit, right? So like take their worries and really turn it up
[00:39:00] on its head and like, maybe switch it on them. I've had, I've interviewed agents, top agents in the
[00:39:06] country who will literally say to a client and this takes some finessing and it's not something
[00:39:12] you would want to practice this a lot before you do it. And you guys probably do some version of
[00:39:17] this. But there's, I've talked to agents who will say, when we go to see something, the moment you think,
[00:39:24] I, this might be it, are you able to make a decision that day or the next day because if not,
[00:39:32] you are going to lose it. Depending on the situation, if they know for sure, like, there's no waiting
[00:39:37] on the scale, and I as the agent, I'm not doing you a service. If, if I don't know that you're ready
[00:39:43] to do this, because I'm just going to be spinning not only my own wheels, but I'm going to be wasting
[00:39:47] your time. And, and there's a way to sort of explain that that that's not super like aggressive,
[00:39:53] but is really sort of per to the point, which is I need a client that can make a decision because
[00:40:01] that's, I want to get you this, but whatever property. And there's a lot of competition out there.
[00:40:06] So I think, you know, that sort of speaks to what you were saying is, are you going to be available
[00:40:10] to do to do showings? When are you going to be available? Like, if I call you at 8 a.m,
[00:40:14] you know, can you get out of work at 1 p.m. to do this? And what days could you do it? And just sort
[00:40:20] of really understanding like what their level of commitment is. And then you're sort of working as a
[00:40:24] team and you both have these agreements with each other, where it's not that you're just
[00:40:29] placating them, but they're like, no, I work with the professional here. I got to, I got to,
[00:40:33] you know, level up as well as the client. And it's exciting and fun because then you're both
[00:40:39] kind of working as hard as you can together and holding each other accountable. And I think that
[00:40:45] makes it a little bit easier. I also want to go back to something you'd said about working,
[00:40:50] you know, you talked about why should I work with you? Having that as an objection and kind of
[00:40:55] going back to objections. And that's a really important one to be able to answer. And it's so easy
[00:40:59] to not practice answering that question if you work mostly by referral. Because if you work by
[00:41:05] referral, you probably don't have to answer that question very much because they're coming through
[00:41:09] another source that's like, oh my god, crystals, the best. You're going to want to work with her.
[00:41:13] They're probably not going to hit you with like, why you and not somebody else. They already know
[00:41:17] that you're like amazing. But it's easy to let that muscle atrophy a little bit and sort of realize,
[00:41:22] like, oh, yeah, there are going to, I'm going to meet people that don't know. I'm amazing. And
[00:41:26] maybe I need to be able to demonstrate that in a 22nd pitch. And I need to be able to give them
[00:41:32] some confidence that like, I know what I'm doing. And it's really easy to just not practice that.
[00:41:37] Because it's not the fun thing to practice. It's not fun to be to be put on the spot and go,
[00:41:41] why you and not somebody else? Like, I mean, at least it's not fun for me. I get that all the time,
[00:41:46] too. It's like, why should I join your firm and not the hundreds of other firms out there? And I'm
[00:41:49] like, that's a great question. Like, that is not an easy question to answer. But I got to practice
[00:41:54] that question, that answer as well. Because it's a totally valid question. And why should I work with
[00:42:00] you is totally valid. And yet, it's an easy one just not not to focus on and not practice.
[00:42:05] And so, yeah, not to have in your back pocket. And like, why? Like, what are your three
[00:42:09] why's they should work with you? You know, you don't have to keep going on and on. But I think
[00:42:13] it's some of it is like, obviously, a little bit of, you know, your accomplishments. And then,
[00:42:17] obviously, what you're going to do for them. Yeah. And so, you know, going, you said something
[00:42:24] about like knowing if the buyer is ready, right? And so, and, you know, that would be very
[00:42:30] blunt to say, Hey, you know, I want to know that if I'm going to work with you that you're going
[00:42:33] to be serious about ready, we would say, you know, Hey, you know, buyer burnout is really real.
[00:42:38] Have you heard of it? Yes. Like, you see 30 homes and like, you're done. So I want to make sure that
[00:42:43] if I'm taking you out that you're really fully ready, because I don't want you to get burned out.
[00:42:48] I don't want you to just give up on your hopes and dreams of being a homeowner or being an investor.
[00:42:53] So I want to make sure that when we're going out, it's the right time you're ready, the money's ready,
[00:42:57] and we're ready to go because I don't want you to get tired because it happens very quickly, right?
[00:43:01] And it's a real thing. So, so we, we definitely, you know, it's another way of delivering a word.
[00:43:06] It's like a little finesse and we're concerned about them. Which we are, right? Because for the both of us,
[00:43:12] like, no one wants to be that agent going out for the second year or showing a buyer home that you
[00:43:18] can't, you know, like it's, I remember I did it for I think almost three years once. I met a client
[00:43:23] like every other month and showed him a home for three years, you know, it's exhausting.
[00:43:28] Sometimes you have to do it, but other times some people are just looking, they don't know
[00:43:32] themselves, you know? So I think getting deep with them and understanding like that,
[00:43:37] the true motivation and like whether they do have to or they don't is going to tell you whether
[00:43:41] they're serious or not, you know? And learning the, the, the, the sort of methods of communicating this
[00:43:48] in an elegant way that's not aggressive in it's in it's respectful, but it's also firm and,
[00:43:54] and it's, you know, really, really direct. It is in a nice way. I think is one of the reasons why
[00:44:02] joining a team can be so helpful because you have people that have done this for a long time and
[00:44:07] they know how to answer these questions and they can drill, you know, the other people on the team
[00:44:12] who are newer. And then you also have tools that will drill you as well. And so again,
[00:44:17] there just aren't a lot of tools out there that do that quite frankly. And so I love that you have
[00:44:21] that. So by the way, if anyone is listening to this and thinking, gosh, this sounds pretty great.
[00:44:26] Like I would like to improve my lead gen. I'd like to do better on social. I'd like to do better
[00:44:32] with my skills. And you're like here in the Chicago land area and maybe you're on a team and maybe
[00:44:37] they're not giving you what you feel you deserve or maybe you're not on a team and you're not getting
[00:44:41] it from your brokerage. Like talk to Crystal, reach out to her. She doesn't take everybody. Of course,
[00:44:45] she doesn't take most people. But you know, think about what value you could bring to her and
[00:44:49] what you're looking for and connect with her. And I've sent people over to her. I love what I get a
[00:44:55] phone call from an agent who's looking for leads. And we just don't have that. And Crystal, of course,
[00:45:01] isn't going to just like, here's all the leads you need. Obviously, that's not how it works anywhere.
[00:45:05] But she does have lead sources for you. And if you are willing to be coached and do, you know,
[00:45:10] what she suggests and what the team suggests and follow, what has been proven to be very successful
[00:45:16] for them, just kind of do what's told of you and what's asked of you and like be a good team member.
[00:45:22] Like you will be successful. And so you should reach out to her. And she's incredibly approachable.
[00:45:27] And Crystal, so if you are somebody who's an agent here and you, you know, I should be
[00:45:32] for burning for my own company. But that is not my intention today. My intention is to celebrate
[00:45:37] you and and and we don't have a lot of the things that that you and your team have. And I think
[00:45:42] that's great. So I'm super excited to have our listeners, you know, reach out. And also too,
[00:45:48] if you're an agent in another state and Chicago is one of your feeder markets or it's one of the
[00:45:53] places people go to when they're maybe first in your market and they come here or they leave here
[00:45:58] and go there. She needs to connect with agents and those relationships as well. And the other thing
[00:46:03] too is rentals, right? Rentals are a lot of times for agents not in this area. You know,
[00:46:08] Chicago is a big hub for business. And so people come in, maybe they're only here a year or two,
[00:46:13] they're just going to be renting, they're going to maybe their company is going to pay for it. And
[00:46:16] these are people that spend five to 10 grand a month on or their company's pay for it. And they're
[00:46:22] getting a condo and it's an apartment that's very expensive. And they really need somebody that
[00:46:27] understands that luxury market and Crystal doesn't just work in luxury. But she certainly knows that
[00:46:32] world. You know, that's also a great reason to reach out to her because that's a really important
[00:46:37] thing. And people who are just doing leasing oftentimes their skill set isn't as developed as
[00:46:42] somebody who's a luxury brokerage brand like yours. And so, so that's another reason to reach out.
[00:46:48] And also too, for people that aren't doing rentals and rentals are tough. They're not easy. But
[00:46:53] what a great way to start a relationship with somebody who's almost certainly going to be buying in
[00:46:57] the future, right? So just or that might buy when they're actually thinking they're going to rent.
[00:47:01] Yeah, you might be able to switch them and say, hey, well, these rental prices, you know,
[00:47:06] they're so high. Well, this is what it looks like to buy or maybe, you know, if you're sick and
[00:47:09] tired of living in these apartment buildings that have thin walls and so many people and them,
[00:47:14] you're waiting for the elevator. Let's get into let's get you into something that feels like home.
[00:47:18] Right. I want to ask you what a couple last final questions about how what you tell your team
[00:47:26] to focus on. And I know again, there's a million things people can do and there's not one answer
[00:47:31] to this question. But, you know, if someone comes to you and they say, hey, I am struggling with
[00:47:36] lead generation, for example, and yes, you can help them with leads that your team has,
[00:47:40] then you can help distribute, but for their only generation, you know, what might you suggest
[00:47:44] as a way to help them sort of start improving that skill and getting more people in their database?
[00:47:52] You know, getting getting active on social. Yeah, reconnecting with people like friends from high
[00:47:59] school, old jobs, families, cousins, third cousins, well, whoever, you know, reconnecting with them
[00:48:05] and then obviously posting on social media because out of sight, out of mind, I think, you know,
[00:48:10] and social media just gives us, it makes it easier for us to have conversations. In fact,
[00:48:16] sometimes like we don't even start the conversation about our team or real estate. It's someone
[00:48:21] else mentioning, oh, hey, I see what you're doing on real estate. Oh, I, you know, so it just helps
[00:48:25] with that branding and marketing and spreading the message a lot faster where you don't always have
[00:48:30] to be the one to do the work, where if they are thinking about renting or buying or selling,
[00:48:35] they see a post and they'll say, oh, I should give Sam a call, right? He's really consistent,
[00:48:39] he's very professional, he's always showing up and he's got a lot of people that trust him because
[00:48:44] they like and come in on his post. Same thing on the other side too, right? Like I think the
[00:48:49] easiest ones are birthdays, anniversaries, selling anniversaries. And then from that layer is like
[00:48:55] getting into your contact list and just, you know, touching base with people, getting on their radar,
[00:49:02] asking them for the business, which is the most important part. Like everyone just assumes, oh,
[00:49:07] yeah, he liked my post, he likes every post that I put up there. He's going to call me when he's
[00:49:11] ready to sell him. It's like, that's not the case. If someone's liking your post, call them and say,
[00:49:16] hey, I see you liking everything. Thank you so much for the support for you guys. And like,
[00:49:21] I just wanted to reach out and just say, thank you. And you know, always appreciate you,
[00:49:25] like throwing those thumbs up, like what's going on in life, right? So, you know, that is such a great
[00:49:31] little mini tip that I don't think anyone has ever shared on the show before. And we have over 700
[00:49:39] episodes. You just gave a really great reason to pick up the phone. And, and we do appreciate when
[00:49:45] people put the like on or they comment on a post. And it isn't reason to reach out and to say,
[00:49:52] you know, hey, I posted this content, you seem to appreciate it. I just want to let you know,
[00:49:56] I appreciate that it was good that you liked it and that it was helpful to you. And I'd just
[00:50:01] love to learn more about what's going on with you right now. Like what's, and you could also look
[00:50:05] in their feed as well to see what's going on in their life. And see, I saw you just went on
[00:50:10] vacation or whatever. But it's a conversation starter. And I don't think anyone has ever in our
[00:50:15] history of episodes talked about calling people who like a post. I think that is brilliant.
[00:50:21] Yeah, it's like taking it all the way home, right? It's like you're posting something they're
[00:50:24] liking it and then you're going back to them and saying, hey, like you're on my radar. Like,
[00:50:29] let's talk what's going on. And anyone, I mean, it's just how referrals work, right? It's like,
[00:50:33] you see someone you run into in the grocery store and then a week later they're referring
[00:50:37] you somebody. It's because they saw you. And so there's just all these layers to it. But I think
[00:50:41] the most important one that we still struggle with till today is, you know, you get that buyer,
[00:50:47] you get clients you're running around with, you're showing them homes and they get burnt out,
[00:50:51] they stop. They're, they're, you know, lives change. And we just leave them in the dark. We don't
[00:50:57] ever reach back out and say, hey, you know, things got really hard last time. Where are they at? Like,
[00:51:02] I still remember that you wanted to buy this and do that. And I just want to know how,
[00:51:08] like, how can we help you? Right? And just by you having that conversation, whether they want to work
[00:51:13] with you or they might know someone else that wants to work with you. So I think picking up that
[00:51:17] ball, because everyone is always ready to like, oh, I got this newly. They want to go look at houses.
[00:51:21] Let's look at 30 houses. And then the buyer's like, um, don't really see anything. I like, so I'll
[00:51:27] just, I'll reach out to you. Don't call me. I'll reach out to you. And the agents are like, yeah,
[00:51:31] he said he's in a call me. And then all of a sudden, that guy posted a photo that he bought a
[00:51:35] condo with a different REALTOR, right? So it's like, we're not, we're going through and doing all
[00:51:39] that upfront work of educating, driving them around, you know, like telling them all about HWA's
[00:51:46] and finding out all these questions and answers and running all these comps. And it's like, we're
[00:51:50] doing all that work up front and like, literally not, not bringing it to the finish line.
[00:51:54] Well, and I always think, I always think too, like, you don't, the fortune is in the follow-up for sure.
[00:51:59] And just like we were saying earlier, easier for me to find a whole new list of people I haven't
[00:52:04] talked to and say, you should check out Kale Realty. We're so amazing. And instead of going back to
[00:52:09] the people I've already talked to and say, hey, let's, let's check in. Where are you out in the process?
[00:52:13] What, what are you, you know, and it's, it's for some reason, it's more fun for me to go to the new
[00:52:18] people. And I think that's like you were saying, it's easy to go to the new leads. And going back to
[00:52:23] those existing leads is really, really important. And if we think like, well, we're bothering those
[00:52:28] people, it's like, you're not. And here's the reason, here's how you know you're not. We have
[00:52:33] technology now that basically makes it that if they do not want to chat with you, they will not pick
[00:52:38] up the phone. They will watch the transcription of the voice mail you're leaving in real time now
[00:52:43] as it's being transcribed by our phones, literally reading it as you're saying it. They are, if they
[00:52:49] don't want to talk to you, it's not like you're going to catch them off guard and you're going to get
[00:52:53] them at a bad time. And they're going to be like, I'm in the middle of this and I can't really, like,
[00:52:56] that's just not going to happen anymore. So when you call them, if they don't answer, it doesn't
[00:53:01] mean they don't like you, of course, but like don't worry about it. Like just leave them in the message
[00:53:06] and can keep following up and they're going to appreciate that. I love people that are persistent.
[00:53:11] And quite frankly, I just don't answer the phone if I don't want to talk to somebody. It doesn't
[00:53:14] mean I don't like them. It just might be... Yeah, just timing. So I think that is such a great tip is
[00:53:22] just go back to the people that maybe even maybe you even drop the ball on and like that's okay
[00:53:28] too to even acknowledge, hey, you know, I feel like maybe I didn't give you enough attention
[00:53:33] a few months ago and I want to rebuild the relationship and maybe you say it in a different way.
[00:53:38] But there's a way to do that too and really show that like you want to do better and meet their
[00:53:44] needs. And I think that's also super helpful. And the other side of it, which is like a negative,
[00:53:49] is like you get a no from the client, right? Oh, I bought something, you know, oh, I'm not really,
[00:53:55] but that's great because you get them off your list then. You get them off your follow-up list.
[00:54:01] Yeah. You know, the agents that are like, oh, I don't want to send a mass email because they're
[00:54:04] going to unsubscribe. It's like, well, we want them to unsubscribe because if they don't want to
[00:54:07] get our information, then they got to go, right? So then you're really purposely working and
[00:54:12] calling and talking to people that actually want to work and talk to you. Right. You know, so it's
[00:54:16] good to get the notes, you know, so it's like, we have to look at it in a positive way and be like,
[00:54:20] okay, they don't want to work with me. They don't feel like I'm the right person for them.
[00:54:24] Totally fine. Get them off the list. I'll stop calling. Let me call some other people.
[00:54:28] Great. So it's not a bad thing. Yeah, it's not a bad thing.
[00:54:31] Yeah, I unsubscribe from every newsletter from any company. The moment I'm like, I just don't
[00:54:37] need the service right now any longer. And it's not like, I don't like you. It's just, I don't want
[00:54:43] that clogging on my inbox, but I know how it can feel to the person seeing the unsubscribe because
[00:54:48] we did those as well. And it's almost like you almost have to remember like, this is, this is,
[00:54:53] we don't have enough information to know if this is a real rejection or not. This could just be
[00:54:56] timing. They don't want you in your inbox. It almost doesn't matter. If you can just like,
[00:55:02] I, for me, I just don't even look at those. I don't want to see them because I get bummed out.
[00:55:07] And I just, it gets removed from my database. That person gets put in a, in a different
[00:55:10] category. We revisit it down the road. And then we figure out if we want to reengage that person
[00:55:15] or not. But like, yeah, there's things. There's reasons why, you know, you really want to protect,
[00:55:20] you know, your, if you put things come in and it doesn't make you feel good, it's like,
[00:55:25] figure out a way to like not see that. But also, you know, have a process to where that person is,
[00:55:31] is, you know, you're not worrying about that person any longer. I think this is really a great place
[00:55:37] for us to wrap up. I just kind of have one last question, which is, I think, you know, you talk
[00:55:41] about burnout with clients. And I also think agent burnout is also super, super real too. So, you know,
[00:55:48] again, I always think, I don't think balance is possible. I think balance is a myth. But we can get
[00:55:54] close to it. I mean, it's close to having a balanced work life, home life, and set boundaries
[00:55:59] in a healthy way and be, you know, not, you know, work too hard where we're burning out.
[00:56:06] Where, how do you help your agents sort of figure out that balance?
[00:56:11] Yeah, I think, you know, going back to burnout, it's really easy for someone on our team to
[00:56:14] burn out because after you're probably on the team for like two months, three months, you're
[00:56:20] probably getting access to anywhere from three to five buyer leads a day. Wow.
[00:56:26] Calls. So like, you're either picking up up or you're, these are live, these are live transfer
[00:56:31] phone calls. These are calls. They're not live transfer anymore because now it's like, it's
[00:56:36] connected with showing time because the loan showing time. And so they can request a time on the
[00:56:40] website. But they're still directly connected to a client. Yeah. And I think it's like at the
[00:56:45] beginning of the new age, you're like, oh, my God, opportunity. Yes, I'll take all of them. I'll
[00:56:49] take all of them. But really, in the long run, it's like, you shouldn't take all of them. You
[00:56:52] should actually pace yourself. And you should actually only take, you know, five a week, even though
[00:56:58] you have access to 25, don't take 20 or 15, take five. And it might not sound like a lot,
[00:57:05] but it will be a lot, especially if you have five to seven buyers, you're trying to juggle at
[00:57:10] the same time. And so getting back to that burnout is like going back to knowing when to say no
[00:57:15] or stop or pause and knowing yourself. Like, if you, if you feel yourself getting burned out,
[00:57:21] like, hey, take a personal day, get someone to cover your showings, your clients will understand,
[00:57:26] right? Like, I don't think I've ever lost a client because they're like, oh, my God,
[00:57:31] you had someone else cover the show, I can't believe that. Like, everyone knows that like,
[00:57:34] there's a lot of moving parts we're trying to accommodate everyone, especially the buyer schedule,
[00:57:39] seller schedule. And, and you just have to know yourself a little bit more and to know when
[00:57:44] you need those pauses in your calendar. So if it's like, hey, every quarter, I need to go on a
[00:57:49] vacation or just need to vegetate at home, do it, you know, like don't feel guilty. And,
[00:57:56] and I think people have to learn how to work smarter because like in real estate, you know,
[00:58:00] we think we're putting in a six hour day, but like two of it was like scrolling Instagram. And the
[00:58:05] other one was like, you know, puttin around and we call that work, but it's like, why don't we try
[00:58:10] to work smarter so that we can actually be more productive in a short time frame than to sit at
[00:58:15] something for such a long time and like, you know, give your whole day to it. So, so it's more
[00:58:22] about protecting your time, your time, your headspace, your energy. And I think this is where accountability
[00:58:27] and coaching comes in. And I think teams, if they're structured correctly, can provide that. They can
[00:58:34] not only provide sort of, you know, hey, I need help. I need to take a day and someone on the team
[00:58:40] help me, you know, cover some of my responsibilities. Yes. But then there's also like, hey, I've got this
[00:58:44] problem. I got this thing, the situation. I don't know what to do. The team can help solve that
[00:58:48] problem. And also, hey, I don't know how to answer this particular question around an objection
[00:58:54] that the team can say, hey, here's how I do it. And there's a camaraderie to all of this. And there's
[00:58:59] also a, hey, I need some help staying accountable. I need some help, you know, someone needs to call
[00:59:05] me at 4 p.m. and say, did you make your dials today? And, and the teams can help you. You know,
[00:59:11] again, none of these things are inherently something to feel bad about. They're just, you just have
[00:59:16] to buy a solution to it. And, you know, I, I joke that, and it's not even a joke, but it's something
[00:59:22] I'm not, it's a little embarrassing for me to say, but it works. Is I have somebody that calls me
[00:59:27] every morning at 6 a.m. to make sure I'm awake. And I'm 49 years old. I'd like to say that I don't
[00:59:33] need that because there's alarms. And I have all sorts of other technology to wake me up. And yet,
[00:59:37] I have somebody who calls me at 6 a.m. to make sure. And so what I do is I set my alarm for 555.
[00:59:43] So that the person doesn't have to call me and I message them at 5 p.m. I'd say, I'm good,
[00:59:46] I'm good. You don't have to call me. But it's a little bit something that I kind of like wish I
[00:59:51] didn't have to have that, but I do have it. It's accountability and it works. And guess what? I wake up.
[00:59:56] So it almost doesn't matter like what you need. You just need people that can help solve problems
[01:00:02] for you. And you can't solve all the problems yourself. And so teams like crystals is really great
[01:00:07] for just helping help me solve problems. You know, whether it's I need more leads, I need to
[01:00:11] generate my own leads. I need more accountability. I need to increase my skills. You know, crystal
[01:00:16] inner team, this is what they do. And if you are somebody that comes in with heroes, my challenges,
[01:00:23] you know, might be a good fit for crystal inner team because they might have solutions for you.
[01:00:26] They are very solutions focused. And they're also just super nice people. So if you are an agent
[01:00:31] in the Chicago and area and you're looking to maybe join a team or explore what other teams have
[01:00:36] to offer, reach out to crystal crystal, tan, cran crystal, tran team is where you find her on

[01:00:57] professional that she is. And she's a real help to our show. And these are the exact kind of agents

Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.

So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io and now onto the show. Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide. I'm your host through the show in just a moment. We're going to be speaking with top producer, Crystal Tran, one of my favorite people. She is amazing. You are going to love this conversation. Before we get to Crystal, just a quick reminder, the best way you can help us is by leaving us a review. Tell us what you think of the show, wherever you're listening to us, Spotify, Apple Podcast, wherever. Leave us a review and let us know. And we will always try to improve our show to meet your needs. And also tell a friend, think of one of the REALTOR that could benefit from hearing these great conversations with top producers. Maybe a new REALTOR. Somebody you know is getting in the business, who needs a little step up in the right direction. And they need to hear what Crystal today is going to tell them. Shoot them a link over to our show. We appreciate it. And thank you to everyone for either being new listeners or returning listeners. We love you. And let's get right to it. My conversation with Crystal Tran. All right, tell me the best piece of advice you've received to real estate. Put your name on everything. Make it a brand and make it a logo. That's the best advice. You know, and I've curated all the way through. And it's really held me. It's still paying off, you know, to this day. So it's one of the first things I've ever established. And one of the best advices ever was like brand and market yourself your name and keep it consistent. Yeah, don't be a secret REALTOR. Don't be a secret REALTOR. Don't have different identities with all these different logos that keep changing be consistent. Yeah, I love that. And worst piece of advice you ever received. And worst piece of advice was you can only pick up clients through your sphere. And it is so natural because my whole team wouldn't exist if that was the case. So we probably work with, I would say, 80% of the buyers we work with are complete strangers. Wow. Yeah, sellers, you know, it's probably a little bit less. But it's definitely a big portion of our business where clients are finding us online or through AI, which is pretty cool. We get that feedback. We've gotten that a few times. So really exciting stuff ahead. I love that too because a lot of times people think the only way is through the network. And of course, for a lot of agents, that does kind of be their main source. And a lot of the people we have on the show that is how they grow. But it's not even as common as most of the people that we have on the show. Like a lot of them are that way, but a lot of them aren't. They have other lead sources. They're constantly getting people that do not know them into their sphere. And so we'll maybe we'll talk about a bit about how you do that today because a lot of times people listen to our show and they go, I don't have a big network. And maybe I just moved here or I just not really comfortable talking to my friends a lot about this. And so we can talk about how you guys get that. But my guest today is a returning guest to our show. She is a friend of mine and one of the top agents here in Chicago. I'm really honored to be her friend. I think she is just one of those lovely positive forces of this industry. She's a good person. And she has a wonderful team. And she actually just helped my girlfriends, fiancees. Now mom actually find a place. So that's how much I like her. And that's how great she is. And her name is Crystal Tran. She is with at properties Christie's International here in the Chicago land area. She has the Crystal Tran team. And they are a powerhouse and just some of the nicest people in this business. Well, I'll tell you more about Crystal. Born and raised here in Chicago. And she earned her Bachelor of Arts in Business and Marketing from Eastern Illinois. And she's a self-taught marketer. She's a website designer app developer. We can talk about that too. She's the creator of Agent Duty, which is her app. It's a productivity tool designed to help real estate agents work smarter and streamline their date-to-day operations. She leads the Crystal Tran team, which is the powerhouse team of over 20 top producing agents ranked among at properties top 50 teams. Our team holds the number four spot here in the gold coast, here in the Chicago. And is recognized by real trends verified as the number two large team in Illinois by side sold last year, 2024. She's known for innovation, tech-driven marketing strategies, and that really just get results. That she's a certified negotiation expert and luxury collection specialist. She pairs sharp marketing insight with mentorship, helping her team grow into confident, high-performing professionals. And when she's not closing deals or coaching her agents, Crystal is dedicating to supporting nonprofit initiatives across Chicago and the North Shore, passion for real estate leadership and innovation. Power is a business built on service, results, and impact. Follow her on Instagram. She has great Instagram account, Crystal Tran team, and that's C-R-Y-S-T-A-L-T-R-N team. And we'll have a link to that for her Instagram. And also find her website, which is crystaltranteam.com as well. And you can really learn about their mission and their values and how they treat agents. And also their branding. I think their branding is really special and very intentional and very specific and very clean. And I just, I like it aesthetically. I like it. So Crystal, welcome back to the show. Thank you so much, DJ. So excited to always get on a call with you and chit chat about what's happening in the real estate space. I love it. We had to postpone our last one because we mistakenly scheduled it while I was on this vacation. And I was in the process of getting engaged. And so I miscommunicated that to my, my, my, my booker. And she, we had to reschedule and we had to explain why. And you sent a very nice note. So thank you for, for wishing me well ahead of the, that's so cool. I like it was just cool. I had this inside information like not too many people know that you're going to propose. And I was so privileged to feel like I was one of the first to know. So I was just waiting for the announcement. Yeah, yeah. And so now we just have all only about a million more things to do to get ready for it. But but we're almost there. I was telling Crystal ahead of time we got lucky and got a lot of things pre pre planned, which just kind of worked out. And so we did the things a little bit out of order, not by choice, but it worked out that way. And the proposal was actually about the last thing that we had to do. But it worked out really well. And now we can tell everybody and say, oh, by the way, we have all this stuff planned and, and, you know, you can just kind of cruise into it next year. So anyway, let's talk about you. So I want to hear about, you know, maybe we've been on our show before, but, you know, we gosh, probably hundreds of episodes ago. Is when you first came on and certainly we get new, new people listening every, every, every episode. We have brand new, a listener. So I want to hear a little bit about your story. Like tell us because you didn't start on a team or you didn't start as a, as a Crystal Tran team. But tell us how you, how you got into real estate and sort of how you grew and, and how you built your own team. Yeah. So I think in 2012, I was living out in LA and I decided to get licensed out in California, worked for a top producer for RE/MAX and really helped him handle his short sale files. So that was, you know, bottom of the market, 2012, 2013. So my first experience was it, was a California agent. And it's definitely, you know, when you're short, short-sailing, really nice, beautiful homes. It's definitely, it's fun experience, though, you know, with this extra layer of, of the market that I was really happy that I had the opportunity to learn right away, you know, because there's some agents that get into this industry and they never know what a down market is. They only know up. So I started in the down market. And so I decided that LA wasn't for me and I returned back home and went back to the block that I knew, which was in downtown Winakka. I had worked on that block for a very long time as a hairstylist at a place called Sizzar's Edge Slon that's still there today. I spent about 13 years there. And, you know, just I loved, you know, the creativity of being a stylist and working with people and having clients that concept of being able to build these relationships is cool. So real estate was just like an instant kind of pool for me. So I started out at Cannington Stray in the Winakka office, which was fun fact, the office that was in the Ferris Bueller's Ferris Bueller. Oh, Gene Bueller. That was that. That's funny. Yeah. So now, now they've closed that office. So I've been, you know, probably like two, three years ago, you know, moved over to Atts. So I was really at Cannington Stray, a Berkshire Hathaway Canning Rubeloff for a good 10 years of my career. And that's really like, I think after year five, my sister had reached out to me and she said, Hey, my friend Natasha, she's getting licensed, you know, she just wants to kind of assist and get involved a little bit. Would you be open to letting her shadow you? So I brought Natasha on. Kassam, Natasha, Kassam on as my assistant. And she got licensed and then all of a sudden I was like, well, we're a team now. So the team got developed kind of accidentally and and and then probably a year later, my friend Selma, who I had known probably since I was 18 reached out and said, Hey, I really resonate with your brand, what you're doing, you know, and I want to be a part of of your team. Would you bring me on and coach me? And so she was my second hire. Those two are still with me until today eight years later. And so, you know, when I became like when I when I started my team, I wasn't like this crazy top producer. I didn't have huge amounts of, you know, leads coming in and clientele. I just was willing to show them what I had known and they were starting to develop their own business. And so, you know, with them helping me and giving me more time to work on the brand, build the social media, build the marketing because it takes a lot of time, you know. So, so really that's how we got started was like by accident. And now we're a team of I believe we're about 22, 22 agents right now. Yeah. Wow. And still growing. Still growing. Yes. Very much still growing. We really, I mean, our goal, I think by the end of 2026 is to be a team of 30 if not more. So we feel very confident in, you know, the pace that we're moving at, even with 20, 22 agents right now, you know, everyone's not fully involved, but it's manageable. I have an ops manager where everyone's feeling attended to we have systems in place and, you know, there's there's a lot of great positive points on why somebody would join our team, you know, then, then to be a solo agent. I have had agents who have started out solo and joined our team, agents have who have come from other teams or agents that have done it for a long time on their own and just have said, I like, I've had enough. I can't do this anymore. The one-man show is really hard. And it's hard to constantly remodivate yourself all the time. Yes. I play. Boy, that is, that is not, that is such a, such a truth because you do have to wear every hat and you just aren't going to be good at everything, right? Like the skills are just too different, right? So there's, there's the skills of interpersonal skills of, you know, working with clients and meeting their needs and being emotionally meeting their needs and being really good at the job and then doing all of the, all the sort of operational stuff when it comes to numbers and metrics and, and, and understanding, you know, just how the job works and, and also just all the compliance and it, it's just so many different skills that people aren't going to be skilled in all of that. And it's certainly tough to be a solo agent, I think, these days. And, and then solo agents are competing with, with teams. And I think that's tough too because teams have kind of figured out their strength and numbers and your team is, is a, is it an example of that? And you do something very unique. Well, actually, before we talk about your team, I want to talk about your brand and then I want to get to your team because I always, we'll forget to talk about this on the show is your brand person. Tell me what, when you think of your brand, what comes to mind? Like what are the, what are the characteristics of your brand that you sort of want your clients to think about when they, when they think about you? Professional. That's definitely number one. Systematic. It's something about, you know, it's, it's, the logo is very crisp, clean, but has like a creative side to it, right? With some color, a little cursive, but for the most part, it's very balanced. A lot of harmony to it, right? Because that is, you know, it really just embodies us overall, like the professionalism, you know, how systematic we are and, and bringing that harmony to a sale, right? Because it's like, it kind of have to be all these different moving parts, right? You've got to be authoritative to, you know, a client when they're not listening to you or not really understanding the market, but then you have to be the tough guy when it comes to negotiating and then you've got to be the soft one when, you know, it's something a little bit more of a touchy reason and why they're selling, you know, whether there's a divorce or a family death, you know, then you've really got to embody all these parts, but I really think that, you know, our logo is like very a strategic look and people instantly recognize it and they'll just say, oh yeah, I, and, you know, the hard part is I always have this marketing friend who's always trying to get me to change my logo. He's like, you got to modernize it and I just like, I'm having a hard time letting go of it, you know, because I, to me, I think it's great, but, um, I, yeah, I, I don't think I want to change it anytime soon, but I totally get, you know, all this modernization of, you know, you always have to evolve in this industry and it's the same thing with brands and logos too, right? A reborn of your, of your brand, a reborn of, you know, maybe that look has changed now. Maybe we're a little bit more edgy. Maybe we service a different kind of clientele, you know, but I would say our brand really exemplifies like luxury is when you say that. Yeah, yeah, luxury for sure. And I also think there's some, I don't know, it comes across in knowing you personally and your team personally is there's, and I think this comes through in the, in the aesthetic is there's a kindness to your team. I think that goes a long way and is really, not talked about enough, I think, in this business where kindness and compassion and being just a nice good person goes a really long way and allows for you to, for agents to be a bit imperfect, right? If you're, if you're make mistakes, which we all do, if you're also like a really nice good person, the clients usually are pretty forgiving, but I think like you're just a solid nice person and your team's very sweet and nice and, and I, and they're also very aggressive and very, you know, intentional and, and they're very professional. I think that, that kindness and compassion that really goes a long way and, and people, when they think about your brand, I think there's a smile that maybe people have about it and I think that isn't maybe everybody's brand and, and I think that probably serves, serves you well. I agree. Yeah, I could tell you agree with that because it's like there's some agents out there that will never smile on their profile photo and when you meet them, they don't smile and there's no like, there's no brightness to them, they're not shiny, they're very dark, they're very dull, they're very, you know, and for us, it's like the reason why, you know, we're just not nice to be nice, but we just, we're really like, we really want to understand what's going on, you know, like, what's going on in their lives and a lot of the times, like, there's something bigger going on than just making a move. And if you want someone to open up to you, you really have to be, you know, just, you have to be inviting, you have to be a warm smile, like, if people don't get a chance to open up to you, then you really don't get to the bottom of what's driving the sale. Yeah. Because a lot of the times, you know, when we're buying and selling, it's, it's very emotional. So it allows us to connect with our clients a lot more and it really helps us, you know, fine tune the process of, hey, where do we need to be a little bit more sensitive? Where do we, you know, who do we, who needs to be involved? But I think when we stay focused on that, it really takes us through the transaction and makes the service, you know, really top tier service because we're not worried about the commission, we're not worried about, you know, are they, are they going to be pre-approved for this or that we're worried about what's happening in their lives? Yeah. And, and we're able to connect with them a lot more and then it really doesn't seem transactional, you know, and that's when we're winning and the client is winning, as long as the client is winning, we're winning. So it really helps. Yeah, and there's, there's people that come through, we always think about, you know, home buyers that are choosing to buy, but then there's people who going through divorce or people that are going through a death and they have to move. There's something that's forcing them to make this transaction and it might not be something they necessarily are super thrilled to be going through while they're doing this very difficult task of buying or selling a property. And so I think you're right, like there's that sensitivity of like, hey, the agents that are the clients that we have that are, you know, going through a tougher life moment, like we can still be there and and give them, you know, an extra layer of attention or, or, you know, sort of kindness that really will help them. And then those people are become so grateful, I think, the people that are having a hard time going through this with a team that really is kind to them with their circumstance so that they're going to tell everybody about you, right? Like I was going through a rough patch. I had to do this thing and the, you know, the Crystal Tran team like really helped me through that. And certainly the, you know, the people that are the estate planning attorneys, the divorce attorneys, you know, the ones who have to deal with with these sort of situations and refer agents, you know, they love agents like you or your team because you guys are really kind and compassionate. So anyway, but let's, yeah, let's talk about your team because I think in addition to your brand, I think what you actually offer your team is quite compelling and there aren't a lot of teams that are able to offer what you offer. And I think there's something very special about, you know, the what attracts agents to your team. And, yes, you're going to teach somebody how to build their business organically. Of course, that's a huge part of your business. But you said it earlier that 80% of the business really is is coming from other sources. And so you have what again, to me is such an attractive compelling answer to an agent that maybe their strong suit isn't getting out there and doing lead generation or reaching out to people and meeting people like maybe they're more introverted or maybe they're just like it's just not what they're good at. They're good at running the numbers or doing other things in the business. And you know, you have to just get out and meet a lot of people. And you've sort of helped solve for that for agents that are either newer or not newer. And necessarily, you said you have agents that have been doing this a long time would join your team and really are looking for some other lead opportunities. And you sort of have that. And I think, you know, that's something I'd love to talk about. So talk to us about sort of, you know, what you provide for your team that is unique. Well, I mean, every year we're constantly leveling up. So I would say our systems are pretty, you know, we're pretty, we're pretty like heavily text-stacked right now. So if an agent coming in, they're getting access to follow-up boss, which is an amazing platform. As you know, it really does, it's a very dynamic system. So it does a lot. We have YLOPO, which is like a force registration website that the agents can appear on every single listing page. So if they you know want to market a property, then if someone clicks on the link, then they could see the agent on that page rather than somebody else. So each agent has their own custom, you know, website. We have Maverick, which is a really cool tool. It's one of a new platform that we're kind of, it's integrated into follow-up boss, but it allows, it's an AI system that allows your team to practice, do practice calls, right? Yeah. Getting the rejection, getting the the mad seller, getting the disconcerned buyer, how to, you know, give your pitch and get feedback and give some feedback about where they can make some improvements and, you know, maybe using some, using, you know, rephrasing sentences for that. Instead of saying this, try saying this, right? And so with that, you're getting a lot of guidance. Because I think when you start as a REALTOR, you're getting so many things thrown at you. And it's almost impossible to stay on top of like what's really important, what's really going to move the noodle, noodle needle. You see where my head is at. But it's just a lot going at you. And you're kind of like your own CEO going, well, hey, you're building a business today. What do you want to build it out of sticks, paper, you know? And it's like, you get all these options and like you just don't know, you could go down like this long road of something where you're just like fully invested. And then a year later come to find out it wasn't a good investment. It wasn't a great way to invest your time. So like we have systems, you know, very well put systems in place and training to help the agents stay focused on what they should stay focused on, which is really growing their brand and marketing. And I know it just, when people say marketing, it just sounds like this one word that is such a blanket of everything. But like marketing just encompasses so many things, you know, visually how people perceive you in person, your marketing brochures, your online presence, you know, your headshot, your bios. There's just so much, are you posting videos? Are you using, you know, very like, are using Chatchee BT? It's part of it, right? Because that's really moving the needle now. So, so we just have all these systems in place and we really have them on like the right track. Because sometimes, they'll come in, they'll spend their wheels for like six hours a day going, oh, I had such a busy day. And I'm like, okay, well, what'd you do? Well, well, that didn't make you any money and that's really, you know, not a good, you know, time, you a good, a good use of your time, right? So let's let's refocus you on what's really important. And like even though it might be hair pulling, just know that if you get this done, it's going to help move the needle for you and that you're not wasting time in other places and doing, you know, having lunches with 30 lenders a year, right? That's, that's not helping you, right? So your time is, so we're teaching them a lot about those things, right? Like time management, the CRMs and really getting them prepped to the point where we feel comfortable with giving them lead flow. So we have two kinds of, you know, a few different kinds of lead flow. We'll have renter luxury leasing lead flow. We'll have buyers and we have sellers. The most ones we have are probably the buyers and renters. But, you know, this year was a very challenging year with rentals. It, the highest prices we've seen in a very long time in Chicago for rentals. And so, you know, I think there's that bent up demand from people either renewing their lease and they don't want to move because they don't, you know, they, they maybe thought they wanted to buy, but the rates are too high. So they're staying put. But, you know, going back around to the agent, it's like we're giving them all the tools and only the ones that they should use in their toolbox. We should, we should mention, I'm sorry to interrupt, I was going to say, we should mention that a lot of the tools you mentioned are tools you provide. You know, these are tools that you pay for for your team. They're not necessarily provided by your brokerage. Who, by the way, is one of the very best brokerages. If not the very best, you know, perceived brokerage brand here in Chicago who has unbelievable tools of their own. And yet, you've gone out and purchased additional tools. And, you know, when I think about the tools you mentioned, and I know the prices of those tools, and they are very expensive. And so, you know, another reason to consider joining a team in addition to all the coaching and the training and they're going to help you sort of figure out what to do every day is just getting access to some of these tools. Because, you know, we have a great tool set here at our company as well. I mean, we really do. And very few of our agents really take advantage of it, you know, and we think it's great. And the agents, some of them use it and a lot of them don't. And, you know, you're a team that you guys are boots on the ground like you're out there practicing your team's practicing. You know what works. And so, you're like, well, you know, the company has all these great tools, but we're going to give you this other suite of tools that we know is really un unbelievably effective. And I think that's also something that is kind of unique that you provide is these additional resources that, you know, maybe their firm already has a bunch of tools, but they don't use them or maybe they're not very good. And then you're able to bring in this additional suite. Yeah. Now, it's definitely been a game changer for us and has positioned us in a way that we have so much more to offer the agent, you know, even more stuff to offer the agent, which is exciting. And it really gives me like as, as, you know, being able to get like an bird's eye view of what's happening with the team. How many clients are we working with? How many how many leads are coming in? Who's talking to who who's on leader board? You know, are the agents putting in more calls this week? Are they not right? Because before I had I had no idea. I'd give someone a lead. I'd pray for them and say, hope you get it closed. Let me know when it closes. Now I could actually follow up and I could say, hey, you know, I've given you five of these leads. What's going on with them? I see that you haven't followed up, right? So there's a little bit more accountability on the team. And for someone that has a lot of lead flows because we have buyer and seller leads from like, we have a Zillow flex team. So that's obviously our biggest lead flow. And then we have Hunt Chicago, which is the primary website. Crystal Tran team is our Y-Lopo website. So two different kind of websites. Hunt Chicago, you would probably find through like an organic search. Crystal Tran team is something that you would probably find on our Instagram page or if we're marketing a property, we generally push that website out because it's forced registration. So it's Hunt Chicago, but I think the Crystal Tran team website has a better IDX. So it's much more user friendly. It's and it really has like this guided forced registration where it's kind of fun for buyers. Like it's already like predetermined like four answers, you know, like when are you looking to move one month, two month, you know, three months to six months and they just like going through there and just clicking, clicking, clicking. And so we have agents who are, you know, pulling in a lot of social media leads into Crystal Tran team and then getting that forced registration. And in that forced registration, we're getting so much information about them, whether they need to sell before they buy, whether they've been pre-approved, are they working with an agent, you know, and it's just nice to have all this data on people. And same thing with follow up bosses like when it's tied to Zillow now, I mean 85% of the people search on Zillow. So we actually could see their activity and it's just nice. Like wow, hey, I could call John and say, hey John, I just saw you started looking at dislains. Like what's going on there? We've been looking in Lakeview. Are you thinking about making a switch to the burps, right? So it gives us, it allows us to follow up with a client with more intent. So it just, you know, back in the day, it was like when I started, it was just kind of like this big question mark, you know, you were like praying, okay, I'm going to send out this post-credit parade. I'm going to, you know, like call my friends and pray so someone's going to reach out to me. Whereas like with follow up bosses, a lot more intention of like, hey, we know that they're looking. We know that they've saved properties or shared a link with their friend, right? Which is usually a good sign. They share a link. It's like, oh, okay, well, they're really interested. So, you know, and like with, I mean, app properties is amazing. Don't get me wrong. The reason why I went to app properties is because they have, you know, the app properties brand is amazing. Then they, you know, combined with Christie's, which made it like a no brainer for me, which had the international presence. But they just don't have the CRM that we have. They don't have like app properties. You get a landing page for a website. But, you know, if someone goes and searches on there, they might not necessarily come back to me. Right. They might go back to an app properties portal where they might give it to the listening agent. Or so it's it. I mean, I get a few leads from app properties like the website because maybe someone has like vetted us through Zillow and then went through app properties to make contact with us. Right. So, so all of the, I mean, they all matter. Don't get me wrong. They really do all matter. But we're just working in a way that's so different than like the rest of the company, which feels kind of cool because not that we want to be different, but because, you know, like things are always changing very quickly in tech and in teams in real estate. As we know, and it's like we have to stand top of it, right. And it's like what are the latest greatest tools that are going to help make our lives easier? Yeah. And brokerages oftentimes big, big brands like like app properties, they have multi-year relationships with certain tools and it's they're not easily able to net to say we're going to drop this one in switch to another one. And also half their agents would would freak out because they don't have to learn a new system. And so you're able to, it's kind of like the battleship and the bathtub. It's harder to navigate quickly. I'm there. The tool sets great. But when something better comes along, it's not super easy for them to just swap out a one into another. They've got a lot invested in this existing tool, whereas you can swap it in out of things much more easily and you can stay a little bit ahead of the curve there. And, you know, brokerages, you know, we have a brokerage. I know how hard it is for us to switch tools. And we just don't ever want to as a brokerage because it's a huge nightmare. And so, you want to just pick the right one. But of course, the right one doesn't stay the right one forever. And so you're have this ability to kind of swap it in out. And I wanted to mention one of the tools you you mentioned, which is really about skill building. And I think this is a really big, unique value that you provide because, you know, I was thinking about this just today because I recruit agents and that's my my job. And what I do is it's like really simple. If I want to like increase my the number of people I recruit every year, I've kind of like two options. I can increase the number of people I talk to and or I can increase my skill. And when I talk to those people, right? So if I don't increase my skill and I just double the number of people I talk to, I'll probably double the number of people I recruit, but I have to double the number of people I talk to. And that's tough. If I can work on my skill of recruiting and like what, you know, keep figuring out what people really need in a brokerage, how to communicate that and, and, you know, get more effective that way, then maybe I don't have to meet twice as many people. My close ratio would just go up and the easy thing to do is to meet new people. That's actually easier than building my skill for me because there's 46,000 REALTORS here in Chicago. I can always meet a new agent. I'm sorry, I can always meet somebody who I've never met before. And it's easy to meet new agents are, again, I keep saying new. I don't mean new to the business, necessarily, but just new to me. And it's so easy to find that. I can, I, you know, I have all the agents here and it's not easy to increase my skill. And you're taught, you help people do both, but you also help them build their skill. And that is really, really important. You know, it's something that I think many REALTORS overlook is how do I keep increasing? How do I keep doing those push-ups to get stronger? It's certainly easy to keep posting on social media, creating content, calling your existing clients, and all of that is really important. And then there's this other piece that's like maybe that's not as much fun, and it hurts a little bit more. And it's just not as like a sexy, but this, I'm going to work on the skill. And I'm just going to like get hit with these objections and figure out a better way to do it. And, hey, I can help you do that. You've got other tools to help you do that. Can you talk a little bit about that skill building and why it's so important? Well, the skill building tool is called Maverick, and it's an extension into follow-up boss, but, you know, overcoming objections is the biggest issue that we all have. We usually, you know, first objection, we're dead in the water, it's done, it's over, okay, have a good life, a move on, right? And so, you know, that's one level of it, right? It's, you know, getting the agents more confident about getting rejected by an AI machine and learning that, and then not being so shocked by it when it happens the first time or not knowing how to respond. And then the other side of it is like pitching your business. Well, why should I work with you? You know, what is your system? What do you do? What do you know, walk me through the process? What, and then get to the fee? How do you present the fee, you know, without getting pushback? And so, we're kind of dealing with a lot of those things, right? Whether it's the percentage or they don't assign for a year, you know, and it's challenging because like the Zillow Flex leads, they don't know who we are. Like these people that don't know who we are now, we have to say the year agreement, well, it's definitely a lot easier now that we have the reputation. Because like, once you build the marketing, that's when you start to build the reputation. And now because we have such a very long standing reputation, it's a lot easier for us to build a trust with the clients. So, you know, other things you have to learn is like learning how to say no. You know, that's something we coach on. It's like once we get through, you know, just like if you don't improve your skill set, then you're kind of constantly getting the same result. And if you're not relating to people, then you've got to switch how, you know, you have to change up how you're delivering that message. Like, do you have an agent? Oh, has anyone been helping you with your home search? I mean, those two basically say the same thing, but it like one is much softer and inviting, whereas the other one is just like, whoa, okay, well, back up, you know, I would be, I wouldn't like that question. It would make me put my guard up. So it really is, it's like the finesse of like tango dancing with the client, right? You want to be push a little bit to get a reaction out of them, see what they have to say, what their curiosity is. And then rebuttal in a way that's going to actually make them happy. So my one, like, I have a trick that I like to do is if somebody comes in an appointment and they're like, well, well, when are you going to, are you going to be available to show me these homes? Well, and I'll say, well, yeah, definitely, it's really our priority. Like, if a new home pops up in the market, you know, I'll want you to get in the same day. So I took their worry and then amplified it by saying, well, are you going to be ready in the same day when the house comes up on the market? Right? Because I'll want to get you in. How about you? Right? So I took that question and I turned it around on them. And it makes them feel like, okay, wow, yeah, like she is more concerned about me showing up than I am concerned about her showing up. Because I'm like properties are moving quickly, you know, when they come on the same day, like we got to go, whether I get you in or someone else gets you in, you got to see the home, right? So it's, it's kind of an interesting thing. So like, we've learned about that a little bit, right? So like take their worries and really turn it up on its head and like, maybe switch it on them. I've had, I've interviewed agents, top agents in the country who will literally say to a client and this takes some finessing and it's not something you would want to practice this a lot before you do it. And you guys probably do some version of this. But there's, I've talked to agents who will say, when we go to see something, the moment you think, I, this might be it, are you able to make a decision that day or the next day because if not, you are going to lose it. Depending on the situation, if they know for sure, like, there's no waiting on the scale, and I as the agent, I'm not doing you a service. If, if I don't know that you're ready to do this, because I'm just going to be spinning not only my own wheels, but I'm going to be wasting your time. And, and there's a way to sort of explain that that that's not super like aggressive, but is really sort of per to the point, which is I need a client that can make a decision because that's, I want to get you this, but whatever property. And there's a lot of competition out there. So I think, you know, that sort of speaks to what you were saying is, are you going to be available to do to do showings? When are you going to be available? Like, if I call you at 8 a.m, you know, can you get out of work at 1 p.m. to do this? And what days could you do it? And just sort of really understanding like what their level of commitment is. And then you're sort of working as a team and you both have these agreements with each other, where it's not that you're just placating them, but they're like, no, I work with the professional here. I got to, I got to, you know, level up as well as the client. And it's exciting and fun because then you're both kind of working as hard as you can together and holding each other accountable. And I think that makes it a little bit easier. I also want to go back to something you'd said about working, you know, you talked about why should I work with you? Having that as an objection and kind of going back to objections. And that's a really important one to be able to answer. And it's so easy to not practice answering that question if you work mostly by referral. Because if you work by referral, you probably don't have to answer that question very much because they're coming through another source that's like, oh my god, crystals, the best. You're going to want to work with her. They're probably not going to hit you with like, why you and not somebody else. They already know that you're like amazing. But it's easy to let that muscle atrophy a little bit and sort of realize, like, oh, yeah, there are going to, I'm going to meet people that don't know. I'm amazing. And maybe I need to be able to demonstrate that in a 22nd pitch. And I need to be able to give them some confidence that like, I know what I'm doing. And it's really easy to just not practice that. Because it's not the fun thing to practice. It's not fun to be to be put on the spot and go, why you and not somebody else? Like, I mean, at least it's not fun for me. I get that all the time, too. It's like, why should I join your firm and not the hundreds of other firms out there? And I'm like, that's a great question. Like, that is not an easy question to answer. But I got to practice that question, that answer as well. Because it's a totally valid question. And why should I work with you is totally valid. And yet, it's an easy one just not not to focus on and not practice. And so, yeah, not to have in your back pocket. And like, why? Like, what are your three why's they should work with you? You know, you don't have to keep going on and on. But I think it's some of it is like, obviously, a little bit of, you know, your accomplishments. And then, obviously, what you're going to do for them. Yeah. And so, you know, going, you said something about like knowing if the buyer is ready, right? And so, and, you know, that would be very blunt to say, Hey, you know, I want to know that if I'm going to work with you that you're going to be serious about ready, we would say, you know, Hey, you know, buyer burnout is really real. Have you heard of it? Yes. Like, you see 30 homes and like, you're done. So I want to make sure that if I'm taking you out that you're really fully ready, because I don't want you to get burned out. I don't want you to just give up on your hopes and dreams of being a homeowner or being an investor. So I want to make sure that when we're going out, it's the right time you're ready, the money's ready, and we're ready to go because I don't want you to get tired because it happens very quickly, right? And it's a real thing. So, so we, we definitely, you know, it's another way of delivering a word. It's like a little finesse and we're concerned about them. Which we are, right? Because for the both of us, like, no one wants to be that agent going out for the second year or showing a buyer home that you can't, you know, like it's, I remember I did it for I think almost three years once. I met a client like every other month and showed him a home for three years, you know, it's exhausting. Sometimes you have to do it, but other times some people are just looking, they don't know themselves, you know? So I think getting deep with them and understanding like that, the true motivation and like whether they do have to or they don't is going to tell you whether they're serious or not, you know? And learning the, the, the, the sort of methods of communicating this in an elegant way that's not aggressive in it's in it's respectful, but it's also firm and, and it's, you know, really, really direct. It is in a nice way. I think is one of the reasons why joining a team can be so helpful because you have people that have done this for a long time and they know how to answer these questions and they can drill, you know, the other people on the team who are newer. And then you also have tools that will drill you as well. And so again, there just aren't a lot of tools out there that do that quite frankly. And so I love that you have that. So by the way, if anyone is listening to this and thinking, gosh, this sounds pretty great. Like I would like to improve my lead gen. I'd like to do better on social. I'd like to do better with my skills. And you're like here in the Chicago land area and maybe you're on a team and maybe they're not giving you what you feel you deserve or maybe you're not on a team and you're not getting it from your brokerage. Like talk to Crystal, reach out to her. She doesn't take everybody. Of course, she doesn't take most people. But you know, think about what value you could bring to her and what you're looking for and connect with her. And I've sent people over to her. I love what I get a phone call from an agent who's looking for leads. And we just don't have that. And Crystal, of course, isn't going to just like, here's all the leads you need. Obviously, that's not how it works anywhere. But she does have lead sources for you. And if you are willing to be coached and do, you know, what she suggests and what the team suggests and follow, what has been proven to be very successful for them, just kind of do what's told of you and what's asked of you and like be a good team member. Like you will be successful. And so you should reach out to her. And she's incredibly approachable. And Crystal, so if you are somebody who's an agent here and you, you know, I should be for burning for my own company. But that is not my intention today. My intention is to celebrate you and and and we don't have a lot of the things that that you and your team have. And I think that's great. So I'm super excited to have our listeners, you know, reach out. And also too, if you're an agent in another state and Chicago is one of your feeder markets or it's one of the places people go to when they're maybe first in your market and they come here or they leave here and go there. She needs to connect with agents and those relationships as well. And the other thing too is rentals, right? Rentals are a lot of times for agents not in this area. You know, Chicago is a big hub for business. And so people come in, maybe they're only here a year or two, they're just going to be renting, they're going to maybe their company is going to pay for it. And these are people that spend five to 10 grand a month on or their company's pay for it. And they're getting a condo and it's an apartment that's very expensive. And they really need somebody that understands that luxury market and Crystal doesn't just work in luxury. But she certainly knows that world. You know, that's also a great reason to reach out to her because that's a really important thing. And people who are just doing leasing oftentimes their skill set isn't as developed as somebody who's a luxury brokerage brand like yours. And so, so that's another reason to reach out. And also too, for people that aren't doing rentals and rentals are tough. They're not easy. But what a great way to start a relationship with somebody who's almost certainly going to be buying in the future, right? So just or that might buy when they're actually thinking they're going to rent. Yeah, you might be able to switch them and say, hey, well, these rental prices, you know, they're so high. Well, this is what it looks like to buy or maybe, you know, if you're sick and tired of living in these apartment buildings that have thin walls and so many people and them, you're waiting for the elevator. Let's get into let's get you into something that feels like home. Right. I want to ask you what a couple last final questions about how what you tell your team to focus on. And I know again, there's a million things people can do and there's not one answer to this question. But, you know, if someone comes to you and they say, hey, I am struggling with lead generation, for example, and yes, you can help them with leads that your team has, then you can help distribute, but for their only generation, you know, what might you suggest as a way to help them sort of start improving that skill and getting more people in their database? You know, getting getting active on social. Yeah, reconnecting with people like friends from high school, old jobs, families, cousins, third cousins, well, whoever, you know, reconnecting with them and then obviously posting on social media because out of sight, out of mind, I think, you know, and social media just gives us, it makes it easier for us to have conversations. In fact, sometimes like we don't even start the conversation about our team or real estate. It's someone else mentioning, oh, hey, I see what you're doing on real estate. Oh, I, you know, so it just helps with that branding and marketing and spreading the message a lot faster where you don't always have to be the one to do the work, where if they are thinking about renting or buying or selling, they see a post and they'll say, oh, I should give Sam a call, right? He's really consistent, he's very professional, he's always showing up and he's got a lot of people that trust him because they like and come in on his post. Same thing on the other side too, right? Like I think the easiest ones are birthdays, anniversaries, selling anniversaries. And then from that layer is like getting into your contact list and just, you know, touching base with people, getting on their radar, asking them for the business, which is the most important part. Like everyone just assumes, oh, yeah, he liked my post, he likes every post that I put up there. He's going to call me when he's ready to sell him. It's like, that's not the case. If someone's liking your post, call them and say, hey, I see you liking everything. Thank you so much for the support for you guys. And like, I just wanted to reach out and just say, thank you. And you know, always appreciate you, like throwing those thumbs up, like what's going on in life, right? So, you know, that is such a great little mini tip that I don't think anyone has ever shared on the show before. And we have over 700 episodes. You just gave a really great reason to pick up the phone. And, and we do appreciate when people put the like on or they comment on a post. And it isn't reason to reach out and to say, you know, hey, I posted this content, you seem to appreciate it. I just want to let you know, I appreciate that it was good that you liked it and that it was helpful to you. And I'd just love to learn more about what's going on with you right now. Like what's, and you could also look in their feed as well to see what's going on in their life. And see, I saw you just went on vacation or whatever. But it's a conversation starter. And I don't think anyone has ever in our history of episodes talked about calling people who like a post. I think that is brilliant. Yeah, it's like taking it all the way home, right? It's like you're posting something they're liking it and then you're going back to them and saying, hey, like you're on my radar. Like, let's talk what's going on. And anyone, I mean, it's just how referrals work, right? It's like, you see someone you run into in the grocery store and then a week later they're referring you somebody. It's because they saw you. And so there's just all these layers to it. But I think the most important one that we still struggle with till today is, you know, you get that buyer, you get clients you're running around with, you're showing them homes and they get burnt out, they stop. They're, they're, you know, lives change. And we just leave them in the dark. We don't ever reach back out and say, hey, you know, things got really hard last time. Where are they at? Like, I still remember that you wanted to buy this and do that. And I just want to know how, like, how can we help you? Right? And just by you having that conversation, whether they want to work with you or they might know someone else that wants to work with you. So I think picking up that ball, because everyone is always ready to like, oh, I got this newly. They want to go look at houses. Let's look at 30 houses. And then the buyer's like, um, don't really see anything. I like, so I'll just, I'll reach out to you. Don't call me. I'll reach out to you. And the agents are like, yeah, he said he's in a call me. And then all of a sudden, that guy posted a photo that he bought a condo with a different REALTOR, right? So it's like, we're not, we're going through and doing all that upfront work of educating, driving them around, you know, like telling them all about HWA's and finding out all these questions and answers and running all these comps. And it's like, we're doing all that work up front and like, literally not, not bringing it to the finish line. Well, and I always think, I always think too, like, you don't, the fortune is in the follow-up for sure. And just like we were saying earlier, easier for me to find a whole new list of people I haven't talked to and say, you should check out Kale Realty. We're so amazing. And instead of going back to the people I've already talked to and say, hey, let's, let's check in. Where are you out in the process? What, what are you, you know, and it's, it's for some reason, it's more fun for me to go to the new people. And I think that's like you were saying, it's easy to go to the new leads. And going back to those existing leads is really, really important. And if we think like, well, we're bothering those people, it's like, you're not. And here's the reason, here's how you know you're not. We have technology now that basically makes it that if they do not want to chat with you, they will not pick up the phone. They will watch the transcription of the voice mail you're leaving in real time now as it's being transcribed by our phones, literally reading it as you're saying it. They are, if they don't want to talk to you, it's not like you're going to catch them off guard and you're going to get them at a bad time. And they're going to be like, I'm in the middle of this and I can't really, like, that's just not going to happen anymore. So when you call them, if they don't answer, it doesn't mean they don't like you, of course, but like don't worry about it. Like just leave them in the message and can keep following up and they're going to appreciate that. I love people that are persistent. And quite frankly, I just don't answer the phone if I don't want to talk to somebody. It doesn't mean I don't like them. It just might be... Yeah, just timing. So I think that is such a great tip is just go back to the people that maybe even maybe you even drop the ball on and like that's okay too to even acknowledge, hey, you know, I feel like maybe I didn't give you enough attention a few months ago and I want to rebuild the relationship and maybe you say it in a different way. But there's a way to do that too and really show that like you want to do better and meet their needs. And I think that's also super helpful. And the other side of it, which is like a negative, is like you get a no from the client, right? Oh, I bought something, you know, oh, I'm not really, but that's great because you get them off your list then. You get them off your follow-up list. Yeah. You know, the agents that are like, oh, I don't want to send a mass email because they're going to unsubscribe. It's like, well, we want them to unsubscribe because if they don't want to get our information, then they got to go, right? So then you're really purposely working and calling and talking to people that actually want to work and talk to you. Right. You know, so it's good to get the notes, you know, so it's like, we have to look at it in a positive way and be like, okay, they don't want to work with me. They don't feel like I'm the right person for them. Totally fine. Get them off the list. I'll stop calling. Let me call some other people. Great. So it's not a bad thing. Yeah, it's not a bad thing. Yeah, I unsubscribe from every newsletter from any company. The moment I'm like, I just don't need the service right now any longer. And it's not like, I don't like you. It's just, I don't want that clogging on my inbox, but I know how it can feel to the person seeing the unsubscribe because we did those as well. And it's almost like you almost have to remember like, this is, this is, we don't have enough information to know if this is a real rejection or not. This could just be timing. They don't want you in your inbox. It almost doesn't matter. If you can just like, I, for me, I just don't even look at those. I don't want to see them because I get bummed out. And I just, it gets removed from my database. That person gets put in a, in a different category. We revisit it down the road. And then we figure out if we want to reengage that person or not. But like, yeah, there's things. There's reasons why, you know, you really want to protect, you know, your, if you put things come in and it doesn't make you feel good, it's like, figure out a way to like not see that. But also, you know, have a process to where that person is, is, you know, you're not worrying about that person any longer. I think this is really a great place for us to wrap up. I just kind of have one last question, which is, I think, you know, you talk about burnout with clients. And I also think agent burnout is also super, super real too. So, you know, again, I always think, I don't think balance is possible. I think balance is a myth. But we can get close to it. I mean, it's close to having a balanced work life, home life, and set boundaries in a healthy way and be, you know, not, you know, work too hard where we're burning out. Where, how do you help your agents sort of figure out that balance? Yeah, I think, you know, going back to burnout, it's really easy for someone on our team to burn out because after you're probably on the team for like two months, three months, you're probably getting access to anywhere from three to five buyer leads a day. Wow. Calls. So like, you're either picking up up or you're, these are live, these are live transfer phone calls. These are calls. They're not live transfer anymore because now it's like, it's connected with showing time because the loan showing time. And so they can request a time on the website. But they're still directly connected to a client. Yeah. And I think it's like at the beginning of the new age, you're like, oh, my God, opportunity. Yes, I'll take all of them. I'll take all of them. But really, in the long run, it's like, you shouldn't take all of them. You should actually pace yourself. And you should actually only take, you know, five a week, even though you have access to 25, don't take 20 or 15, take five. And it might not sound like a lot, but it will be a lot, especially if you have five to seven buyers, you're trying to juggle at the same time. And so getting back to that burnout is like going back to knowing when to say no or stop or pause and knowing yourself. Like, if you, if you feel yourself getting burned out, like, hey, take a personal day, get someone to cover your showings, your clients will understand, right? Like, I don't think I've ever lost a client because they're like, oh, my God, you had someone else cover the show, I can't believe that. Like, everyone knows that like, there's a lot of moving parts we're trying to accommodate everyone, especially the buyer schedule, seller schedule. And, and you just have to know yourself a little bit more and to know when you need those pauses in your calendar. So if it's like, hey, every quarter, I need to go on a vacation or just need to vegetate at home, do it, you know, like don't feel guilty. And, and I think people have to learn how to work smarter because like in real estate, you know, we think we're putting in a six hour day, but like two of it was like scrolling Instagram. And the other one was like, you know, puttin around and we call that work, but it's like, why don't we try to work smarter so that we can actually be more productive in a short time frame than to sit at something for such a long time and like, you know, give your whole day to it. So, so it's more about protecting your time, your time, your headspace, your energy. And I think this is where accountability and coaching comes in. And I think teams, if they're structured correctly, can provide that. They can not only provide sort of, you know, hey, I need help. I need to take a day and someone on the team help me, you know, cover some of my responsibilities. Yes. But then there's also like, hey, I've got this problem. I got this thing, the situation. I don't know what to do. The team can help solve that problem. And also, hey, I don't know how to answer this particular question around an objection that the team can say, hey, here's how I do it. And there's a camaraderie to all of this. And there's also a, hey, I need some help staying accountable. I need some help, you know, someone needs to call me at 4 p.m. and say, did you make your dials today? And, and the teams can help you. You know, again, none of these things are inherently something to feel bad about. They're just, you just have to buy a solution to it. And, you know, I, I joke that, and it's not even a joke, but it's something I'm not, it's a little embarrassing for me to say, but it works. Is I have somebody that calls me every morning at 6 a.m. to make sure I'm awake. And I'm 49 years old. I'd like to say that I don't need that because there's alarms. And I have all sorts of other technology to wake me up. And yet, I have somebody who calls me at 6 a.m. to make sure. And so what I do is I set my alarm for 555. So that the person doesn't have to call me and I message them at 5 p.m. I'd say, I'm good, I'm good. You don't have to call me. But it's a little bit something that I kind of like wish I didn't have to have that, but I do have it. It's accountability and it works. And guess what? I wake up. So it almost doesn't matter like what you need. You just need people that can help solve problems for you. And you can't solve all the problems yourself. And so teams like crystals is really great for just helping help me solve problems. You know, whether it's I need more leads, I need to generate my own leads. I need more accountability. I need to increase my skills. You know, crystal inner team, this is what they do. And if you are somebody that comes in with heroes, my challenges, you know, might be a good fit for crystal inner team because they might have solutions for you. They are very solutions focused.
