[00:01:13] And now on to our show.
[00:01:29] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents
[00:01:36] and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide and host through the show. And this is
[00:01:41] a very special episode. I could not be more excited to share this with you. So let's just get
[00:01:48] right to it. I am proud to announce, gosh, this is years in the making. The show, by the way,
[00:01:53] is six or seven years old. And we've been talking about our team has talked, been talking about
[00:01:58] doing this for over a year now. We're finally doing it. So here's what I want you to do. Save the date,
[00:02:04] January 7th, 2025. By the way, 12 p.m. Central January 7th, 2025. Why? What is going on that day? Well,
[00:02:14] Keeping It Real is hosting their very first ever live webinar with sessions that we have that are
[00:02:21] really going to teach you how to crush it and have the best year ever. We're calling it the
[00:02:26] blueprint to becoming a top agent in 2025. Now here's what this entails. This will be live webinar
[00:02:33] sessions that you can attend from anywhere. And we have some pretty amazing experts on the bill.
[00:02:40] First off, to see who we have on the bill, you can visit KeepingItRealWebinar.com. That will take
[00:02:46] you to the page with all the information about the speakers and how to sign up and attend.
[00:02:52] But let me tell you more about these sessions because these are so cool. So one of our sessions is
[00:02:59] from one of the very top producers in the United States. His name is Greg Pekarski. And he is
[00:03:06] going to be teaching you lead generation secrets from a $220 million annual producer. Yes, you heard
[00:03:14] that right. He does two. He did 220 million this year, usually does just a little bit less than
[00:03:20] that he had his best year ever. This year, he was up 84% year over year that he did 431 sales.
[00:03:29] He is the king of lead generation. And he's going to tell you exactly what he and his team do to
[00:03:35] keep those leads role again. Also, we're going to talk to him about how he pivoted in 2024 so that his
[00:03:42] production actually went up. I don't know too many agents that had there one of their best years ever.
[00:03:47] And certainly they weren't up from this year to last year at that high level. And Greg is,
[00:03:52] and he's willing to share with you exactly how he and his team do it. And what you should be doing
[00:03:57] in 2025 to get some of that success that he's having because he would love to see that.
[00:04:03] Now, here's a second session we're running, which is with our very own Kim Rettberg. She is our
[00:04:09] video expert. Kim comes from the world of traditional media and online media. She has worked for some
[00:04:16] of the biggest studios in the country. And she is comes on every month here and shows tells you how to
[00:04:23] crush it and kill it with video. She has amazing content. And she is going to do just that again for us
[00:04:30] live so that you can interact with her. And by the way, you are going to be able to interact with our
[00:04:36] guests. We'll be asking questions. I'll be interacting with you, which is exciting for me because I don't
[00:04:40] really get to interact with you that much. So this is fun because I want to know how this is working for
[00:04:45] you. But here's Kim session, social media video mastery, how to generate leads while you sleep.
[00:04:52] So Kim is going to be teaching you all of the top video secrets, whether you're new to video or
[00:04:57] whether you just want to add it into your business. Let's help you get more leads more easily through
[00:05:02] video. And our third session, this is a really cool one. And I'm so excited. We had to really think
[00:05:09] about how we were going to do this because this is a tough one to pull off. But I think we got it.
[00:05:13] So who we have, I'll tell you first who we have. And then what we're doing. So this is really exciting.
[00:05:18] There is an amazing REALTOR coaching company out there called the locker room. I know they're
[00:05:24] amazing because we hire them to be the coaches for our agents. We have 800 agents here at Kale Realty
[00:05:30] in Chicago. The locker room is the very best training program I've ever found. And I've been around
[00:05:36] a long time. I've seen a lot of them. The locker room, they are just so skilled. And what we're going to
[00:05:42] do is a live coaching session with Brett Scott who works with our agents directly. He's amazing.
[00:05:50] And he's going to walk you through what we call the agent wheel. We're going to identify
[00:05:54] opportunities for you that are in your business right now that you aren't aware of. And also areas
[00:06:00] of improvement. Where can we round out that wheel so that all of your skills are working perfectly
[00:06:06] for you. Trust me, this is so cool. You are going to walk away with this with actually an idea
[00:06:12] of exactly what to do. Going forward and Bren is also going to be there along the way to help you
[00:06:18] figure out how to interpret this wheel. And then what to do with it going forward. Guys, this is
[00:06:24] huge. I'm so excited to be able to present this to you. All I can ask is that you give it a look
[00:06:30] and we'd love to have you. There is a cost for this because we're putting on a live event. So we
[00:06:34] have some expenses, but we wanted to keep it really affordable and realistic. And that fee is $49.
[00:06:41] So by the way, what you're going to get for that, of course, is the ability to attend live and
[00:06:46] interact with the guests, ask questions, participate in the live coaching. And of course, get all the
[00:06:52] recording videos afterwards so that you can watch them over and over and over again. So
[00:06:58] and by the way, I do have to say this and I know this is going to sound like a sales technique. I
[00:07:03] promise it is not. We literally do have limited options or limited seating on this one.
[00:07:08] For our first one, we wanted to keep it pretty small just to make sure we can handle it.
[00:07:12] And everybody's going to get their value. So it is limited to a certain number of attendees.
[00:07:17] So I would encourage you if this isn't any way interesting to you, go ahead and sign up. Please
[00:07:23] January 7th, 2025 and 12 p.m. We think it's going to run about three hours. So please sign up
[00:07:31] today before we max out our capacity again. The website to visit is keeping it real webinar.com.
[00:07:38] That will take you right to the page, which will show you all about the different sessions and how
[00:07:43] to sign up and attend. Please feel free to tell other agents in your local market about this event.
[00:07:50] Send them this episode so they can possibly sign up as well. We can provide us so much value. And we
[00:07:57] really think this is just the next level of the way that we can help agents through our podcast.
[00:08:04] So please thank you so much. Please thank you. We really appreciate it. And I'm excited to see
[00:08:08] everybody on January 7th. Again, keeping it real webinar is the place to check everything out.
[00:08:14] And as always, thank you for listening to this episode. Thank you for supporting our show and
[00:08:18] thank you in advance for supporting this amazing event that we're putting together. And I just
[00:08:23] can't wait to see everybody there. Have a great holiday season and I'll see you in January.
