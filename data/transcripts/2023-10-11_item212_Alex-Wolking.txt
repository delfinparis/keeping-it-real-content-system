[00:01:40] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:01:41] I'm your guide and host through the show in just a moment.
[00:01:44] I'm going to be speaking with top producer Alex Wolking.
[00:01:47] Before we get to Alex, just a couple of reminders.
[00:01:50] The best way that you can help our show is really two things.

[00:02:27] milestone for us.
[00:02:28] So I thank you for sharing it, telling a friend and continuing to listen.
[00:02:33] But let's get to the main event, my conversation with Alex Wolking.
[00:02:49] Okay, today on the show, our guest is Alex Wolking with color Williams, one here in Chicago.
[00:02:56] And let me tell you more about Alex.
[00:02:58] He is a second generation broker and real estate was all he is and is all he is ever known
[00:03:04] at 12 years old.
[00:03:05] He began working for his father, who's a real estate veteran in the Quad Cities region
[00:03:09] of Illinois and Iowa.
[00:03:11] And 2011 at 19 years old, Wolking earned his Iowa real estate license and was awarded
[00:03:17] rookie of the year in 2012.
[00:03:19] Amazing.
[00:03:20] Wolking's small town roots taught him the importance of building strong relationships
[00:03:24] while maintaining discretion and while approaching negotiations with discernment.
[00:03:29] Wolking spent time away from Chicago after graduating from DePaul, which is here in Chicago.
[00:03:34] Before returning to Chicago in 2016, probably rebuilding his referral based network from scratch,
[00:03:40] Wolking has since received numerous accolades, including recognition as a top producer
[00:03:44] by the Chicago Association of REALTORS since 2019.
[00:03:48] A 2021 national association of REALTORS 30 under 30 on a re and regarded by real trends
[00:03:55] as a top 1.5% agent in America on the real trends 1000 list for 2022.
[00:04:01] Please, everyone check out Alex on his website Alex Wolking.com.

[00:04:08] .com link for that in the show notes and follow him on Instagram.
[00:04:13] Alex at Alex Wolking, we will have a link to that in the show notes as well.
[00:04:17] Alex, welcome to the show.
[00:04:18] Thanks for having me, DJ.
[00:04:20] Good to finally meet you.
[00:04:21] I am.
[00:04:22] Yeah, I am super excited to meet you.
[00:04:24] Alex is a little bit of a celebrity here in the Chicago real estate.
[00:04:28] I would say a rising star, but I feel like your star is already risen,
[00:04:32] but it's still continuing to rise.
[00:04:34] And I am so excited to get to talk to you because I'm always,
[00:04:38] to me, it's always impressive when people who are younger and you have,
[00:04:42] gosh, you started so, so young, you know, we're able to find success so,
[00:04:46] so quickly.
[00:04:47] And I know it's through tremendous, tremendous hard work,
[00:04:50] but we would love to hear a little bit of your story.
[00:04:52] So let's go back to the beginning.
[00:04:54] Tell us how you got into real estate.
[00:04:57] Yeah, so when I was 12,
[00:05:01] my, I'll never forget, I always tell the story.
[00:05:03] My dad, as you know, was a real estate broker in the Quad Cities,
[00:05:08] and actually back in March of this year, it was his 30th year in business.
[00:05:13] And I was 12, he called me and he was like, hey, I need you to log into this website
[00:05:20] and print this thing out for me.
[00:05:22] Well, it was the MLS and he wanted a listing sheet printed out because he was
[00:05:26] driving by on his way to a showing.
[00:05:29] I didn't know what he did, but I was so fascinated by the system.
[00:05:32] I started diving through it and I just thought it was so cool.
[00:05:36] And then later that week, he went to go meet with a single mom first time home buyer.
[00:05:42] She had two daughters that were about my age.
[00:05:44] And again, I had never seen what my dad did for a living.
[00:05:48] And we went to this house and he went across the street.
[00:05:54] There was a Wendy's across the street.
[00:05:56] And we're sitting there.
[00:05:57] And actually, the listing sheet that I printed was for this house.
[00:06:01] And I saw, we sat down and my dad just became this other person that was so cool.
[00:06:08] I saw him, like this woman was so nervous and scared.
[00:06:13] And her two daughters were about me and my brother's age.
[00:06:16] And so we're sitting there eating our burgers or whatever.
[00:06:20] And watching my dad help this woman navigate buying a house and putting her at ease.
[00:06:26] And then later, hearing the phone call of when he called and said you got the house.
[00:06:30] And you could hear her like scream with excitement over the phone.
[00:06:34] That was when I saw the whole arc of what my dad did.
[00:06:37] And I thought it was the coolest thing ever.
[00:06:40] And so I just became obsessed.
[00:06:42] And I was so obsessed that at 12 years old, I got on my bike and went to open houses
[00:06:46] because my mom wouldn't take me.
[00:06:47] I just wanted to help dad out.
[00:06:49] I thought it was the coolest thing.
[00:06:50] I wanted to help him do more of that.
[00:06:53] So I started doing going to open houses on my bike to learn the market and help him out.
[00:06:58] I went to, you know, when I turned 16, I went to 229 open houses that year.
[00:07:04] I got to know the whole real estate community and other agents would call my dad and be like,
[00:07:09] your son came through my open house today.
[00:07:14] He took some of the cookies.
[00:07:16] I did.
[00:07:18] So they, but you know what, help those I would go on other agents.
[00:07:21] There were some ages I would make a point to go to their open houses because I would hear how they
[00:07:25] would talk to clients that came through.
[00:07:27] I would hear how they worked.
[00:07:29] I could test out who's a good agent who wasn't.
[00:07:32] And I could, there were some agents I would just go and they liked me so much that
[00:07:37] sometimes I would just go sit their open houses with them and just watch them work and listen to them.
[00:07:42] And that's so I got, you know, by the time I was 19, I got licensed.
[00:07:47] I have already graduated real estate high school.
[00:07:53] That is, that is an incredible story.
[00:07:57] And you know, we've done about 500 episodes and that is one of the more unique stories that I have
[00:08:03] heard. I love it.
[00:08:04] And it's a good reminder for everyone listening that open houses are the way.
[00:08:09] They are the way.
[00:08:11] I was joking.
[00:08:12] I mean, I was taught the old school way, DJ.
[00:08:14] I mean, I, you know, so many agents today that get into the business are taught social media and
[00:08:19] marketing yourself in video.
[00:08:21] I learned the old school old fashioned way.
[00:08:24] I've all, I've all bellied a bellied toe to toe.
[00:08:26] And I was, you know, open houses door knocking.
[00:08:30] I mean, the handwritten notes.
[00:08:32] We had such a small town Midwest thing.
[00:08:35] And that's really ultimately what I still built my business and have
[00:08:39] accredited a lot of my success to today.
[00:08:41] And I had great teachers too.
[00:08:43] I had great teachers growing up.
[00:08:46] Yeah.
[00:08:46] My dad never, I have to say this, my dad never ran real estate down my throat.
[00:08:51] I think a lot of real estate just want their kids to get into the business,
[00:08:54] to want their spouse to get in.
[00:08:55] He always let me discover on my own and he never pushed it.
[00:08:58] I think that's part of the reason I liked it so much because it was never forced on me.
[00:09:02] Well, you got your license at 19.
[00:09:05] So you were in college, I guess at that time.
[00:09:07] Andy were in college here in Chicago and you got your license in India,
[00:09:11] I'm sorry, in Iowa, which is not super convenient.
[00:09:14] But so tell us about that.
[00:09:16] Yeah. So I went to, I went, I did not have the traditional college career.
[00:09:22] I got licensed halfway through my freshman year and I got, so I went home on weekends.
[00:09:28] I went home every summer.
[00:09:29] I went home on spring break.
[00:09:31] I went home for a holiday break because, you know,
[00:09:34] DePaul's off from Thanksgiving New Year's.
[00:09:36] I went home that whole time.
[00:09:37] I didn't have my first Chicago summer until I moved back in 2016 or 2017, really.
[00:09:43] Because I just wanted to work, but by the time I graduated,
[00:09:47] I had already had a book of business and clients I was working with.
[00:09:50] So I graduated from DePaul and I moved back home to Quad Cities the next day.
[00:09:56] And I graduated from the reason I went to DePaul in the first place was because they had
[00:10:00] in their college of commerce, they actually had a degree in real estate.
[00:10:04] And that was what my training was in.
[00:10:06] It was more commercial focus, finance, development, you know, that sort of thing.
[00:10:11] And nothing to do with brokerage or sales, but I could go sell commercial real estate tomorrow
[00:10:15] if I wanted to, but I don't want to.
[00:10:19] You know, people sell commercial I have the utmost respect for because it seems just like,
[00:10:24] I don't think I've this stomach to do it.
[00:10:26] It's a, it's a lot, a lot of stress.
[00:10:27] But, but anyway, so what's so amazing about your story is, is you would think, you know,
[00:10:34] hey, dad's got this incredible business back home.
[00:10:36] He's, he's established, he's respected.
[00:10:38] I have my license.
[00:10:40] Maybe I partner up with dad or maybe I build my own brand there,
[00:10:43] but certainly the name is, is a name people may know.
[00:10:46] And so that would obviously be a huge leg up.
[00:10:48] You've already sat hundreds of open houses.
[00:10:50] You know the good REALTORS.
[00:10:51] You've already established yourself and you have a book of business there.
[00:10:54] So you would assume that that's where you ended up.
[00:10:57] But you didn't and you decided to come here and, and I want to make sure that people know that
[00:11:01] even though Alex said, hey, during college, when to schooled Chicago, he would go home on the weekends.
[00:11:06] It's not like we're that close to the Quad Cities.
[00:11:08] It's what at least two hours, maybe.
[00:11:10] So I have to three hours.
[00:11:11] Yeah.
[00:11:12] 
[00:11:12] So I grew up in Puri, Illinois, about three hours away from Chicago as well.
[00:11:16] And the, I didn't go to school in Puri, but the idea of traveling like that on the weekends
[00:11:19] would have just driven me nuts.
[00:11:21] But regardless, you were really set up to build your business in Iowa or, or,
[00:11:25] you're right on the Quad Cities, which is Iowa and Illinois, but not Chicago at all.
[00:11:29] And then you were like, I'm going to come back to Chicago and you had to start completely over.
[00:11:34] 
[00:11:35] So how did you do that?
[00:11:37] So this is where one Mr. Phil Buyers comes into play.
[00:11:40] So, Phil Buyers, who is now with Compass.
[00:11:45] When I was 18 years old, my dad was a teen leader of the Quad Cities office and
[00:11:50] Kelle Wynne's Quad Cities office.
[00:11:53] And the, and so I was moving up here to go to Paul.
[00:11:57] And my dad reached out to Phil, who was the teen leader at the time.
[00:12:02] And he said, you know, I've got this son.
[00:12:05] He's going to Paul.
[00:12:06] He loves real estate yet.
[00:12:07] Anything for him to do.
[00:12:09] And Phil's like, yeah, I'm sure we can find something for him to do.
[00:12:12] And my dad's like, Alex is, um, Alex is, uh, he's a neat kid.
[00:12:19] He's up the phone.
[00:12:21] And that Phil will tell you that story like it was yesterday.
[00:12:26] And so I come barreling in the Phil's office.
[00:12:28] I had an hour long meeting with him.
[00:12:31] And he, he just looked to me and he's like, I will help you do it every want to do.
[00:12:36] So when I went at the end of 2015, I was 23 years old.
[00:12:40] I was number three in the Quad Cities office.
[00:12:43] And I was at the top 50 agents on the border eliters there.
[00:12:46] And I had helped ring to my dad that year.
[00:12:52] Which I'm sure he was both proud of and disappointed by.
[00:12:56] But at the end of 2015, you know, I did really well.
[00:13:01] And I had built up a book of business of just unique homes.
[00:13:05] That was my niche was hard to sell stuff.
[00:13:08] And, but I knew it is a 23 year old single gay man.
[00:13:14] The Quad Cities was not the place for me.
[00:13:16] Oh, that is all of our phones are going off right now.
[00:13:20] It's the, this is the second time ever that they are testing.
[00:13:24] I learned about this the other day, the emergency broadcast system.
[00:13:26] So that's what you might have just heard.
[00:13:28] Mine will be coming in the next few seconds.
[00:13:30] So I will deal with that.
[00:13:32] So Alex has just got it.
[00:13:34] But no big deal.
[00:13:35] We will, we will cut that out.
[00:13:38] So anyway, as a young 23 year old single gay man,
[00:13:43] I knew that the Quad Cities, especially after I had been there,
[00:13:47] it was not the place for me to be at that time of my life anyway.
[00:13:50] And I knew, especially after having lived in Chicago,
[00:13:53] I mean, the greatest cities actually just voted one of the best cities in America
[00:13:57] for the seventh year in a row.
[00:14:00] I knew that I wanted more for myself.
[00:14:03] And I knew I would regret it if I didn't move back to Chicago.
[00:14:07] So I was terrified.
[00:14:09] And I worked for Phil in college.
[00:14:10] I was an intern on his team when he was at properties at the time.
[00:14:14] So I went back and he had the other my internship.
[00:14:16] He said, well, you know, if you ever decide to come back,
[00:14:20] your job will always be here.
[00:14:21] And I was like, okay, great.
[00:14:22] So I filed that away.
[00:14:25] Cut to January of 2020 or 2016,
[00:14:31] I messaged him late on a Thursday night and I said,
[00:14:34] Hey, I'm thinking about coming back Chicago.
[00:14:36] Can I talk to you about taking my old job back on buyer's home team?
[00:14:41] Any and I was coming up to,
[00:14:43] I wasn't planning coming up to the city that weekend,
[00:14:45] but he said Saturday morning,
[00:14:47] 9 am my office, bring coffee.
[00:14:50] And I was like, okay, so I got my car and I drove up,
[00:14:54] you know, Friday night.
[00:14:55] I walked into his office at Saturday morning and he's like,
[00:14:58] so you want to come back Chicago?
[00:14:59] I said, yeah, I want to come back Chicago.
[00:15:01] Can I come work as a buyer's agent for you on buyer's home team?
[00:15:03] And he's like, what?
[00:15:05] No, you'll be fine on your own.
[00:15:08] You see that empty desk across the hallway?
[00:15:09] Sit your ass over there.
[00:15:11] You'll be just fine without me.
[00:15:12] You don't need a team.
[00:15:13] You don't need me.
[00:15:14] You don't need anybody else.
[00:15:15] You will be fine on your own.
[00:15:18] Just get your ass here.
[00:15:19] It was like, oh, okay.
[00:15:21] He's like, when's your slowest time there?
[00:15:22] I was like, right around September.
[00:15:24] He's like, great.
[00:15:25] Start telling everybody that you know
[00:15:26] that you're moving to Chicago on September.
[00:15:28] Figure out the plan later,
[00:15:29] but just tell everybody that you're moving.
[00:15:32] Okay, I was at that time, I was 24.
[00:15:35] And so I started telling people,
[00:15:37] I'm moving back to Chicago.
[00:15:38] And people were like, what?
[00:15:39] And I was like, I don't know, I'm gonna figure it out.
[00:15:41] So, while we hold, I signed at least September 1st of 2016.
[00:15:47] And I came back and then I transitioned my business
[00:15:51] for about two years of 2017, 2018.
[00:15:54] I partnered with an agent of the Quad Cities
[00:15:56] to kind of take over my business there.
[00:15:58] And then, so I still was like part time here
[00:16:01] my first two years, but I didn't go full time here
[00:16:03] until January 1st of 2019.
[00:16:06] Wow.
[00:16:07] And how did you build the business here
[00:16:10] when you had such a strong foot hold there?
[00:16:14] I'm sure there may be a little bit of overlap,
[00:16:15] maybe people moving, but usually people,
[00:16:18] the Quad Cities stay in the Quad Cities,
[00:16:19] same with Puri or I'm from.
[00:16:21] So it's not like, oh, this is an easy transition.
[00:16:24] No, it's, you were literally starting over.
[00:16:26] So how did you do it?
[00:16:28] Oh, man.
[00:16:29] You know, DJ, I'm still figuring that out too.
[00:16:33] I think, you know, I've just always been born
[00:16:35] with the gift of unbridled tenacity.
[00:16:40] And I've never, you know, there's not a conversation
[00:16:43] I've straight away from, there's not a, you know,
[00:16:46] I have no problem picking up a phone.
[00:16:49] But what really did it when I first came back,
[00:16:52] I mean, teller Williams came in really handy
[00:16:55] as an international brand.
[00:16:57] Because for years, I'd gone to all the conferences,
[00:16:59] I had made a bunch of friends and built relationships
[00:17:01] with other ages around the country.
[00:17:03] They didn't know anybody in Davenport, Iowa
[00:17:05] or Molina, Illinois.
[00:17:07] But when I moved to Chicago, I made the big announcement,
[00:17:09] everybody knew somebody in Chicago.
[00:17:12] So my first four years,
[00:17:14] 70% of my business was age of referrals.
[00:17:17] And that was, that was a huge part of my business.
[00:17:21] Yeah, I've been to about 2020, 2021 really.
[00:17:25] And then it just, of course, then it snowed, right?
[00:17:28] I mean, you got, I sent out just sold postcards
[00:17:30] around every property I sold.
[00:17:32] Like my first year here in 2017,
[00:17:35] I closed 10 properties for like 2.7 million.
[00:17:39] And then in 2018, I did 13 units for like five million.
[00:17:45] And then in 2019, I sold 28 homes for 15 million.
[00:17:51] So just it snowed all, literally doubled year over year.
[00:17:55] And then I hired Kevin, my assistant,
[00:17:58] my director of operations now.
[00:18:01] And then from 2020, we went from 28 closed units
[00:18:06] and 15 and a half million to 52 units for 26 million.
[00:18:12] So it's just, I mean, that's kind of where I've hovered
[00:18:15] the last two years is around that $25, $30 million mark.
[00:18:19] And it's, you know, that's, you know, as they say,
[00:18:23] take the leap of faith and trust in that will catch you.
[00:18:25] And it sure did.
[00:18:27] Yeah, it's, it's so funny because you,
[00:18:31] you know, you in your early, in your teen years
[00:18:33] really did a lot of the heavy lifting
[00:18:37] that people even when they get their license,
[00:18:40] oftentimes don't do.
[00:18:42] And look, I mean, you know, it's, it's never too late
[00:18:45] to get in shape.
[00:18:46] It's never too late to start building skills.
[00:18:48] It's never too late for, for anything in life
[00:18:51] if you put the effort in and you had obviously,
[00:18:55] you probably saw, I'm sure your father worked extremely hard
[00:18:58] as an a successful agent, every successful agent does.
[00:19:01] And so you saw his work ethic and then you were able
[00:19:04] to also participate without really being in the industry
[00:19:07] for, for some time.
[00:19:09] And boy, you, you know, it reminds me of a story.
[00:19:14] So here in Chicago, one of the top agents, we, and by the way,
[00:19:18] Alex is mentioning Phil Buyers.
[00:19:19] We have an episode we've done with Phil Buyers.
[00:19:21] He is an exceptional person to listen to.
[00:19:24] He's, he's trained and coached numerous agents.
[00:19:27] He's with Compass.
[00:19:28] You can go back through our archives and find Phil's episode.
[00:19:31] It's, he's just such a wonderful human,
[00:19:32] one of one of my favorite people.
[00:19:35] And I was thinking about another episode that I've done here
[00:19:38] in Chicago that your story reminded me of.
[00:19:41] So for people in Chicago who are listening,
[00:19:43] you'll know this name, but everyone else might not.
[00:19:45] His name's Matt Larassese, one of the big producers,
[00:19:47] one of the biggest actually of about 46,000 agents in Chicago.
[00:19:51] And he's one or two or three, and he's always at the top.
[00:19:54] And what, when I had him on the show millions of years ago,
[00:19:58] he, he told me that his first five years in the business,
[00:20:00] I think he only sold, I can't remember exactly 12 homes total
[00:20:04] in five years.
[00:20:06] And I said, he did and he goes, well, I was living at home,
[00:20:08] so I didn't have to pay for rent.
[00:20:09] And he goes, but I considered it going to college.
[00:20:12] Like you were saying, by the time you were 19,
[00:20:14] you're like, I've already put in my, you know,
[00:20:15] not maybe 10,000 hours, but I put it a lot of hours.
[00:20:18] And he would just get up every day and walk around
[00:20:21] River North, which is where he wanted to specialize.
[00:20:23] And he went to every building and he just learned the inventory.
[00:20:26] And he goes, you know, I was poor for five years.
[00:20:29] I made no money.
[00:20:29] I was a little bit, it was a little embarrassing,
[00:20:32] but now he's, you know, at the very, very top of the mountain.
[00:20:35] So it's, you know, you have a similar story there.
[00:20:38] And I just, I'm so impressed with people
[00:20:40] that put in that amount of work because it's discipline.
[00:20:43] And it's not easy.
[00:20:44] Well, and you know, in addition to that, two DJs,
[00:20:47] I learned very early on, and I think some of the ages
[00:20:51] they get success really quickly and they just blow
[00:20:54] through every dollar they make, where, I mean,
[00:20:57] my first year in the business was 2011.
[00:20:59] That was the bottom of the market.
[00:21:03] Tough, tough, tough year.
[00:21:05] I didn't sell any, I got licensed April 2011.
[00:21:07] My first closing was until February 2012.
[00:21:11] And so I mean, I went a whole year without selling anything
[00:21:13] and I almost got out of business.
[00:21:16] And my first listing was actually FSBO
[00:21:19] that I had converted from Doornock.
[00:21:22] And my second listing was a short sale.
[00:21:25] And that was, I mean, I got in a very difficult market.
[00:21:28] So I've always been very cautious with how I spent my money
[00:21:31] by marketing dollars and how I, you know,
[00:21:33] where referrals come from.
[00:21:34] So like in markets like this year that have been challenging,
[00:21:37] a lot of agents are freaked out and scrambling, I'm not.
[00:21:40] Cause that I've been through that.
[00:21:42] And I watched my dad go through 2007 through 2010.
[00:21:45] And I, you know, I watched, you know, having grown up
[00:21:48] and then I've been through market cycles before.
[00:21:50] And how we would adapt and change in those markets.
[00:21:53] But what I wanted to say was, right, is I was actually
[00:21:56] making copies of my license at the copier ready to go.
[00:22:06] There we go.
[00:22:07] Okay.
[00:22:08] I was actually, so in December of 2011,
[00:22:11] I was about to drop my license.
[00:22:13] I was gonna go hang it.
[00:22:14] I was making copies of my license.
[00:22:16] I was going to the Quads New York Real Church
[00:22:17] for Association to turn it in.
[00:22:19] I had an appointment and everything.
[00:22:20] And the number one agent in the office at the time,
[00:22:22] I'm Deb Hausman.
[00:22:26] She saw what I was doing.
[00:22:27] She's like, what are you doing?
[00:22:28] I was like, I'm hanging my license.
[00:22:29] She's like, you're not gonna be in real estate anymore?
[00:22:33] And I was like, yeah, I think I'm just gonna finish my degree
[00:22:35] and I'll get in real estate after that.
[00:22:38] She's like, really?
[00:22:44] So she's like, I think you should give that some time.
[00:22:47] Like give it a few days.
[00:22:49] Let's don't do it today.
[00:22:49] I was like, all right.
[00:22:50] So I canceled my appointment.
[00:22:51] I went to dinner with my mom
[00:22:54] and I got a ping on my phone back in the day
[00:22:57] when I had a blackberry and I had a,
[00:23:01] I got an email from her.
[00:23:03] And this was, by this point, I was at home
[00:23:05] and it was probably like 11 o'clock at night,
[00:23:08] which is unlike Deb.
[00:23:09] She's missed, I'm in bed by 8.30 every night.
[00:23:12] It was an email from her saying,
[00:23:14] I couldn't sleep thinking about you getting out of the business.
[00:23:17] If it's not hard, it's not worth having.
[00:23:21] You need to go network more.
[00:23:23] And I was like, networking, what's networking?
[00:23:25] She's like, Alex, go make friends.
[00:23:29] And I was like, she's like, you need to go make friends.
[00:23:33] So I'm a business today because of Deb Hausman
[00:23:35] and I built my business on her advice.
[00:23:38] Best advice I ever got in the industry was go make friends.
[00:23:43] That if I write a book someday
[00:23:44] about all my successes and adventures and my memoirs,
[00:23:48] the name of the book is gonna be called go make friends.
[00:23:50] You know, you're absolutely so right on.
[00:23:55] You know, we are wired for community,
[00:23:57] we're wired for connection, we want to support our friends,
[00:24:01] we want to help them with their endeavors.
[00:24:04] We oftentimes use our friends in a negative way,
[00:24:08] but we utilize our friends to, hey, who's your doctor?
[00:24:11] Who's your hairstylist? Who's your accountant?
[00:24:14] And who's your REALTOR?
[00:24:15] And so it is, you know, being likable is such an important
[00:24:21] and I don't mean changing who you are
[00:24:22] to fit someone else's needs.
[00:24:24] I just mean being somebody who's approachable,
[00:24:27] somebody who, whether you're introverted, extroverted,
[00:24:30] you can learn skills to, you know, be a likable person.
[00:24:35] And I always think that being likable
[00:24:40] is one of the key tenants of being in real estate.
[00:24:43] It's being somebody that can, people can talk to
[00:24:46] and they can bring their challenges and their stress
[00:24:49] and all of the ups and downs of a transaction.
[00:24:53] I mean, it is, every transaction stressful at some point,
[00:24:56] sometimes many times during it
[00:24:58] and the clients are stressing out just like,
[00:25:00] you know, you would expect and being somebody
[00:25:02] that they can come to and you're making this massive decision
[00:25:07] with, you know, financially and you get to be the one
[00:25:09] who's really guiding them is really,
[00:25:12] it's almost, you know, blessing may be a little bit
[00:25:15] of a strong word, but it's really,
[00:25:17] we're very fortunate to be in this kind of profession
[00:25:20] where we're literally guiding somebody through
[00:25:22] one of the more stressful parts of life
[00:25:24] is buying and selling homes.
[00:25:26] Yes, yes.
[00:25:27] And that advice of go make friends was literally how I,
[00:25:30] I've always approached my business and not only that,
[00:25:33] that was the mindset, the mentality I had
[00:25:36] when I moved back here to Chicago
[00:25:38] and just started over again was, I don't have to go make friends.
[00:25:41] And that was it.
[00:25:44] It's just incredible that you've built basically
[00:25:47] two businesses before the age of 30
[00:25:50] in two different locations,
[00:25:51] basically starting from scratch.
[00:25:53] Maybe you could argue in the Quad Cities,
[00:25:55] maybe you had some additional resources there,
[00:25:58] but you still put in the work,
[00:25:59] you still rode your bike to all of those open houses.
[00:26:01] What do you say to agents today who are starting out
[00:26:05] who maybe don't have the guidance that you were fortunate enough
[00:26:09] to have from your father and from Deb,
[00:26:13] once you got started and obviously Keller Williams,
[00:26:15] one Chicago here is a really, really well respected brand
[00:26:20] here locally, obviously internationally too,
[00:26:23] but you have a lot of great people at your firm
[00:26:26] and also people at Compass Filifiers.
[00:26:28] A lot of people are in your corner,
[00:26:30] but you asked, you went out and made those connections yourself.
[00:26:34] But let's talk, I want to talk about open houses
[00:26:35] just for a moment because I think it is,
[00:26:37] you were saying social media wasn't really the main driver
[00:26:41] for your business, but making friends
[00:26:44] and also sitting hundreds of open houses
[00:26:48] is really like, can you talk a little bit about what skills
[00:26:51] you learned by watching other REALTORS do that?
[00:26:53] Oh my God, so I don't know where to begin with that,
[00:26:57] because I'm an observer.
[00:27:00] I've always been a lifelong learner,
[00:27:02] I love being a student and a lot of what I learned
[00:27:06] was what to do and what not to do.
[00:27:09] You watch how a lot, if anything,
[00:27:12] I wasn't necessarily watching the agent,
[00:27:14] I was watching the buyers and the consumers coming through
[00:27:17] and what their reactions were to what the agent
[00:27:20] was saying or doing.
[00:27:22] And what I found doing that is that people
[00:27:25] like the element of surprise.
[00:27:28] And I think one of the biggest things I took away
[00:27:31] was never rob a buyer from the element of the business.
[00:27:36] I love surprise.
[00:27:37] Instead of saying, this kitchen has an amazing pantry,
[00:27:41] let them discover that, let them go and find that.
[00:27:45] When it came to converting,
[00:27:47] it was like just having a normal conversation with people,
[00:27:49] just ask them, oh you guys, where do you guys go
[00:27:52] to brunch today?
[00:27:52] And if you've been to this place around corner,
[00:27:54] there's just so many things like that
[00:27:57] of just being real, just being real with people.
[00:28:01] And then it's so easy to say, oh well, be yourself.
[00:28:05] Let's hard to do what you don't know who you are.
[00:28:08] But there's a, I think that was the way I saw
[00:28:11] the greatest response from consumers at open houses
[00:28:15] was when agents were real and relatable.
[00:28:19] And it instantly takes the guard down
[00:28:22] for a lot of consumers.
[00:28:24] So I mean, I used to dress up for open houses
[00:28:26] and I'd wear the suit and tie and brown shoes and all of that.
[00:28:30] And I what I found was that my conversion went up
[00:28:33] when I ditched the suit.
[00:28:35] Interesting.
[00:28:36] And Mr. Laracy will have you believing otherwise.
[00:28:41] But anyway, that's authentically him too.
[00:28:45] That's not me.
[00:28:47] And I also had to look at what markets I was serving.
[00:28:49] The Quad Cities is a very kind of blue collar area.
[00:28:54] And I always was more drawn to areas that just felt real.
[00:28:58] So for me, the vast majority of my business
[00:29:01] is late view uptown, edgewater,
[00:29:05] Ravenswood, Lincoln Square.
[00:29:06] I don't do, I sold in 2022, I sold 51 homes
[00:29:11] and only two of them were in Lincoln Park
[00:29:14] and both of them were in the same building.
[00:29:17] So it wasn't, that's just not my vibe.
[00:29:20] It's not my energy.
[00:29:22] I just love where I can be real.
[00:29:24] And the fact that, I mean, if I went to a $2 million
[00:29:27] listing appointment in Ravenswood
[00:29:29] and I showed up on a blue suit and brown shoes
[00:29:31] they throw me off the front porch.
[00:29:33] You know, they were you.
[00:29:34] Did you come from downtown?
[00:29:36] Like, do you work this neighborhood?
[00:29:40] That's, I had to find areas and markets
[00:29:43] that served the vibe and energy that I just liked.
[00:29:47] And I also had to find how I approach the business as well.
[00:29:53] For me, I'm brutally honest, like blunt force trauma.
[00:29:59] I'm a pro people, but I am authentic.
[00:30:03] And I know to a granular level, my market block by block
[00:30:09] which that's a level of expertise
[00:30:10] it takes years to refine.
[00:30:12] And when I came back to Chicago,
[00:30:14] I started that whole open house cycle all over again.
[00:30:16] If I wasn't doing open houses,
[00:30:18] I was going to open houses.
[00:30:19] I was going to every broker's open.
[00:30:21] Some of my greatest mentors in the business
[00:30:23] have come from that because I kept showing up
[00:30:25] over and over again.
[00:30:27] Aside from Phil Buyers,
[00:30:29] one of my other great mentors has been Millie Rosenblum.
[00:30:31] Oh, sure.
[00:30:32] I have a great story about Millie.
[00:30:35] One of my other biggest mentors has been Marlene Granke
[00:30:38] with Remix.
[00:30:40] Do you talk about somebody who knows the market
[00:30:42] forwards a backward side to side
[00:30:44] and knows what year the furnace was replaced in a house
[00:30:48] because she sold it three times.
[00:30:49] I mean, that woman knows her inventory.
[00:30:53] That's those are the kinds of agents I learned from growing up.
[00:30:57] And I see through it here in Chicago,
[00:30:59] I think a lot of you just want the glamour of the business
[00:31:02] and the glamour of the listing,
[00:31:04] but they don't know how to actually do the job.
[00:31:07] And they don't know how to navigate with ease and finesse.
[00:31:12] I think that's, you see it so much
[00:31:14] with the newer agents coming in.
[00:31:17] But true expertise, that's really missing.
[00:31:20] And that's something that I valued
[00:31:23] as a small town real estate agent,
[00:31:24] you have to have that.
[00:31:26] I've carried a lot of that small town mentality
[00:31:30] with me everywhere I've gone.
[00:31:32] How do you recommend that an agent
[00:31:34] who is newer to the business start to learn the market?
[00:31:38] Obviously, some obviously things come to mind.
[00:31:41] Go to the open houses, go to the broker opens
[00:31:43] if you're area where you're working has those.
[00:31:45] You know, obviously, immerse yourself out in the market.
[00:31:50] But when you're also studying the MLS,
[00:31:53] like how would you advise somebody to get started
[00:31:56] so that they can specialize in a particular area?
[00:31:59] Yeah, that's a great question.
[00:32:00] So what I did was I took a few small areas
[00:32:05] that I wanted to work in.
[00:32:08] And for me, I looked in Wayne Apark.
[00:32:10] I looked in, I wanted to do single family homes,
[00:32:14] North of Birmingham Park Road.
[00:32:15] So I wanted to do Wayne Apark,
[00:32:17] Grace in West, Ravenswood, Castlewood Terrace,
[00:32:21] you know, Edgewater Blend, Lakewood, Belmoral.
[00:32:24] And I took each of those areas
[00:32:27] in a very granular level.
[00:32:30] And I went back 10 years.
[00:32:33] I went back just to see, you know,
[00:32:35] how many homes turned over every year?
[00:32:37] What the price appreciation growth was?
[00:32:39] Who were the agents that were doing most of the deals there?
[00:32:42] Then I went to their open houses and I learned who they were.
[00:32:46] And I learned, okay, what makes that agent so unique
[00:32:49] for this area?
[00:32:50] The other thing I found too is some agent,
[00:32:56] is, you know, massive foothold in a market.
[00:33:00] And a lot of times what you find out is they don't.
[00:33:03] And they tout themselves the number one agent for the area.
[00:33:06] And they're, they've done like three deals.
[00:33:09] But, you know, perception is reality.
[00:33:11] So a lot of that, I would find, okay,
[00:33:13] if I'm gonna work in this neighborhood, what's my angle?
[00:33:16] But what I did in the Quad Cities
[00:33:18] and what served me extremely well here was,
[00:33:21] I started to identify markets that had a gaping hole in them
[00:33:25] where no one was working them,
[00:33:27] or the agents who were working them
[00:33:29] were not doing anything to innovate.
[00:33:32] They had no market share.
[00:33:34] So I just went after the markets that really weren't underserved.
[00:33:39] And that's where I started.
[00:33:40] That was first.
[00:33:42] And that was how I ended up working in my own neighborhood,
[00:33:46] my own backyard in Pointe Park,
[00:33:48] was I looked at all the single family homes
[00:33:50] on Hutchins the street and junior terrorists
[00:33:53] and around that little pocket on Casua Terrace.
[00:33:56] Nobody was working that market.
[00:33:57] Nobody was.
[00:33:59] And having come from the Quad Cities
[00:34:01] and having my knack and my skill set and my eye
[00:34:04] for selling really weird, funky, unique historic homes,
[00:34:09] that just fit into an interest of mine
[00:34:12] and a skill set of mine.
[00:34:14] So I was like, I'm the perfect agent
[00:34:15] to fit the role of this neighborhood
[00:34:17] and then I just started attacking it.
[00:34:20] I give architecture tours every summer,
[00:34:23] three times a summer, every summer for the last seven years.
[00:34:26] I'm on the board of directors from Pointe Park neighbors.
[00:34:29] I'm on the real estate development partners committee
[00:34:32] for the uptown Chamber of Commerce.
[00:34:34] I'm on the board for the uptown Chicago commission.
[00:34:39] Look at it.
[00:34:39] And then I actually, here's what happened.
[00:34:42] One of the things that put me on the map
[00:34:43] for that neighborhood early on back in 2018,
[00:34:46] I was walking out Hutchins and Street one day
[00:34:48] and I saw all these homes that were for sale
[00:34:50] and it drove me nuts.
[00:34:51] I didn't have the listing on any of them,
[00:34:53] but I thought to myself, you know what?
[00:34:55] I can find a buyer.
[00:34:56] So what I did, I researched, you know,
[00:34:58] historic preservation groups in Chicago
[00:35:00] and landmarks Illinois came up.
[00:35:03] And landmarks Illinois, I reached out to them
[00:35:05] because this is what I used to do in Quad Cities.
[00:35:07] Every time I had an old mansion listed,
[00:35:08] I called this Got County Struct Preservation Society,
[00:35:11] did a private open house for them, brought their members in
[00:35:14] and I sold one or two of my listings from that
[00:35:16] and I got listings from it too.
[00:35:19] So I called landmarks Illinois and I said,
[00:35:21] hey, you don't know who I am.
[00:35:23] I'm a young real estate agent.
[00:35:24] I live in Pointe Park.
[00:35:25] There's a bunch of really cool mansions for sale
[00:35:27] on the Hutchins and Street Historic District.
[00:35:30] If I organized a tour for your highest donors,
[00:35:33] would that be of interest to you?
[00:35:36] Because these are people that have money
[00:35:37] that understand historic preservation.
[00:35:39] And they said, absolutely, we don't know who you are,
[00:35:41] so we need to sniff you out first.
[00:35:44] But if you can organize that, yeah, we're totally,
[00:35:47] we're always looking for ways to get in front of our top donors.
[00:35:50] So I reached out to all the listing agents
[00:35:52] that had listings on the street.
[00:35:54] Every single one of them said yes.
[00:35:57] And I, so I said, okay, this day, this time,
[00:36:01] you got, I just need you listing agents
[00:36:03] to open up your property.
[00:36:04] I already have all the history on your house
[00:36:06] because I've done the research,
[00:36:07] I give tours from the neighborhood already.
[00:36:09] And then I'm gonna bring all the people.
[00:36:11] So then I reached out to the Alderman's office,
[00:36:12] which was James Kaplanman at the time.
[00:36:14] And I called his trece affair,
[00:36:17] who was the chief of staff.
[00:36:19] I said, hey, I'm doing a private tour invite only
[00:36:23] on Hutchins and Street for the Homes at a For Sale.
[00:36:26] I'm inviting landmarks, Illinois.
[00:36:28] Does the Alderman want FaceTime on this group?
[00:36:30] Because he can certainly come and join.
[00:36:32] She said, absolutely.
[00:36:33] I got to attend to 15 people that would show up to this tour.
[00:36:37] I had 41 people show up to this tour.
[00:36:41] And so I gave my very high spirited tour,
[00:36:45] like I normally do.
[00:36:46] The Alderman showed up, well, I'd gotten to know
[00:36:49] one of the neighbors on Kaplan Avenue.
[00:36:52] He was a developer and he had a really cool backyard.
[00:36:56] And I, and the reservoir, which is a restaurant
[00:36:58] in the neighborhood, I called,
[00:37:00] there's a lender that I brought in that does construction
[00:37:03] loans and financing for rehab projects.
[00:37:06] So I called him, he sponsored dinner and cocktails,
[00:37:11] you know, brought in from reservoir.
[00:37:13] And reservoir came and catered it at this developer's house
[00:37:16] because I needed a cool place to have a cocktail hour
[00:37:18] at the end of the tour.
[00:37:20] The tour went off without a hitch.
[00:37:23] One of the properties on the tour did sell because of the tour.
[00:37:27] I was in a bubble, but it did sell.
[00:37:29] And after that, I had all of those residents
[00:37:32] who found out about the tour and how successful it was,
[00:37:35] they started calling me.
[00:37:37] And they started printing our agent,
[00:37:39] didn't sell the property.
[00:37:41] If you want to bring a buyer,
[00:37:42] we'll pay you, you know, a bonus or whatever.
[00:37:45] And then over the years, his properties turned over.
[00:37:49] I got to know the neighbors.
[00:37:50] And then I started, then during the pandemic,
[00:37:52] because I got to know so many of them,
[00:37:54] they're in my database.
[00:37:55] And I thought to myself, well, I have a database.
[00:37:58] I could just export this list of contacts
[00:38:01] and do an Excel spreadsheet and voila.
[00:38:04] Now I have a neighborhood roster
[00:38:06] that I can share with the neighbors.
[00:38:08] They ate it up.
[00:38:10] And because everybody, you know, in summer of 2020,
[00:38:12] when everybody was born, had nothing to do,
[00:38:15] we started doing what are called block tales,
[00:38:17] where everybody on the block got together
[00:38:20] every Friday, 537, 30, and BYOB, bring a mask.
[00:38:24] And we just got, you know, drunk in someone's front porch,
[00:38:29] backyard patio, their driveway, whatever.
[00:38:31] And of course, that was the only REALTOR there.
[00:38:34] And from there on out, you know,
[00:38:36] it's rare when I don't get called for a listing on the street.
[00:38:39] And if I don't get the listing,
[00:38:41] I was definitely competing for it.
[00:38:43] And then I've had some sellers that have called
[00:38:45] and said, hey, we're listing with our friend.
[00:38:47] We totally would have listed with you,
[00:38:49] but we wanted to tell you first before it went on the market.
[00:38:52] And by the way, that's like the greatest compliment,
[00:38:55] even though it didn't fall your way,
[00:38:56] you get it, it makes sense.
[00:38:57] And I've gotten probably four of those calls.
[00:39:02] And just this past month, I closed two of my Hutchinson.
[00:39:05] So it's, you know, I truly built my castle
[00:39:10] and built a mode around it.
[00:39:12] And I'm the fire breathing dragon of my castle,
[00:39:15] but it's, but it's blood over in other neighborhoods.
[00:39:17] And now I'm getting calls from buyers
[00:39:19] who are saying, hey, we want to be in this neighborhood.
[00:39:21] But what do you have coming?
[00:39:24] So, and I did the same thing in the Quad Cities,
[00:39:26] and it worked.
[00:39:27] You know, that was, I found an underserved market,
[00:39:30] met the need of the people that lived there
[00:39:32] and just became the face of it.
[00:39:34] And it's not, and it wasn't,
[00:39:36] and this is an area that really wanted community.
[00:39:40] And actually backing up a little bit,
[00:39:42] when I started doing my initial campus thing,
[00:39:44] I did it door to door.
[00:39:45] I knocked on everyone's doors.
[00:39:47] I went down Hutchinson and I started asking people,
[00:39:50] I have a new agent in the neighborhood.
[00:39:52] What do you want to, what, you know,
[00:39:59] trying to learn more about the community
[00:40:01] and everything, not one person slam the door in my face.
[00:40:05] Everybody had a story to tell.
[00:40:07] And I told them, I just had a couple questions.
[00:40:09] Not one person spent less than 45 minutes with me.
[00:40:12] I, one person I spent two hours with,
[00:40:14] and they started introducing me to the other neighbors.
[00:40:17] Right.
[00:40:17] And I just asked them, how long you've been here,
[00:40:20] where you lived here before,
[00:40:21] what do you like the most about living here?
[00:40:23] And what I heard from one woman, Bebeck Glazer,
[00:40:27] she was in her 80s and she said, you know,
[00:40:29] I've been here since 1965,
[00:40:31] and when people started putting their gates up,
[00:40:34] I feel like the gates divided us.
[00:40:36] I was like, really?
[00:40:37] And I kept hearing over and over again,
[00:40:39] people wanted connection.
[00:40:40] They wanted to know their neighbors.
[00:40:42] There was one person I knew that lived in their house
[00:40:43] for 20 years and they had never met the person
[00:40:45] across the street from them.
[00:40:47] And so I brought this to one of the other neighbors
[00:40:49] and I said, hey, we've got a need here.
[00:40:52] All that, I'm keeping hearing this over and over again.
[00:40:54] People want to get together
[00:40:55] and I've got all their contact information now.
[00:40:57] And he's like, I'll make a phone call.
[00:41:00] So we call Vicki down the street
[00:41:01] who's got this massive property.
[00:41:03] You know, it's actually on the market right now
[00:41:04] so Zanna Genela has elisted.
[00:41:08] 76 single family homes in the neighborhood.
[00:41:11] So we threw, we sent out invitations to everybody.
[00:41:16] We were throwing a black party at Vicki's house.
[00:41:19] She got this massive yard.
[00:41:21] Come on out.
[00:41:22] And if you live in the neighborhood, come on out.
[00:41:26] Of the 76 single family homes, 58 of them showed up.
[00:41:31] That's incredible.
[00:41:32] That was incredible.
[00:41:33] And Jonathan, God bless him.
[00:41:36] He had a sign in table.
[00:41:37] Everybody had to sign in.
[00:41:38] Everybody had to get their badge
[00:41:39] and with their name and their address and where they lived.
[00:41:42] And Jonathan let me work the sign in.
[00:41:43] And then we got the sign in table.
[00:41:45] So that's the key, that's the key table.
[00:41:47] That was how I got to know everybody.
[00:41:49] And plus they saw my name
[00:41:51] and I had been sending out mail once a month.
[00:41:53] I said not a letter once a month.
[00:41:54] Here's some market updates
[00:41:55] and here's what's going on in your neighborhood.
[00:41:57] So people saw my name like,
[00:41:58] oh, you're the one that's been sending me
[00:41:59] those market reports and that was it.
[00:42:02] So that was how it all got started.
[00:42:05] Well, that is an incredible story.
[00:42:08] And I'm just digesting it myself.
[00:42:10] But what I was thinking of is what were
[00:42:12] the sort of crucial elements of what you did there.
[00:42:16] And I, a couple of things stuck out to me.
[00:42:18] I mean, aside from just the brilliance of reaching out
[00:42:22] to the landmark organization.
[00:42:24] And but really what you did was something
[00:42:27] that really anybody could do is get immersed
[00:42:29] in a particular community and find out,
[00:42:32] talk to the residents, find out what they need,
[00:42:35] find out what's not happening that they wish were to happen
[00:42:37] and then come up with solutions.
[00:42:41] And you're so right.
[00:42:42] I mean, look, I mean, how many REALTORS
[00:42:45] who have tried to penetrate that particular market
[00:42:48] ever thought to ask the residents, hey,
[00:42:51] what if you were to change something,
[00:42:54] what could be changed?
[00:42:55] Or what would you like to see different?
[00:42:57] You don't usually hear REALTORS talking about that.
[00:42:59] They might say, hey, how long have you lived here,
[00:43:00] when you're thinking moving?
[00:43:02] And the traditional sales kind of stuff.
[00:43:04] But you didn't approach it from that at all.
[00:43:06] You're like, I want to have all the knowledge of this area.
[00:43:08] So I can be a tour guide and I can also be of service
[00:43:11] to the residents.
[00:43:12] And you just kept going from there.
[00:43:14] And it was all about being of service.
[00:43:17] And that obviously you look, you're on all of these boards
[00:43:19] and committees.
[00:43:20] And we should also mention too.
[00:43:22] I know this may have gotten lost in all of the things
[00:43:24] I was talking about, all the accolades you've accomplished.
[00:43:28] But Alex is a 30 under 30 NAR
[00:43:31] National Association REALTORS Honorary.
[00:43:33] That is a very big deal.
[00:43:35] And so what the National Association REALTORS does
[00:43:38] every year is they take a look at the thousands
[00:43:40] and thousands of agents, oh gosh, probably tens of thousands
[00:43:44] of agents who are under 30, maybe even 100,000 or more.
[00:43:47] And they look at people who are doing exceptional things.
[00:43:51] So that's a huge accolade and a huge thing under your belt.
[00:43:55] But I love the ideas you just seem like you
[00:43:57] want to build community.
[00:43:59] And I think that that is boy, what a smart, what a smart
[00:44:04] and also fulfilling thing.
[00:44:06] And it's fun.
[00:44:07] I imagine it's all fun.
[00:44:08] It's a fun business.
[00:44:10] It's a people ask you, I've been to all the time,
[00:44:12] like, bye, you've got all these cool listings.
[00:44:13] You've always got this unique stuff.
[00:44:15] And it's not only getting to represent those properties,
[00:44:19] it's getting to sell them too.
[00:44:20] I mean, it's fun getting to tell their story.
[00:44:23] And I always, so the other part is of how I built my business.
[00:44:26] So you mentioned fostering the community.
[00:44:28] But then I had a bunch of resources
[00:44:29] because sitting on all those boards gives me
[00:44:31] incredible access to information.
[00:44:33] And also because I'm now on the, so landmarks Illinois
[00:44:36] came back to me a year and a half later
[00:44:38] and asked me to be on the board of landmarks.
[00:44:40] Yeah, I imagine they would.
[00:44:42] They, and I'm still the youngest serving board member.
[00:44:44] I've been on for four years now.
[00:44:45] I'm still the youngest serving one.
[00:44:47] But they, so I have tremendous opportunities there
[00:44:51] for property, for homeowners that have a landmark property.
[00:44:55] So I've got a lot of information there.
[00:44:56] But the third piece of this is the, I mentioned earlier,
[00:45:01] whenever these are not easy properties to sell.
[00:45:03] And they are not the ones you put on the market
[00:45:05] got multiple offers.
[00:45:06] These are ones that sit for a while.
[00:45:09] Even in this market, they still sit.
[00:45:13] And I've done the craziest, most outlandish,
[00:45:18] absurd stuff to sell these properties.
[00:45:21] I had a mansion listed on Anster Street
[00:45:23] where, I'm filling, I had that co-listed actually
[00:45:26] where we put that one up for auction.
[00:45:28] That was in the middle of the pandemic in the summer of 2020.
[00:45:33] I had Brian Erlocker's house listed
[00:45:36] and we marketed that as a summer escape
[00:45:39] from the city of Furnish rental.
[00:45:41] Finally sold that to somebody that tore it down
[00:45:44] because they wanted the land.
[00:45:47] I've sold properties that are, you know,
[00:45:49] funky earth berm homes.
[00:45:51] I've sold, you know,
[00:45:53] they're just really out of the box ways of selling it.
[00:45:55] So not only is it getting in the door of these properties,
[00:45:58] it's having the resources to help them
[00:46:00] and be out of the box creativity to sell them.
[00:46:04] It's a three prong approach that, you know,
[00:46:07] for me, I would so much rather have a difficult listing
[00:46:10] than another two bed, two bed con, no one liked you.
[00:46:13] Like, that's nice, it pays the bills
[00:46:15] but it doesn't get me out of bed in the morning.
[00:46:17] 
[00:46:18] Yeah, you like a challenge.
[00:46:20] I do.
[00:46:21] I do.
[00:46:21] And it's fulfilling because what the challenge,
[00:46:25] you know, really activates within you as I see it is creativity.
[00:46:28] All of a sudden, you're creative sparks.
[00:46:30] You know, Lakeview is a very popular neighborhood here
[00:46:34] in Chicago for those who aren't familiar
[00:46:35] and it's great neighborhood, lovely neighborhood, wonderful,
[00:46:38] not difficult to sell.
[00:46:40] Maybe difficult to get market share
[00:46:42] but if you get a listing there, it's probably going to sell.
[00:46:44] And it's going to sell pretty easily
[00:46:46] because it's so desirable.
[00:46:47] Point apart is less known
[00:46:49] and not less desirable for certain types of people,
[00:46:53] more desirable for others.
[00:46:55] But again, I love that you went to the part
[00:46:57] that like, I've never heard anybody in Chicago
[00:47:00] I want to be the boy in a park guy.
[00:47:02] No, I'm sure there are people that do
[00:47:04] but 90% of the people I hear who are working the city
[00:47:07] are like, I want to be the Lincoln Park guy,
[00:47:08] I want to be the Green North guy.
[00:47:09] These are the sort of glitzy, fun areas, gold coast, et cetera.
[00:47:13] And I love that you went the other way
[00:47:14] because and the reason why you did is you did the research
[00:47:17] and you go, there's a lot of opportunity here
[00:47:19] and it sort of meets my needs.
[00:47:21] I kind of like these funky homes.
[00:47:23] And now I got to figure out how to connect with the community
[00:47:26] and you did what, what an incredible story.
[00:47:29] And I know there's so much more to talk about
[00:47:31] but I think this is a great place to wrap up.
[00:47:33] I'm going to give a recommendation to our audience.
[00:47:35] I want you, if you can, if you were so inspired by Alex's story
[00:47:39] here about how he penetrated this community,
[00:47:42] I want you to go back and listen to the steps that he took
[00:47:45] because I really wanted to interrupt him every step
[00:47:48] of the way, be like, okay, cool, how'd you do that?
[00:47:50] And I didn't want to interrupt his flow
[00:47:51] but I want you guys to listen to it again
[00:47:53] because you will pick up exactly his thought process,
[00:47:56] how he did it.
[00:47:58] And boy, please go out and do what he did.
[00:48:00] You will have, if nothing else,
[00:48:02] you will have a really enjoyable career
[00:48:04] and you will have probably a very successful one as well.
[00:48:08] I also would like to mention that if you are a REALTOR
[00:48:11] in the Chicago land area and maybe you feel
[00:48:13] you're not getting the attention you need
[00:48:15] at your current firm or you're looking,
[00:48:17] this is the year where the market is down.
[00:48:19] People are looking to maybe switch firms,
[00:48:21] check out other teams, Alex's team is growing.
[00:48:24] So if you think you could be an asset to him
[00:48:27] or if you'd like to learn from him
[00:48:29] and you think you might be a good fit, reach out to him,
[00:48:31] you can find him on his website,
[00:48:32] altswolking.com, as well as Instagram
[00:48:35] and all the other social platforms he's on.
[00:48:37] So reach out to him if you think he might be a good fit.
[00:48:39] I know I would want to work with him if I was practicing
[00:48:41] so definitely reach out.
[00:48:43] I am so impressed.
[00:48:45] And also for everyone else who doesn't live in Chicago,
[00:48:48] you might have clients that move to Chicago
[00:48:51] and one of the coolest things about doing this show.
[00:48:54] I wish I could participate in the financial part of it,
[00:48:57] but even so it's so rewarding that almost every time
[00:49:01] we do an episode for anywhere in the country,
[00:49:03] that person ends up calling us later and goes,
[00:49:05] I just got a listing from one of your listeners
[00:49:07] who has somebody who's coming in to buy yourself.
[00:49:10] And so please, if you are looking for a Chicago agent
[00:49:13] just to even partner up with,
[00:49:15] boy, Alex would be a good one to partner up with.
[00:49:17] So reach out to him if, and by the way,
[00:49:20] Alex has people that leave Chicago too
[00:49:22] and he needs to refer business to other places.
[00:49:24] So maybe he doesn't have somebody in your market
[00:49:27] that he could be the referral to you for.
[00:49:30] So reach out to him.
[00:49:31] He's a wonderful guy and certainly doing all of the right things
[00:49:35] and somebody certainly to follow on social as well
[00:49:38] to see how he's marketing himself
[00:49:40] and he's not a really big social guy,
[00:49:42] but when he does his social stuff,
[00:49:44] it's actually really, really impressive and excellent.
[00:49:46] So anyway, everyone check out Alex,
[00:49:48] AlexWolking.com, link to all of his stuff in the show notes.
[00:49:52] And on behalf of the audience, Alex,
[00:49:54] thank you so much for being on our show.

[00:50:27] that needs some encouragement right now.
[00:50:29] Maybe their business is down.
[00:50:31] Guess what, almost everyone's business is down.
[00:50:32] This is a time to share information,

But let's get to the main event, my conversation with Alex Wolking. Okay, today on the show, our guest is Alex Wolking with color Williams, one here in Chicago. And let me tell you more about Alex. He is a second generation broker and real estate was all he is and is all he is ever known at 12 years old. He began working for his father, who's a real estate veteran in the Quad Cities region of Illinois and Iowa. And 2011 at 19 years old, Wolking earned his Iowa real estate license and was awarded rookie of the year in 2012. Amazing. Wolking's small town roots taught him the importance of building strong relationships while maintaining discretion and while approaching negotiations with discernment. Wolking spent time away from Chicago after graduating from DePaul, which is here in Chicago. Before returning to Chicago in 2016, probably rebuilding his referral based network from scratch, Wolking has since received numerous accolades, including recognition as a top producer by the Chicago Association of REALTORS since 2019. A 2021 national association of REALTORS 30 under 30 on a re and regarded by real trends as a top 1.5% agent in America on the real trends 1000 list for 2022. Please, everyone check out Alex on his website Alex Wolking.com. It's A-L-E-X-W-O-L-K-I-N-G. .com link for that in the show notes and follow him on Instagram. Alex at Alex Wolking, we will have a link to that in the show notes as well. Alex, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me, DJ. Good to finally meet you. I am. Yeah, I am super excited to meet you. Alex is a little bit of a celebrity here in the Chicago real estate. I would say a rising star, but I feel like your star is already risen, but it's still continuing to rise. And I am so excited to get to talk to you because I'm always, to me, it's always impressive when people who are younger and you have, gosh, you started so, so young, you know, we're able to find success so, so quickly. And I know it's through tremendous, tremendous hard work, but we would love to hear a little bit of your story. So let's go back to the beginning. Tell us how you got into real estate. Yeah, so when I was 12, my, I'll never forget, I always tell the story. My dad, as you know, was a real estate broker in the Quad Cities, and actually back in March of this year, it was his 30th year in business. And I was 12, he called me and he was like, hey, I need you to log into this website and print this thing out for me. Well, it was the MLS and he wanted a listing sheet printed out because he was driving by on his way to a showing. I didn't know what he did, but I was so fascinated by the system. I started diving through it and I just thought it was so cool. And then later that week, he went to go meet with a single mom first time home buyer. She had two daughters that were about my age. And again, I had never seen what my dad did for a living. And we went to this house and he went across the street. There was a Wendy's across the street. And we're sitting there. And actually, the listing sheet that I printed was for this house. And I saw, we sat down and my dad just became this other person that was so cool. I saw him, like this woman was so nervous and scared. And her two daughters were about me and my brother's age. And so we're sitting there eating our burgers or whatever. And watching my dad help this woman navigate buying a house and putting her at ease. And then later, hearing the phone call of when he called and said you got the house. And you could hear her like scream with excitement over the phone. That was when I saw the whole arc of what my dad did. And I thought it was the coolest thing ever. And so I just became obsessed. And I was so obsessed that at 12 years old, I got on my bike and went to open houses because my mom wouldn't take me. I just wanted to help dad out. I thought it was the coolest thing. I wanted to help him do more of that. So I started doing going to open houses on my bike to learn the market and help him out. I went to, you know, when I turned 16, I went to 229 open houses that year. I got to know the whole real estate community and other agents would call my dad and be like, your son came through my open house today. He took some of the cookies. I did. So they, but you know what, help those I would go on other agents. There were some ages I would make a point to go to their open houses because I would hear how they would talk to clients that came through. I would hear how they worked. I could test out who's a good agent who wasn't. And I could, there were some agents I would just go and they liked me so much that sometimes I would just go sit their open houses with them and just watch them work and listen to them. And that's so I got, you know, by the time I was 19, I got licensed. I have already graduated real estate high school. That is, that is an incredible story. And you know, we've done about 500 episodes and that is one of the more unique stories that I have heard. I love it. And it's a good reminder for everyone listening that open houses are the way. They are the way. I was joking. I mean, I was taught the old school way, DJ. I mean, I, you know, so many agents today that get into the business are taught social media and marketing yourself in video. I learned the old school old fashioned way. I've all, I've all bellied a bellied toe to toe. And I was, you know, open houses door knocking. I mean, the handwritten notes. We had such a small town Midwest thing. And that's really ultimately what I still built my business and have accredited a lot of my success to today. And I had great teachers too. I had great teachers growing up. Yeah. My dad never, I have to say this, my dad never ran real estate down my throat. I think a lot of real estate just want their kids to get into the business, to want their spouse to get in. He always let me discover on my own and he never pushed it. I think that's part of the reason I liked it so much because it was never forced on me. Well, you got your license at 19. So you were in college, I guess at that time. Andy were in college here in Chicago and you got your license in India, I'm sorry, in Iowa, which is not super convenient. But so tell us about that. Yeah. So I went to, I went, I did not have the traditional college career. I got licensed halfway through my freshman year and I got, so I went home on weekends. I went home every summer. I went home on spring break. I went home for a holiday break because, you know, DePaul's off from Thanksgiving New Year's. I went home that whole time. I didn't have my first Chicago summer until I moved back in 2016 or 2017, really. Because I just wanted to work, but by the time I graduated, I had already had a book of business and clients I was working with. So I graduated from DePaul and I moved back home to Quad Cities the next day. And I graduated from the reason I went to DePaul in the first place was because they had in their college of commerce, they actually had a degree in real estate. And that was what my training was in. It was more commercial focus, finance, development, you know, that sort of thing. And nothing to do with brokerage or sales, but I could go sell commercial real estate tomorrow if I wanted to, but I don't want to. You know, people sell commercial I have the utmost respect for because it seems just like, I don't think I've this stomach to do it. It's a, it's a lot, a lot of stress. But, but anyway, so what's so amazing about your story is, is you would think, you know, hey, dad's got this incredible business back home. He's, he's established, he's respected. I have my license. Maybe I partner up with dad or maybe I build my own brand there, but certainly the name is, is a name people may know. And so that would obviously be a huge leg up. You've already sat hundreds of open houses. You know the good REALTORS. You've already established yourself and you have a book of business there. So you would assume that that's where you ended up. But you didn't and you decided to come here and, and I want to make sure that people know that even though Alex said, hey, during college, when to schooled Chicago, he would go home on the weekends. It's not like we're that close to the Quad Cities. It's what at least two hours, maybe. So I have to three hours. Yeah. So I grew up in Puri, Illinois, about three hours away from Chicago as well. And the, I didn't go to school in Puri, but the idea of traveling like that on the weekends would have just driven me nuts. But regardless, you were really set up to build your business in Iowa or, or, you're right on the Quad Cities, which is Iowa and Illinois, but not Chicago at all. And then you were like, I'm going to come back to Chicago and you had to start completely over. So how did you do that? So this is where one Mr. Phil Buyers comes into play. So, Phil Buyers, who is now with Compass. When I was 18 years old, my dad was a teen leader of the Quad Cities office and Kelle Wynne's Quad Cities office. And the, and so I was moving up here to go to Paul. And my dad reached out to Phil, who was the teen leader at the time. And he said, you know, I've got this son. He's going to Paul. He loves real estate yet. Anything for him to do. And Phil's like, yeah, I'm sure we can find something for him to do. And my dad's like, Alex is, um, Alex is, uh, he's a neat kid. He's up the phone. And that Phil will tell you that story like it was yesterday. And so I come barreling in the Phil's office. I had an hour long meeting with him. And he, he just looked to me and he's like, I will help you do it every want to do. So when I went at the end of 2015, I was 23 years old. I was number three in the Quad Cities office. And I was at the top 50 agents on the border eliters there. And I had helped ring to my dad that year. Which I'm sure he was both proud of and disappointed by. But at the end of 2015, you know, I did really well. And I had built up a book of business of just unique homes. That was my niche was hard to sell stuff. And, but I knew it is a 23 year old single gay man. The Quad Cities was not the place for me. Oh, that is all of our phones are going off right now. It's the, this is the second time ever that they are testing. I learned about this the other day, the emergency broadcast system. So that's what you might have just heard. Mine will be coming in the next few seconds. So I will deal with that. So Alex has just got it. But no big deal. We will, we will cut that out. So anyway, as a young 23 year old single gay man, I knew that the Quad Cities, especially after I had been there, it was not the place for me to be at that time of my life anyway. And I knew, especially after having lived in Chicago, I mean, the greatest cities actually just voted one of the best cities in America for the seventh year in a row. I knew that I wanted more for myself. And I knew I would regret it if I didn't move back to Chicago. So I was terrified. And I worked for Phil in college. I was an intern on his team when he was at properties at the time. So I went back and he had the other my internship. He said, well, you know, if you ever decide to come back, your job will always be here. And I was like, okay, great. So I filed that away. Cut to January of 2020 or 2016, I messaged him late on a Thursday night and I said, Hey, I'm thinking about coming back Chicago. Can I talk to you about taking my old job back on buyer's home team? Any and I was coming up to, I wasn't planning coming up to the city that weekend, but he said Saturday morning, 9 am my office, bring coffee. And I was like, okay, so I got my car and I drove up, you know, Friday night. I walked into his office at Saturday morning and he's like, so you want to come back Chicago? I said, yeah, I want to come back Chicago. Can I come work as a buyer's agent for you on buyer's home team? And he's like, what? No, you'll be fine on your own. You see that empty desk across the hallway? Sit your ass over there. You'll be just fine without me. You don't need a team. You don't need me. You don't need anybody else. You will be fine on your own. Just get your ass here. It was like, oh, okay. He's like, when's your slowest time there? I was like, right around September. He's like, great. Start telling everybody that you know that you're moving to Chicago on September. Figure out the plan later, but just tell everybody that you're moving. Okay, I was at that time, I was 24. And so I started telling people, I'm moving back to Chicago. And people were like, what? And I was like, I don't know, I'm gonna figure it out. So, while we hold, I signed at least September 1st of 2016. And I came back and then I transitioned my business for about two years of 2017, 2018. I partnered with an agent of the Quad Cities to kind of take over my business there. And then, so I still was like part time here my first two years, but I didn't go full time here until January 1st of 2019. Wow. And how did you build the business here when you had such a strong foot hold there? I'm sure there may be a little bit of overlap, maybe people moving, but usually people, the Quad Cities stay in the Quad Cities, same with Puri or I'm from. So it's not like, oh, this is an easy transition. No, it's, you were literally starting over. So how did you do it? Oh, man. You know, DJ, I'm still figuring that out too. I think, you know, I've just always been born with the gift of unbridled tenacity. And I've never, you know, there's not a conversation I've straight away from, there's not a, you know, I have no problem picking up a phone. But what really did it when I first came back, I mean, teller Williams came in really handy as an international brand. Because for years, I'd gone to all the conferences, I had made a bunch of friends and built relationships with other ages around the country. They didn't know anybody in Davenport, Iowa or Molina, Illinois. But when I moved to Chicago, I made the big announcement, everybody knew somebody in Chicago. So my first four years, 70% of my business was age of referrals. And that was, that was a huge part of my business. Yeah, I've been to about 2020, 2021 really. And then it just, of course, then it snowed, right? I mean, you got, I sent out just sold postcards around every property I sold. Like my first year here in 2017, I closed 10 properties for like 2.7 million. And then in 2018, I did 13 units for like five million. And then in 2019, I sold 28 homes for 15 million. So just it snowed all, literally doubled year over year. And then I hired Kevin, my assistant, my director of operations now. And then from 2020, we went from 28 closed units and 15 and a half million to 52 units for 26 million. So it's just, I mean, that's kind of where I've hovered the last two years is around that $25, $30 million mark. And it's, you know, that's, you know, as they say, take the leap of faith and trust in that will catch you. And it sure did. Yeah, it's, it's so funny because you, you know, you in your early, in your teen years really did a lot of the heavy lifting that people even when they get their license, oftentimes don't do. And look, I mean, you know, it's, it's never too late to get in shape. It's never too late to start building skills. It's never too late for, for anything in life if you put the effort in and you had obviously, you probably saw, I'm sure your father worked extremely hard as an a successful agent, every successful agent does. And so you saw his work ethic and then you were able to also participate without really being in the industry for, for some time. And boy, you, you know, it reminds me of a story. So here in Chicago, one of the top agents, we, and by the way, Alex is mentioning Phil Buyers. We have an episode we've done with Phil Buyers. He is an exceptional person to listen to. He's, he's trained and coached numerous agents. He's with Compass. You can go back through our archives and find Phil's episode. It's, he's just such a wonderful human, one of one of my favorite people. And I was thinking about another episode that I've done here in Chicago that your story reminded me of. So for people in Chicago who are listening, you'll know this name, but everyone else might not. His name's Matt Larassese, one of the big producers, one of the biggest actually of about 46,000 agents in Chicago. And he's one or two or three, and he's always at the top. And what, when I had him on the show millions of years ago, he, he told me that his first five years in the business, I think he only sold, I can't remember exactly 12 homes total in five years. And I said, he did and he goes, well, I was living at home, so I didn't have to pay for rent. And he goes, but I considered it going to college. Like you were saying, by the time you were 19, you're like, I've already put in my, you know, not maybe 10,000 hours, but I put it a lot of hours. And he would just get up every day and walk around River North, which is where he wanted to specialize. And he went to every building and he just learned the inventory. And he goes, you know, I was poor for five years. I made no money. I was a little bit, it was a little embarrassing, but now he's, you know, at the very, very top of the mountain. So it's, you know, you have a similar story there. And I just, I'm so impressed with people that put in that amount of work because it's discipline. And it's not easy. Well, and you know, in addition to that, two DJs, I learned very early on, and I think some of the ages they get success really quickly and they just blow through every dollar they make, where, I mean, my first year in the business was 2011. That was the bottom of the market. Tough, tough, tough year. I didn't sell any, I got licensed April 2011. My first closing was until February 2012. And so I mean, I went a whole year without selling anything and I almost got out of business. And my first listing was actually FSBO that I had converted from Doornock. And my second listing was a short sale. And that was, I mean, I got in a very difficult market. So I've always been very cautious with how I spent my money by marketing dollars and how I, you know, where referrals come from. So like in markets like this year that have been challenging, a lot of agents are freaked out and scrambling, I'm not. Cause that I've been through that. And I watched my dad go through 2007 through 2010. And I, you know, I watched, you know, having grown up and then I've been through market cycles before. And how we would adapt and change in those markets. But what I wanted to say was, right, is I was actually making copies of my license at the copier ready to go. There we go. Okay. I was actually, so in December of 2011, I was about to drop my license. I was gonna go hang it. I was making copies of my license. I was going to the Quads New York Real Church for Association to turn it in. I had an appointment and everything. And the number one agent in the office at the time, I'm Deb Hausman. She saw what I was doing. She's like, what are you doing? I was like, I'm hanging my license. She's like, you're not gonna be in real estate anymore? And I was like, yeah, I think I'm just gonna finish my degree and I'll get in real estate after that. She's like, really? So she's like, I think you should give that some time. Like give it a few days. Let's don't do it today. I was like, all right. So I canceled my appointment. I went to dinner with my mom and I got a ping on my phone back in the day when I had a blackberry and I had a, I got an email from her. And this was, by this point, I was at home and it was probably like 11 o'clock at night, which is unlike Deb. She's missed, I'm in bed by 8.30 every night. It was an email from her saying, I couldn't sleep thinking about you getting out of the business. If it's not hard, it's not worth having. You need to go network more. And I was like, networking, what's networking? She's like, Alex, go make friends. And I was like, she's like, you need to go make friends. So I'm a business today because of Deb Hausman and I built my business on her advice. Best advice I ever got in the industry was go make friends. That if I write a book someday about all my successes and adventures and my memoirs, the name of the book is gonna be called go make friends. You know, you're absolutely so right on. You know, we are wired for community, we're wired for connection, we want to support our friends, we want to help them with their endeavors. We oftentimes use our friends in a negative way, but we utilize our friends to, hey, who's your doctor? Who's your hairstylist? Who's your accountant? And who's your REALTOR? And so it is, you know, being likable is such an important and I don't mean changing who you are to fit someone else's needs. I just mean being somebody who's approachable, somebody who, whether you're introverted, extroverted, you can learn skills to, you know, be a likable person. And I always think that being likable is one of the key tenants of being in real estate. It's being somebody that can, people can talk to and they can bring their challenges and their stress and all of the ups and downs of a transaction. I mean, it is, every transaction stressful at some point, sometimes many times during it and the clients are stressing out just like, you know, you would expect and being somebody that they can come to and you're making this massive decision with, you know, financially and you get to be the one who's really guiding them is really, it's almost, you know, blessing may be a little bit of a strong word, but it's really, we're very fortunate to be in this kind of profession where we're literally guiding somebody through one of the more stressful parts of life is buying and selling homes. Yes, yes. And that advice of go make friends was literally how I, I've always approached my business and not only that, that was the mindset, the mentality I had when I moved back here to Chicago and just started over again was, I don't have to go make friends. And that was it. It's just incredible that you've built basically two businesses before the age of 30 in two different locations, basically starting from scratch. Maybe you could argue in the Quad Cities, maybe you had some additional resources there, but you still put in the work, you still rode your bike to all of those open houses. What do you say to agents today who are starting out who maybe don't have the guidance that you were fortunate enough to have from your father and from Deb, once you got started and obviously Keller Williams, one Chicago here is a really, really well respected brand here locally, obviously internationally too, but you have a lot of great people at your firm and also people at Compass Filifiers. A lot of people are in your corner, but you asked, you went out and made those connections yourself. But let's talk, I want to talk about open houses just for a moment because I think it is, you were saying social media wasn't really the main driver for your business, but making friends and also sitting hundreds of open houses is really like, can you talk a little bit about what skills you learned by watching other REALTORS do that? Oh my God, so I don't know where to begin with that, because I'm an observer. I've always been a lifelong learner, I love being a student and a lot of what I learned was what to do and what not to do. You watch how a lot, if anything, I wasn't necessarily watching the agent, I was watching the buyers and the consumers coming through and what their reactions were to what the agent was saying or doing. And what I found doing that is that people like the element of surprise. And I think one of the biggest things I took away was never rob a buyer from the element of the business. I love surprise. Instead of saying, this kitchen has an amazing pantry, let them discover that, let them go and find that. When it came to converting, it was like just having a normal conversation with people, just ask them, oh you guys, where do you guys go to brunch today? And if you've been to this place around corner, there's just so many things like that of just being real, just being real with people. And then it's so easy to say, oh well, be yourself. Let's hard to do what you don't know who you are. But there's a, I think that was the way I saw the greatest response from consumers at open houses was when agents were real and relatable. And it instantly takes the guard down for a lot of consumers. So I mean, I used to dress up for open houses and I'd wear the suit and tie and brown shoes and all of that. And I what I found was that my conversion went up when I ditched the suit. Interesting. And Mr. Laracy will have you believing otherwise. But anyway, that's authentically him too. That's not me. And I also had to look at what markets I was serving. The Quad Cities is a very kind of blue collar area. And I always was more drawn to areas that just felt real. So for me, the vast majority of my business is late view uptown, edgewater, Ravenswood, Lincoln Square. I don't do, I sold in 2022, I sold 51 homes and only two of them were in Lincoln Park and both of them were in the same building. So it wasn't, that's just not my vibe. It's not my energy. I just love where I can be real. And the fact that, I mean, if I went to a $2 million listing appointment in Ravenswood and I showed up on a blue suit and brown shoes they throw me off the front porch. You know, they were you. Did you come from downtown? Like, do you work this neighborhood? That's, I had to find areas and markets that served the vibe and energy that I just liked. And I also had to find how I approach the business as well. For me, I'm brutally honest, like blunt force trauma. I'm a pro people, but I am authentic. And I know to a granular level, my market block by block which that's a level of expertise it takes years to refine. And when I came back to Chicago, I started that whole open house cycle all over again. If I wasn't doing open houses, I was going to open houses. I was going to every broker's open. Some of my greatest mentors in the business have come from that because I kept showing up over and over again. Aside from Phil Buyers, one of my other great mentors has been Millie Rosenblum. Oh, sure. I have a great story about Millie. One of my other biggest mentors has been Marlene Granke with Remix. Do you talk about somebody who knows the market forwards a backward side to side and knows what year the furnace was replaced in a house because she sold it three times. I mean, that woman knows her inventory. That's those are the kinds of agents I learned from growing up. And I see through it here in Chicago, I think a lot of you just want the glamour of the business and the glamour of the listing, but they don't know how to actually do the job. And they don't know how to navigate with ease and finesse. I think that's, you see it so much with the newer agents coming in. But true expertise, that's really missing. And that's something that I valued as a small town real estate agent, you have to have that. I've carried a lot of that small town mentality with me everywhere I've gone. How do you recommend that an agent who is newer to the business start to learn the market? Obviously, some obviously things come to mind. Go to the open houses, go to the broker opens if you're area where you're working has those. You know, obviously, immerse yourself out in the market. But when you're also studying the MLS, like how would you advise somebody to get started so that they can specialize in a particular area? Yeah, that's a great question. So what I did was I took a few small areas that I wanted to work in. And for me, I looked in Wayne Apark. I looked in, I wanted to do single family homes, North of Birmingham Park Road. So I wanted to do Wayne Apark, Grace in West, Ravenswood, Castlewood Terrace, you know, Edgewater Blend, Lakewood, Belmoral. And I took each of those areas in a very granular level. And I went back 10 years. I went back just to see, you know, how many homes turned over every year? What the price appreciation growth was? Who were the agents that were doing most of the deals there? Then I went to their open houses and I learned who they were. And I learned, okay, what makes that agent so unique for this area? The other thing I found too is some agent, is, you know, massive foothold in a market. And a lot of times what you find out is they don't. And they tout themselves the number one agent for the area. And they're, they've done like three deals. But, you know, perception is reality. So a lot of that, I would find, okay, if I'm gonna work in this neighborhood, what's my angle? But what I did in the Quad Cities and what served me extremely well here was, I started to identify markets that had a gaping hole in them where no one was working them, or the agents who were working them were not doing anything to innovate. They had no market share. So I just went after the markets that really weren't underserved. And that's where I started. That was first. And that was how I ended up working in my own neighborhood, my own backyard in Pointe Park, was I looked at all the single family homes on Hutchins the street and junior terrorists and around that little pocket on Casua Terrace. Nobody was working that market. Nobody was. And having come from the Quad Cities and having my knack and my skill set and my eye for selling really weird, funky, unique historic homes, that just fit into an interest of mine and a skill set of mine. So I was like, I'm the perfect agent to fit the role of this neighborhood and then I just started attacking it. I give architecture tours every summer, three times a summer, every summer for the last seven years. I'm on the board of directors from Pointe Park neighbors. I'm on the real estate development partners committee for the uptown Chamber of Commerce. I'm on the board for the uptown Chicago commission. Look at it. And then I actually, here's what happened. One of the things that put me on the map for that neighborhood early on back in 2018, I was walking out Hutchins and Street one day and I saw all these homes that were for sale and it drove me nuts. I didn't have the listing on any of them, but I thought to myself, you know what? I can find a buyer. So what I did, I researched, you know, historic preservation groups in Chicago and landmarks Illinois came up. And landmarks Illinois, I reached out to them because this is what I used to do in Quad Cities. Every time I had an old mansion listed, I called this Got County Struct Preservation Society, did a private open house for them, brought their members in and I sold one or two of my listings from that and I got listings from it too. So I called landmarks Illinois and I said, hey, you don't know who I am. I'm a young real estate agent. I live in Pointe Park. There's a bunch of really cool mansions for sale on the Hutchins and Street Historic District. If I organized a tour for your highest donors, would that be of interest to you? Because these are people that have money that understand historic preservation. And they said, absolutely, we don't know who you are, so we need to sniff you out first. But if you can organize that, yeah, we're totally, we're always looking for ways to get in front of our top donors. So I reached out to all the listing agents that had listings on the street. Every single one of them said yes. And I, so I said, okay, this day, this time, you got, I just need you listing agents to open up your property. I already have all the history on your house because I've done the research, I give tours from the neighborhood already. And then I'm gonna bring all the people. So then I reached out to the Alderman's office, which was James Kaplanman at the time. And I called his trece affair, who was the chief of staff. I said, hey, I'm doing a private tour invite only on Hutchins and Street for the Homes at a For Sale. I'm inviting landmarks, Illinois. Does the Alderman want FaceTime on this group? Because he can certainly come and join. She said, absolutely. I got to attend to 15 people that would show up to this tour. I had 41 people show up to this tour. And so I gave my very high spirited tour, like I normally do. The Alderman showed up, well, I'd gotten to know one of the neighbors on Kaplan Avenue. He was a developer and he had a really cool backyard. And I, and the reservoir, which is a restaurant in the neighborhood, I called, there's a lender that I brought in that does construction loans and financing for rehab projects. So I called him, he sponsored dinner and cocktails, you know, brought in from reservoir. And reservoir came and catered it at this developer's house because I needed a cool place to have a cocktail hour at the end of the tour. The tour went off without a hitch. One of the properties on the tour did sell because of the tour. I was in a bubble, but it did sell. And after that, I had all of those residents who found out about the tour and how successful it was, they started calling me. And they started printing our agent, didn't sell the property. If you want to bring a buyer, we'll pay you, you know, a bonus or whatever. And then over the years, his properties turned over. I got to know the neighbors. And then I started, then during the pandemic, because I got to know so many of them, they're in my database. And I thought to myself, well, I have a database. I could just export this list of contacts and do an Excel spreadsheet and voila. Now I have a neighborhood roster that I can share with the neighbors. They ate it up. And because everybody, you know, in summer of 2020, when everybody was born, had nothing to do, we started doing what are called block tales, where everybody on the block got together every Friday, 537, 30, and BYOB, bring a mask. And we just got, you know, drunk in someone's front porch, backyard patio, their driveway, whatever. And of course, that was the only REALTOR there. And from there on out, you know, it's rare when I don't get called for a listing on the street. And if I don't get the listing, I was definitely competing for it. And then I've had some sellers that have called and said, hey, we're listing with our friend. We totally would have listed with you, but we wanted to tell you first before it went on the market. And by the way, that's like the greatest compliment, even though it didn't fall your way, you get it, it makes sense. And I've gotten probably four of those calls. And just this past month, I closed two of my Hutchinson. So it's, you know, I truly built my castle and built a mode around it. And I'm the fire breathing dragon of my castle, but it's, but it's blood over in other neighborhoods. And now I'm getting calls from buyers who are saying, hey, we want to be in this neighborhood. But what do you have coming? So, and I did the same thing in the Quad Cities, and it worked. You know, that was, I found an underserved market, met the need of the people that lived there and just became the face of it. And it's not, and it wasn't, and this is an area that really wanted community. And actually backing up a little bit, when I started doing my initial campus thing, I did it door to door. I knocked on everyone's doors. I went down Hutchinson and I started asking people, I have a new agent in the neighborhood. What do you want to, what, you know, trying to learn more about the community and everything, not one person slam the door in my face. Everybody had a story to tell. And I told them, I just had a couple questions. Not one person spent less than 45 minutes with me. I, one person I spent two hours with, and they started introducing me to the other neighbors. Right. And I just asked them, how long you've been here, where you lived here before, what do you like the most about living here? And what I heard from one woman, Bebeck Glazer, she was in her 80s and she said, you know, I've been here since 1965, and when people started putting their gates up, I feel like the gates divided us. I was like, really? And I kept hearing over and over again, people wanted connection. They wanted to know their neighbors. There was one person I knew that lived in their house for 20 years and they had never met the person across the street from them. And so I brought this to one of the other neighbors and I said, hey, we've got a need here. All that, I'm keeping hearing this over and over again. People want to get together and I've got all their contact information now. And he's like, I'll make a phone call. So we call Vicki down the street who's got this massive property. You know, it's actually on the market right now so Zanna Genela has elisted. 76 single family homes in the neighborhood. So we threw, we sent out invitations to everybody. We were throwing a black party at Vicki's house. She got this massive yard. Come on out. And if you live in the neighborhood, come on out. Of the 76 single family homes, 58 of them showed up. That's incredible. That was incredible. And Jonathan, God bless him. He had a sign in table. Everybody had to sign in. Everybody had to get their badge and with their name and their address and where they lived. And Jonathan let me work the sign in. And then we got the sign in table. So that's the key, that's the key table. That was how I got to know everybody. And plus they saw my name and I had been sending out mail once a month. I said not a letter once a month. Here's some market updates and here's what's going on in your neighborhood. So people saw my name like, oh, you're the one that's been sending me those market reports and that was it. So that was how it all got started. Well, that is an incredible story. And I'm just digesting it myself. But what I was thinking of is what were the sort of crucial elements of what you did there. And I, a couple of things stuck out to me. I mean, aside from just the brilliance of reaching out to the landmark organization. And but really what you did was something that really anybody could do is get immersed in a particular community and find out, talk to the residents, find out what they need, find out what's not happening that they wish were to happen and then come up with solutions. And you're so right. I mean, look, I mean, how many REALTORS who have tried to penetrate that particular market ever thought to ask the residents, hey, what if you were to change something, what could be changed? Or what would you like to see different? You don't usually hear REALTORS talking about that. They might say, hey, how long have you lived here, when you're thinking moving? And the traditional sales kind of stuff. But you didn't approach it from that at all. You're like, I want to have all the knowledge of this area. So I can be a tour guide and I can also be of service to the residents. And you just kept going from there. And it was all about being of service. And that obviously you look, you're on all of these boards and committees. And we should also mention too. I know this may have gotten lost in all of the things I was talking about, all the accolades you've accomplished. But Alex is a 30 under 30 NAR National Association REALTORS Honorary. That is a very big deal. And so what the National Association REALTORS does every year is they take a look at the thousands and thousands of agents, oh gosh, probably tens of thousands of agents who are under 30, maybe even 100,000 or more. And they look at people who are doing exceptional things. So that's a huge accolade and a huge thing under your belt. But I love the ideas you just seem like you want to build community. And I think that that is boy, what a smart, what a smart and also fulfilling thing. And it's fun. I imagine it's all fun. It's a fun business. It's a people ask you, I've been to all the time, like, bye, you've got all these cool listings. You've always got this unique stuff. And it's not only getting to represent those properties, it's getting to sell them too. I mean, it's fun getting to tell their story. And I always, so the other part is of how I built my business. So you mentioned fostering the community. But then I had a bunch of resources because sitting on all those boards gives me incredible access to information. And also because I'm now on the, so landmarks Illinois came back to me a year and a half later and asked me to be on the board of landmarks. Yeah, I imagine they would. They, and I'm still the youngest serving board member. I've been on for four years now. I'm still the youngest serving one. But they, so I have tremendous opportunities there for property, for homeowners that have a landmark property. So I've got a lot of information there. But the third piece of this is the, I mentioned earlier, whenever these are not easy properties to sell. And they are not the ones you put on the market got multiple offers. These are ones that sit for a while. Even in this market, they still sit. And I've done the craziest, most outlandish, absurd stuff to sell these properties. I had a mansion listed on Anster Street where, I'm filling, I had that co-listed actually where we put that one up for auction. That was in the middle of the pandemic in the summer of 2020. I had Brian Erlocker's house listed and we marketed that as a summer escape from the city of Furnish rental. Finally sold that to somebody that tore it down because they wanted the land. I've sold properties that are, you know, funky earth berm homes. I've sold, you know, they're just really out of the box ways of selling it. So not only is it getting in the door of these properties, it's having the resources to help them and be out of the box creativity to sell them. It's a three prong approach that, you know, for me, I would so much rather have a difficult listing than another two bed, two bed con, no one liked you. Like, that's nice, it pays the bills but it doesn't get me out of bed in the morning. Yeah, you like a challenge. I do. I do. And it's fulfilling because what the challenge, you know, really activates within you as I see it is creativity. All of a sudden, you're creative sparks. You know, Lakeview is a very popular neighborhood here in Chicago for those who aren't familiar and it's great neighborhood, lovely neighborhood, wonderful, not difficult to sell. Maybe difficult to get market share but if you get a listing there, it's probably going to sell. And it's going to sell pretty easily because it's so desirable. Point apart is less known and not less desirable for certain types of people, more desirable for others. But again, I love that you went to the part that like, I've never heard anybody in Chicago I want to be the boy in a park guy. No, I'm sure there are people that do but 90% of the people I hear who are working the city are like, I want to be the Lincoln Park guy, I want to be the Green North guy. These are the sort of glitzy, fun areas, gold coast, et cetera. And I love that you went the other way because and the reason why you did is you did the research and you go, there's a lot of opportunity here and it sort of meets my needs. I kind of like these funky homes. And now I got to figure out how to connect with the community and you did what, what an incredible story. And I know there's so much more to talk about but I think this is a great place to wrap up. I'm going to give a recommendation to our audience. I want you, if you can, if you were so inspired by Alex's story here about how he penetrated this community, I want you to go back and listen to the steps that he took because I really wanted to interrupt him every step of the way, be like, okay, cool, how'd you do that? And I didn't want to interrupt his flow but I want you guys to listen to it again because you will pick up exactly his thought process, how he did it. And boy, please go out and do what he did. You will have, if nothing else, you will have a really enjoyable career and you will have probably a very successful one as well. I also would like to mention that if you are a REALTOR in the Chicago land area and maybe you feel you're not getting the attention you need at your current firm or you're looking, this is the year where the market is down. People are looking to maybe switch firms, check out other teams, Alex's team is growing. So if you think you could be an asset to him or if you'd like to learn from him and you think you might be a good fit, reach out to him, you can find him on his website, altswolking.com, as well as Instagram and all the other social platforms he's on. So reach out to him if you think he might be a good fit. I know I would want to work with him if I was practicing so definitely reach out. I am so impressed. And also for everyone else who doesn't live in Chicago, you might have clients that move to Chicago and one of the coolest things about doing this show. I wish I could participate in the financial part of it, but even so it's so rewarding that almost every time we do an episode for anywhere in the country, that person ends up calling us later and goes, I just got a listing from one of your listeners who has somebody who's coming in to buy yourself. And so please, if you are looking for a Chicago agent just to even partner up with, boy, Alex would be a good one to partner up with. So reach out to him if, and by the way, Alex has people that leave Chicago too and he needs to refer business to other places. So maybe he doesn't have somebody in your market that he could be the referral to you for. So reach out to him. He's a wonderful guy and certainly doing all of the right things and somebody certainly to follow on social as well to see how he's marketing himself and he's not a really big social guy, but when he does his social stuff, it's actually really, really impressive and excellent. So anyway, everyone check out Alex, AlexWolking.com, link to all of his stuff in the show notes. And on behalf of the audience, Alex, thank you so much for being on our show.
