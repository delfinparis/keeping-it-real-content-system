[00:03:17] All right. Today on this show, we have team leader coach, author, broker, business owner, and
[00:03:26] forward thinker, Mitch, Mitch Rebek. And I want to tell you more about Mitch. He has this really
[00:03:32] long and impressive career. We're going to be really learning from a lot of his wisdom today. But
[00:03:37] Mitch has been an entrepreneur since the age of 19. And check this out. This is incredible. He's
[00:03:42] owned 23 different businesses in 18 different industries. He was the first online dating service
[00:03:48] and the third paintball business in the US. Now over the years, he's been in the restaurant
[00:03:53] business, flowers, advertising, marketing, call centers, and now real estate among many other
[00:03:59] industries. Currently, Rich Mitch runs tropical beach sidebroker by EXPs in Florida with over 150
[00:04:06] agents in Brevard County, Florida, and a total number of agents of 2,000 across the United States.
[00:04:14] Oh, actually, beyond the United States, not just the United States in seven countries,
[00:04:17] including the United States, almost as agents and almost every one of the US states,
[00:04:22] missing one. I'm curious which one he doesn't have. We'll have to see one of our listeners maybe
[00:04:26] can sign up with them and then he can get the full 50. But TRB, his company tropical beach sidebroker
[00:04:33] is been in the top 10 real estate brokerages since the opening the doors in 20 2005 tropical beach
[00:04:41] sidebrealt. He averages 800 plus transactions per year. That is impressive. Mitch became a REALTOR
[00:04:47] in 2001, quickly became successful through multiple avenues, including open houses and the internet.
[00:04:53] In 2008, Mitch published his first book, 100 mile per hour marketing for real estate
[00:04:58] and it quickly shot to number one in real estate books. In 2015, Mitch's second book, so you have
[00:05:04] your real estate license now. What is selling extremely well throughout North America. Mitch has a new
[00:05:09] book called The Big Lie, which we are going to talk about today as well. Mitch currently speaks
[00:05:14] throughout North America on a variety of subjects, including internet marketing and lead conversion
[00:05:18] inside sales agents, mindset, open houses, sphere of influence, expectations, and how to kick off
[00:05:24] your career in real estate among other subjects. Mitch currently lives in Merritt Island, Florida
[00:05:29] with his wife, Jeanette. They have four grown children and for beautiful grandchildren, Lola,
[00:05:33] Henry, Cash and Logan. I want everybody to check out Mitch's website, which is Mitch
[00:05:40] Rebek.com. That's R-I-B-A-K. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. We will also have a link
[00:05:45] to all of Mitch's books and also everything Mitch related with social media as well. So check that
[00:05:51] out. Mitch, welcome to the show. Hey, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Very excited to
[00:05:56] talk about it. I sound the most important there. It's crazy. Well, you are an important person,
[00:06:02] and I'm excited that I always find that the most important people, for the most part, tend to be
[00:06:07] the most humble as well. So we're glad to have you on the show. Tell us, gosh, you've done so many
[00:06:12] things, and you've done things before real estate. I know you've done things after you're still in
[00:06:17] real estate, and you're also owning businesses outside of real estate. But tell us like how and
[00:06:21] why did you get into real estate? Desperation broke. So like you said, I was the first online
[00:06:28] dating service, which was a lot of fun. I had a at asquitch.com, which is my advice column. I had
[00:06:36] a asquitch to date Dr. Radio Show on 45 radio stations. Six million people a month can be
[00:06:41] going to our sites. And then the contract for ridiculous amount of money because that's what we
[00:06:46] did back in the the.com boom right? Sure. And too much before we were supposed to close, now as
[00:06:51] you tired you have 40 years old, the in-appable burst and started by $82 million and I lost.
[00:06:56] I was a bad couple days. And still ran the business until we ran out of money, but after that
[00:07:02] there was no more raising money in the internet. And so my buddy Joe was a developer from
[00:07:08] the boss. He's like, Mitch, get your real estate license. I'm like, no, I don't like REALTORS. Why
[00:07:11] would I do that? He'd be good at it. I don't want to do that. I literally had three months with a
[00:07:16] remedy left. So I got my real estate license and honestly, it's probably the easiest thing I've
[00:07:22] ever done besides paintball. Meaning I sold 36 homes in my first year, 50, my second, 80, my
[00:07:30] third and fourth years since that my team and I started my brokerage. And I don't understand
[00:07:35] not selling homes because I find it very simple. So we can have some conversations about that,
[00:07:41] but ultimately it's what you get this because you get what you put into it, right?
[00:07:46] Yeah. I think it's a very fair business in that sense where if you're willing to put in the
[00:07:51] effort, I think the path to success, well there's many paths to success as a real estate agent,
[00:07:57] but those paths have been well-trot and they are well-defined. You can read books. You can watch
[00:08:02] YouTube videos. You can hire coaches. You can join a brokerage that will assist you. It can be
[00:08:07] done. And it can be done whether you brand new to a city and you just moved and you have no
[00:08:12] sphere of influence or you live there your whole life. I am curious for you when you say it's the easiest
[00:08:17] part that the easiest thing you've done, why do you think you found it so doable? Well, I have
[00:08:24] a suspicion of why you found it easier than maybe other people would find it. And I suspect,
[00:08:29] and I want you to correct me if I'm wrong, but I suspect it's because you understand how to run
[00:08:34] businesses. Yeah, well, I'm an entrepreneur. So yeah, I walked in my first day of the brokerage
[00:08:39] and my broker the time said, just so you know, I don't do any training at all, but all the
[00:08:44] things follow up follow up follow up, which by the way, it was a blessing. So on day one, I wrote my
[00:08:50] business plan. I didn't know anything different. I didn't know real estate's don't write business plans.
[00:08:54] So day one, I wrote my business plan. Day two is 9-11. So we kind of stopped that thing. Sure.
[00:08:59] very right today. Um, I think bout of пока dad is we're going to be using带 powers.
[00:09:08] We have self-criticism which means that systems in think into the world, we have stronger
[00:09:15] and more Indian people who know our damn. So now I want to say that my local sitting
[00:09:18] together. If I had a big question about am I, why am they nothing more standard carυers?
[00:09:29] sales cycle generate needs, their children needs, close the lead and create a customer
[00:09:33] for life.
[00:09:34] I don't care what product you sell.
[00:09:35] That's the cycle for sure.
[00:09:38] So I knew all this stuff going in.
[00:09:39] So I had a little advantage over your average person who was a teacher or a bartender or
[00:09:43] whatever they did, prior.
[00:09:45] But I knew how to generate needs.
[00:09:46] I knew I didn't know anybody.
[00:09:47] Everybody told me, don't do open house and don't do internet, 2001.
[00:09:54] So open houses, I said, if you're told me not to do that, but people are coming to
[00:09:57] me.
[00:09:57] How can that be a bad thing?
[00:09:59] I'm getting leads.
[00:10:01] Yeah.
[00:10:01] And the same thing with internet.
[00:10:02] My background was internet being the first online dating service.
[00:10:05] So I would not do that.
[00:10:07] So I did, and I went my first contract and five days in and I started in September that
[00:10:12] January had nine closings.
[00:10:14] Wow.
[00:10:15] And so one of the things I learned, and I started this from day one, not knowing to do this,
[00:10:20] but my January first is actually November first.
[00:10:23] And what I've learned is during November, December almost every real time, no quiz.
[00:10:28] They hit their, they go into hibernation.
[00:10:30] Well, they hit their goal and they're stopped.
[00:10:33] I'm going to take a break.
[00:10:34] Well, they did hit their goal.
[00:10:35] They won't hit it.
[00:10:36] So they take a break.
[00:10:37] They take a break.
[00:10:37] And it's a holiday that I learned.
[00:10:40] Why not sell during November, December.
[00:10:42] So I started off with a massive amount of sales.
[00:10:45] And so I started by your going strong.
[00:10:47] So I didn't have any doubt.
[00:10:50] Like, if you build a really good system, you don't have mountains.
[00:10:53] I had two months of my entire selling career, where I didn't have sales.
[00:10:57] It's incredible.
[00:10:59] Because you were always focused on lead gen and nurturing and follow up.
[00:11:03] And that can be done really any day of the year, no matter what's happening.
[00:11:08] Yeah, maybe, you know, obviously 9-11 probably wouldn't have been the right day,
[00:11:11] but aside from a major catastrophe like that, any day of the, any day of the year,
[00:11:16] you can prospect whether it's, you know, and again, holidays excluded maybe.
[00:11:20] But you can even do it maybe on the holidays.
[00:11:22] But certainly, you're right.
[00:11:24] We have agents.
[00:11:24] They shut down.
[00:11:25] They tend to shut down at the later part of the year.
[00:11:28] You know, there's not as much activity, which is what they'll say.
[00:11:32] There's not as many buyers, not as many sellers.
[00:11:34] People aren't as motivated.
[00:11:35] And yet, the people I know who are the most successful don't stop.
[00:11:40] They really, it's just like, okay, they just pivot.
[00:11:42] And they just do different things between, you know, November and December.
[00:11:47] And yeah, and the rest of us, it's really a great time to pick up market share,
[00:11:51] I think, because so many agents are going to take it easy.
[00:11:55] Yeah, well, that's what they do.
[00:11:56] They, you know, it's kind of, again, these are what I brought the book, I have the big lie.
[00:12:02] It's kind of what we're talking.
[00:12:03] It's really slow in November, December.
[00:12:04] So that's when you rebuild your systems and get all this stuff going.
[00:12:07] And of course, then you start working in January.
[00:12:09] You have your first contract late January, February, you'll be first picked to late February.
[00:12:15] And then I was like, you know, as a brokerage, I was the central bank of REALTORS for every, every January,
[00:12:22] because then my wealth is work.
[00:12:23] And then it's going to have our five grand, I can't pay my mortgage.
[00:12:28] Yeah, you know, and this really leads us into what I think, you know, again,
[00:12:34] you're obviously a skilled salesperson.
[00:12:37] And I don't, I know that can even be sort of seen as a negative connotation these days,
[00:12:41] because we think sometimes salespeople are not, you know, maybe not the most, you know,
[00:12:47] good feeling people that that we, when we think about it,
[00:12:50] but Mitch is really what he is is a great visit, a great entrepreneur and a great lead generator.
[00:12:56] And I heard Brian, I think it was Brian Tracy said many, many years ago,
[00:13:01] and 20 years ago, I heard him in a conference and he said,
[00:13:04] just so you know, for all your business owners, prospecting solves all problems.
[00:13:09] And, you know, and of course, that's not absolutely true, but it's pretty close, absolutely true,
[00:13:14] because if you have, you know, you could be a terrible REALTOR, you could never improve your skills.
[00:13:19] And if all you did was double the number of prospects that you have in your database,
[00:13:24] you will double your business.
[00:13:26] Just, I mean, assuming, assuming you would.
[00:13:28] And that's a pretty interesting thing.
[00:13:31] So you don't, of course, you want to improve your skills as well.
[00:13:34] But if you just double your, double your prospecting, you should double your income.
[00:13:37] Well, here's what I've realized a few years ago.
[00:13:40] There's one common alley for every business that I've owned.
[00:13:43] It is building the foundation.
[00:13:45] What's the foundation?
[00:13:46] Who's my customer? Where are they?
[00:13:48] Yeah.
[00:13:48] Every business I've ever brought.
[00:13:50] And I didn't have that blessing here because I did know he looks at my girlfriend.
[00:13:54] But this most of the REALTORS I meet within train,
[00:13:57] they have more context in their cell phone,
[00:13:59] they'll ever need the rest of their life.
[00:14:02] I couldn't, I could not agree with you more.
[00:14:04] And I want to, I want to just say this in case it just slipped by and people didn't hear it.
[00:14:10] What Mitch just said is, in Mitch has 2000 agents.
[00:14:12] So this is not something he's not just like, well, just works for Mitch.
[00:14:15] No, no, Mitch is, this is what Mitch teaches everybody.
[00:14:17] It's the reason why he's been so successful.
[00:14:20] Everybody listening right now has more contacts in their database.
[00:14:25] Then, then they probably need, because a certain percentage of those people
[00:14:28] are going to transact in real estate every single year.
[00:14:32] And you want to, of course, be the person they think about.
[00:14:34] And the numbers actually seven out of a hundred.
[00:14:37] So we know the number that's been around for a lot of years.
[00:14:40] They actually say a lot of, but I like to say I like to set expectations low.
[00:14:44] Sure.
[00:14:45] But, but the reality is, so I'll give you an example.
[00:14:46] I have 2000 contacts in my phone.
[00:14:49] I would equate to 140 sales a share.
[00:14:52] Now, you have to go back and say, why does someone use you as a REALTOR?
[00:14:56] And there's only one reason.
[00:14:59] Right? So I'll ask that I need a class of a thousand people recently.
[00:15:02] And I asked that not one person got it right.
[00:15:04] The only week.
[00:15:06] Can I guess?
[00:15:07] Yeah.
[00:15:08] Okay. My guess is the reason why they chose you is they trust you.
[00:15:14] See, I'm wrong. Okay.
[00:15:15] Tell me why they chose you.
[00:15:16] They only use you because you happen to be in front of them.
[00:15:19] And that they keep our binders.
[00:15:20] You know what? That is absolutely true.
[00:15:23] That's it.
[00:15:24] And so because I stopped selling a few years ago, I really got to look at the business completely different.
[00:15:30] Now, I have, I've always was working in the, I was just as guilty.
[00:15:33] That's where I get my room at the book, but where he in the business, not on the business.
[00:15:37] And when I step back three years ago from selling.
[00:15:40] And by the way, I was always in front of my people twice a month.
[00:15:43] And I would get 40 to 80 calls every year to sell home.
[00:15:47] Now, I didn't sell that because I didn't want to.
[00:15:49] Right?
[00:15:49] But I got that many the day I stopped, which is October 2021.
[00:15:53] The next year, I got six phone calls this year.
[00:15:57] I've got three.
[00:16:00] Because I stopped doing it.
[00:16:01] I don't want to sell it anymore.
[00:16:03] Now, I might go back and build a referral company for the front of it because I'm an entrepreneur.
[00:16:06] I have to do stuff.
[00:16:08] But, um, but the reality is that's the reason.
[00:16:10] So once you know that, then you have to scientifically.
[00:16:14] It's made up work.
[00:16:14] And you have to figure out what's the right response.
[00:16:17] We've tested all this the years now.
[00:16:19] We've learned if you said once a once a week, it's too much.
[00:16:22] Yeah.
[00:16:23] If you said once a month or so, that's when we came up with the every other week.
[00:16:27] Yeah, it's if you are dripping on people every other week.
[00:16:31] And I imagine does this include all forms of communication?
[00:16:34] This could be email tax.
[00:16:37] That's just that's just email.
[00:16:38] Just email.
[00:16:39] So emailing every two weeks with something of value.
[00:16:42] So there's only two things.
[00:16:43] The only two things you said to him.
[00:16:44] This is so simple, my boy.
[00:16:45] I love it.
[00:16:46] The first email that goes out is the market update because it's different every month than people will look at it.
[00:16:51] Most of us will send these newsletters to nobody cares about it.
[00:16:54] Right.
[00:16:55] That's true.
[00:16:56] Do you read newsletters?
[00:16:57] If you're watching this day, do you read newsletters?
[00:16:59] I did a presentation once called nobody wants to read your newsletter.
[00:17:02] Right.
[00:17:03] So the first one is that.
[00:17:05] And then the second one, two weeks letters to top 10 things out is my top 10 things to do in the very coming.
[00:17:10] Okay.
[00:17:11] This is a brilliant thing.
[00:17:12] So I'm here in Chicago.
[00:17:13] I apologize.
[00:17:14] I don't want you to steal your thunder, but Mitch is so absolutely dead on.
[00:17:18] I have a friend of Cole.
[00:17:19] She's I wish she was one of our brokers.
[00:17:21] She isn't, but she's a friend of mine here in Chicago.
[00:17:23] We have 47,000 agents in the in the area.
[00:17:26] She's the only I'm sure there's a few others that do it.
[00:17:29] But the only one I know and I know I know a lot of those agents.
[00:17:32] The only one that does top.
[00:17:34] She does top five things to do this weekend in the city of Chicago in the suburbs.
[00:17:38] Kind of you know, and I look forward to it every week because I actually plan my weekends with it.
[00:17:44] So this is such a brilliant idea.
[00:17:46] I'm so glad you do that.
[00:17:47] So last last agent I talked to do this at her first four months, got six or six and four buyers out of a database of only 400.
[00:17:54] Wow.
[00:17:55] Yeah.
[00:17:56] So so again, it goes back to building your foundation, which unfortunately most brokers don't know that either.
[00:18:02] Yeah.
[00:18:03] Right.
[00:18:03] And nothing gets broken.
[00:18:04] So it's just that one of the lot of companies you learn by losing millions of millions of millions of dollars.
[00:18:08] How to be good.
[00:18:10] Yeah.
[00:18:11] Well, you have to be willing to fail too, right?
[00:18:13] You have to be willing to try things and and you know, and again, it's not really a failure, but not getting the result that you wanted and then going, OK, how do I?
[00:18:21] It's only way we learn is through through mistakes, right?
[00:18:24] And testing is really important.
[00:18:25] So when I started out again, being with the optional backup, I didn't do things for a week until I didn't work.
[00:18:31] My minimum test was six months.
[00:18:34] Yeah.
[00:18:34] But everything is when I'm mastered open houses and I never sold less than 24 homes in a year from open houses.
[00:18:40] I was between 24 and 30 homes.
[00:18:42] I just mastered it.
[00:18:43] And I came up with different things.
[00:18:45] I, oh, if I do this, this will happen.
[00:18:47] What if than this, right?
[00:18:49] 
[00:18:49] And it came really simple and became a lot of things.
[00:18:52] So the blessing of not being any training, everything that I, I, I developed, I developed like internet leak conversion.
[00:18:58] When I was the first person doing post registration in January 2002, I started my first website.
[00:19:04] And nobody was doing post registration.
[00:19:06] Right. Yeah, we was right. That's true.
[00:19:08] I had so many REALTORS yell at me.
[00:19:11] I can't believe you make people register on your site.
[00:19:13] I'm like, I can't believe you don't.
[00:19:15] Yeah, right.
[00:19:16] Right. This is we want their information.
[00:19:19] So they said, well, I said 50% of the people who are registering.
[00:19:22] They're like, what about the other 85% of like what about it?
[00:19:25] Yeah, local sublimation.
[00:19:26] I'm going to maximize that 15%.
[00:19:28] So it's just thinking differently.
[00:19:31] So that was, you know, when I looked back at my business over the last year, the last 23 years, I'm in the business.
[00:19:37] The thing I, the common thing I think the people that we see is successful in our business.
[00:19:42] Our successful selling homes, but they're not successful in business.
[00:19:47] Yeah, there's a lot of top producers that I suspect.
[00:19:51] They don't often share this.
[00:19:53] Although some of them have shared this even on this show is that they could have the highest production year.
[00:19:59] Ever.
[00:20:00] Maybe it's selling 80 homes or more and they're like, I didn't make any money.
[00:20:03] And, and that's shocking, but it's something to think about because maybe they're overspending or they're not managing the finances.
[00:20:10] Whatever.
[00:20:11] Well, they're not running a business, but, you know, I said earlier, we're talking before the show is, you know, most people don't look happy job.
[00:20:19] They might own their copy job.
[00:20:22] And, but that's not just real. So it's everybody I know every call business guy doesn't really want to business. They have a copy job.
[00:20:27] Right.
[00:20:27] And they get better.
[00:20:28] And they get better.
[00:20:28] And they're better than I thought.
[00:20:29] It's just reality.
[00:20:30] So to be when I look back at my friends at the selling age, I was selling it.
[00:20:34] I had a copy job for the 80 or 100 hours week.
[00:20:38] And I was making good money.
[00:20:39] Couple to 300,000 dollars a year.
[00:20:41] But the reality is I had my life.
[00:20:44] You know, it's all came to fruition when I turned 60.
[00:20:48] And I look back at my life.
[00:20:49] I said, we do that every 10 years of your life, right?
[00:20:52] And I look back and say, I cannot tell you five things to take you with my kids.
[00:20:56] When they're growing up in that works.
[00:20:59] Sure.
[00:20:59] And there's a lot of you out there right now that are in your 30s and 40s or 20s.
[00:21:04] They have little kids.
[00:21:05] That's your most important job.
[00:21:08] Right.
[00:21:08] Your businesses, your business, if you want to business.
[00:21:11] But your most important job is not to do what I did.
[00:21:13] That's my future.
[00:21:14] It's why I wrote the book.
[00:21:15] I wrote this book in 90 days.
[00:21:18] My last two books took me two years each.
[00:21:20] I did this in 90 days because I've locked out four hours a day to write.
[00:21:24] Yeah.
[00:21:24] So I can make sure I give this book out because I didn't post on social media.
[00:21:27] Just talking about that.
[00:21:29] About how most people build copy jobs.
[00:21:31] And I got 262 responses.
[00:21:35] Wow.
[00:21:35] And everybody was in pain.
[00:21:38] And so people said, Mitch, what are you teaching now?
[00:21:40] I mean, I can teach all this stuff to sell houses.
[00:21:43] But really when I teach this to each other, get freedom.
[00:21:46] Yeah.
[00:21:46] Let's talk about that.
[00:21:47] So the book is the big lie.
[00:21:51] Let's tell us what is the big lie.
[00:21:53] Okay.
[00:21:53] So the big lie is sell out of homes.
[00:21:55] And you'll be successful.
[00:21:56] And once you do that, start a team.
[00:21:59] Yeah.
[00:21:59] And they don't tell you you're going to start a big city job.
[00:22:01] And then because you need to get more split because you're not making money as a team.
[00:22:05] You start a brokerage.
[00:22:06] Right.
[00:22:06] And it's all ego based.
[00:22:10] Like I know so many of my friends, why I adore who will not listen to me because I'm the guy.
[00:22:16] About my own my brokerage with 120 agents.
[00:22:19] You know, I was the guy that's really feels good, right?
[00:22:23] That doesn't pay your bills.
[00:22:24] It feels good.
[00:22:25] Sure.
[00:22:26] So I see these guys.
[00:22:27] I'll give it an example of one of my friends.
[00:22:28] He does about eight or 100 homes every year.
[00:22:30] And he works at least a hundred hours a week.
[00:22:33] And there's a reason why there's a hamster on the cover of my book.
[00:22:38] And I said, why are you doing that?
[00:22:40] How many people are you doing the buyers?
[00:22:42] He goes, have.
[00:22:44] I go, why are you showing property?
[00:22:46] Well, my customers trust me.
[00:22:48] I go, why are you showing property?
[00:22:50] He doesn't, he doesn't get it.
[00:22:53] And he still doesn't get it by way.
[00:22:54] He won't listen.
[00:22:54] I can't fix that.
[00:22:56] But I have a lot of people who fix him right now.
[00:22:57] Right now, I have 16s over the middle of the middle of the transformer into the modern team model that we teach him.
[00:23:03] So what I realized early on is what are my superpowers?
[00:23:07] My superpowers, I'm really good at actually really, really good at negotiating.
[00:23:11] I'm really, really good at finding the house, which I still don't do.
[00:23:14] It's kind of fun.
[00:23:15] And I'm really, really good at making sure it closes.
[00:23:18] It doesn't mean I do all those jobs, by the way.
[00:23:20] This is a really good recording.
[00:23:22] So when I talk to my customers, because this is the pushback, I get from agents.
[00:23:25] Well, my customers trust me like he said earlier.
[00:23:27] Sure.
[00:23:28] I go, yeah, but they trust you to make sure they get the best deal possible.
[00:23:31] And they close.
[00:23:33] Anybody can open doors.
[00:23:34] So when I talk to a customer and say, DJ, let me explain how I run my business.
[00:23:38] By the way, you'll never hear me say, how I do my job.
[00:23:40] Josh, be crazy.
[00:23:41] Right?
[00:23:42] That's how it is.
[00:23:42] I don't explain how I run my business.
[00:23:44] So my superpower is a negotiate, finding your home, negotiate the best deal you'll ever get.
[00:23:49] And making sure it closes.
[00:23:50] I'm really, really good at it.
[00:23:51] I'm not really good at it.
[00:23:52] I'm really, really good at it.
[00:23:54] And I go, what I don't do is I don't show property.
[00:23:57] So I want to make sure something's available.
[00:23:58] So you probably, when you want to see it.
[00:24:01] Anybody can open the doors, right?
[00:24:03] Absolutely.
[00:24:04] And I wait till they say that.
[00:24:06] Because they don't say that I'm going to continue on that road.
[00:24:08] They've never not said it.
[00:24:09] By the way, everybody says yes.
[00:24:11] And I'm always saying anybody's short, right?
[00:24:12] They also because people know when they walk into a home and it's the right home.
[00:24:16] They know.
[00:24:17] They don't say maybe they need a little push here and there, but typically speaking, they know.
[00:24:21] Yeah, this is very little sales.
[00:24:23] The sales is prospecting.
[00:24:25] Right?
[00:24:25] Like we talked about earlier.
[00:24:26] Yes.
[00:24:26] Right?
[00:24:27] That's the sales of this.
[00:24:28] This is.
[00:24:28] So when you really break down the numbers, I'm the numbers guy.
[00:24:32] My average agent when I had my team was working five thousand of dips.
[00:24:35] I negotiated all the deals.
[00:24:37] My sister wrote all the authors.
[00:24:38] They went to they show property went to the inspection with the closing.
[00:24:41] Every five hours on a $400,000 sale.
[00:24:44] That meant I was taking them $1,000 an hour to show houses.
[00:24:50] Can I sign up for that?
[00:24:51] Can I?
[00:24:52] I'll do that.
[00:24:53] Right?
[00:24:53] But that's what everybody does.
[00:24:55] And here's the worst part.
[00:24:57] Maybe he said to me.
[00:24:59] Because I only gave them 50%.
[00:25:01] Right.
[00:25:02] You generated the lead and you're paying them $1,000 an hour, but you're right.
[00:25:06] But you're right.
[00:25:06] They have the employee mentality.
[00:25:09] Right.
[00:25:09] So with my bottom team model, I pay just $25,000 in the show house.
[00:25:14] Now depending on where they are, I got two teams in California right now.
[00:25:18] They pay $7,000 in the show house.
[00:25:19] Sure.
[00:25:20] So adjusted for living.
[00:25:22] Yeah.
[00:25:22] But I pay $75 an hour.
[00:25:25] And instead of giving them 50%.
[00:25:27] I mean, $20 an hour.
[00:25:28] Instead of giving them 50%.
[00:25:29] I give them 10% bonus.
[00:25:32] And they're happy.
[00:25:34] I'm still paying them by the way $250 an hour shows.
[00:25:37] Right.
[00:25:38] Right.
[00:25:38] In the end.
[00:25:39] But then on my team anymore.
[00:25:42] They're just agents that I contract to do tasks.
[00:25:46] And my team consistent myself.
[00:25:49] An assistant.
[00:25:50] A an inside sales agent.
[00:25:53] And a transaction coordinator.
[00:25:54] That's my team.
[00:25:55] No more babysitting.
[00:25:57] Now I didn't have a pushback from an agent last week, which is fun.
[00:26:00] I love getting pushed back.
[00:26:01] So much fun.
[00:26:02] So she goes, well, you're not nice to new agents.
[00:26:05] I go actually get to stay in the business now.
[00:26:09] Because I wouldn't have given that to them.
[00:26:11] I don't know if you're right.
[00:26:12] Right.
[00:26:12] So now I'm not talking to you leaders.
[00:26:14] I'm just about ages of cell 60, 70, 80 plus homes a year.
[00:26:18] It happened almost all those people almost half of our buy.
[00:26:21] Are agents almost sure buyers is that actually I get to keep them in the business.
[00:26:25] It's a number of reason why agents fail is they don't have cash flow.
[00:26:29] Right.
[00:26:30] I'm giving them cash flow.
[00:26:32] So what's I explain?
[00:26:33] I see actually decided to put you for me.
[00:26:36] And so what.
[00:26:38] But what I'm teaching people is now I can run my business from anywhere.
[00:26:43] Because reality is my system.
[00:26:45] My system can reach the 19 years.
[00:26:47] I don't have to do home search.
[00:26:48] She does something better than I do.
[00:26:50] Right.
[00:26:50] She can go to even the gochets better than I do now.
[00:26:53] But.
[00:26:54] I don't have to work.
[00:26:56] I and I can do everything I want from anywhere.
[00:26:58] If I was still selling now, I would even do listening to this anymore.
[00:27:01] I'd pay an agent hourly plus a bonus.
[00:27:04] If they get listening.
[00:27:05] I give 250 dollars for the.
[00:27:08] For the listing appointment and.
[00:27:10] 10% of the gap.
[00:27:11] Now, would you train them on your listing appointment method?
[00:27:15] No, we have it.
[00:27:16] Yeah.
[00:27:17] So so basically what we're doing is is creating a sort of almost gig economy.
[00:27:24] Sort of situation where people are doing a task.
[00:27:27] They're getting paid for a task.
[00:27:29] And they get a residual if if the deal closes.
[00:27:32] So the thing that I do is.
[00:27:32] So, you know, you know,
[00:27:32] you know, you know, what I do is you're telling.
[00:27:33] You're setting the expectation to the client.
[00:27:35] Here's how it works.
[00:27:36] Here's why I do it this way.
[00:27:37] Not just.
[00:27:38] Hey, you're not going to see me until.
[00:27:39] You know until until the close or close.
[00:27:41] No, you're intentionally not going to see me because.
[00:27:44] The most important thing is I get you the highest price.
[00:27:47] I close the deal.
[00:27:48] That's what I am best at.
[00:27:50] So what I'm going to do that.
[00:27:51] I'm going to I'm going to have my, you know, my, my partners do.
[00:27:54] I was.
[00:27:55] I was.
[00:27:55] I was invited to music, I was invited to music,illingly.
[00:27:56] And then.
[00:27:56] 
[00:27:56] 
[00:27:56] 
[00:27:56] 
[00:27:56] 
[00:27:56] 
[00:27:58] Yeah, I, I think that is.
[00:28:00] Now.
[00:28:00] Here's a question.
[00:28:01] and you say you're no longer babysitting.
[00:28:04] However, what if an agent is late to an appointment?
[00:28:07] You're made there doing the home showing or they screw up.
[00:28:10] Like how do you sort of deal with that?
[00:28:12] Yeah, I haven't had that problem.
[00:28:14] In all the times I've done it.
[00:28:16] Now, if it happened, they would never,
[00:28:18] I'd never use it again.
[00:28:19] You know, so it's not like,
[00:28:21] well, I have an agent I have to fire,
[00:28:22] anything I just never use it again.
[00:28:24] Sure.
[00:28:24] You know, and the only thing that,
[00:28:26] the only other place that I do get involved
[00:28:28] when they do pick a house before, right?
[00:28:30] It'd be our private looking house.
[00:28:31] Yeah.
[00:28:32] Because I deviate expertise of seeing the leak of the ceiling.
[00:28:36] Sure.
[00:28:36] You know, I do have my customers,
[00:28:38] but we're talking about 15 minutes, right?
[00:28:41] Half hour maybe.
[00:28:42] And now you have time for, well,
[00:28:44] and obviously now your children are growing,
[00:28:46] but you now have the time that you didn't have
[00:28:48] when you were younger and they were younger.
[00:28:51] And it's amazing.
[00:28:54] You have taught this to people as well.
[00:28:56] I am curious to hear,
[00:28:59] because you are going to get pushed back from, sorry,
[00:29:02] anyone who's got doing 80 deals a year,
[00:29:05] there's an ego associated with that
[00:29:07] because they've done it successfully.
[00:29:09] And whether they're making money or not,
[00:29:11] they're doing 80 deals a year,
[00:29:12] which is very impressive to the overall community
[00:29:15] and also their clients,
[00:29:16] yet the quality of their life,
[00:29:18] like you were saying, quality of your life
[00:29:19] wasn't as good as you wanted it to be.
[00:29:21] So you're now teaching people,
[00:29:23] you're really teaching them how to do
[00:29:24] is have a better quality of life
[00:29:27] and just work not less,
[00:29:29] but more specifically on the things that you enjoy doing
[00:29:33] and then farming out the other things
[00:29:35] and paying a flat fee per sort of situation.
[00:29:39] Yeah, and I'm actually talking about working less.
[00:29:41] So I'm talking about some 80-homes a year
[00:29:43] working very out a week.
[00:29:45] Wow.
[00:29:46] And making a lot more money,
[00:29:48] because now you're profitable.
[00:29:50] Yeah.
[00:29:51] So you're not paying all these people.
[00:29:53] Excuse me.
[00:29:54] So to me, again,
[00:29:56] everybody I know in this business is successful,
[00:29:58] is not successful in life.
[00:30:00] And I know that the images are ego in it.
[00:30:02] Sorry I do that.
[00:30:03] And by the way,
[00:30:03] that person's not the person I'm hoping.
[00:30:05] Right.
[00:30:06] Just, I'll give you an example.
[00:30:07] Another example.
[00:30:08] I had a guy,
[00:30:09] Revex guy,
[00:30:09] I helped me suddenly,
[00:30:12] 62 years old,
[00:30:13] so you're younger than me.
[00:30:15] 80 homes a year for the last 35 years.
[00:30:17] Wow.
[00:30:18] It's made a ton of money.
[00:30:20] So he's making money.
[00:30:22] And when we started talking,
[00:30:23] I said to him,
[00:30:24] never get married, never get kids,
[00:30:25] because he's that guy that,
[00:30:27] oh, I got to make a, he couldn't do it, right?
[00:30:29] Right, it's working too much.
[00:30:30] 
[00:30:31] So I said to him,
[00:30:32] I go,
[00:30:33] what are you doing?
[00:30:34] He said, what do you mean?
[00:30:34] I go, you know, you're going to die soon, right?
[00:30:36] He is, he's 62 years old.
[00:30:38] Yeah.
[00:30:38] We got 20, 20 years up,
[00:30:40] really 10 or 15,
[00:30:41] all the years, right?
[00:30:43] Sure.
[00:30:43] I mean, I'm going to look to 142,
[00:30:45] exactly another 40 years of good life.
[00:30:47] But the reality is,
[00:30:49] at least that in crying.
[00:30:50] Yeah.
[00:30:50] It was really sad,
[00:30:52] because he never really took the moment
[00:30:53] to look back at your life.
[00:30:55] So here's my, but I want you,
[00:30:57] everybody listen to this.
[00:30:58] I want you to do this exercise.
[00:31:00] I call it the mirror to your success.
[00:31:02] And I do this every single day.
[00:31:04] I want you to, when you get off this call,
[00:31:06] I want you to go in your bathroom,
[00:31:08] looking at your eye in the mirror,
[00:31:10] and looking at your eyes, right?
[00:31:12] Because you cannot lie to yourself.
[00:31:14] When you're looking at you,
[00:31:15] you can rationalize,
[00:31:16] stab you down the screen.
[00:31:17] But you can't look in your eyes, lie yourself.
[00:31:19] And I want you to ask yourself,
[00:31:21] are you really living the life you want in there?
[00:31:24] Yeah.
[00:31:24] And you know what,
[00:31:25] the answer is going to be,
[00:31:25] it's going to be,
[00:31:26] of course, yeah.
[00:31:27] It's going to be,
[00:31:27] because you're missing your kids,
[00:31:29] grow up,
[00:31:30] you're missing your life.
[00:31:31] And that's what this guy did.
[00:31:32] And I did, I'm lucky,
[00:31:34] I'm lucky I've been getting it out at 60 to go forward.
[00:31:37] And now I travel a time,
[00:31:38] and I go wait for a month
[00:31:39] and nobody knows who gone.
[00:31:39] It's great,
[00:31:41] because I run businesses,
[00:31:42] but I really want to save people right now.
[00:31:45] And I actually have another book
[00:31:46] I'm writing called The Big Life Entrepreneurs,
[00:31:49] then I'm going to start writing a project next week or two,
[00:31:51] because I don't want to solve REALTORS,
[00:31:52] I want to help everybody.
[00:31:54] It's a shame
[00:31:56] that you're making all this money
[00:31:58] for the ones that are making money.
[00:31:59] It's worse if you're not making money,
[00:32:00] and you're doing this,
[00:32:01] what the hell are you doing?
[00:32:03] But the ones that are making a 300, 400 grand a year,
[00:32:06] I have lots of friends of mine,
[00:32:07] and you're doing that.
[00:32:08] And then they're running a team,
[00:32:09] or they're just,
[00:32:10] it's a little agent,
[00:32:11] and they're working 100 hours a week,
[00:32:13] you're missing your life,
[00:32:14] don't do it.
[00:32:15] Don't do it.
[00:32:16] It's a lot.
[00:32:17] Yeah.
[00:32:18] And you know, Mitch,
[00:32:19] you said something at the beginning,
[00:32:20] and I just want to reiterate this,
[00:32:21] and I apologize,
[00:32:22] it might seem a bit out of order,
[00:32:24] but it's so important,
[00:32:26] because I really,
[00:32:28] you know, I always like
[00:32:30] when our listeners like take action
[00:32:32] on some of the,
[00:32:33] obviously the things our guests say,
[00:32:35] and you said something very, very powerful,
[00:32:37] and I just want to make sure that people are here to,
[00:32:41] to hear it one more time,
[00:32:42] which is,
[00:32:43] Mitch's follow-up,
[00:32:44] a part of his follow-up,
[00:32:45] was sending two emails a month,
[00:32:47] one was a market update,
[00:32:49] and then two weeks later,
[00:32:50] here's what's going on in the area,
[00:32:52] fun, cool things for the family, for yourself, whatever.
[00:32:55] That's, that was his follow-up,
[00:32:56] and that means that those people got 26 emails a year,
[00:33:01] and the reason why Mitch said that is,
[00:33:03] you know, do people really want to read your market out?
[00:33:06] Look, maybe, maybe not,
[00:33:07] doesn't matter.
[00:33:07] What matters is that they're getting repeated information
[00:33:10] from you,
[00:33:11] that is,
[00:33:12] it could be useful to them,
[00:33:13] it's not annoying to them,
[00:33:14] and, you know, they're just getting that repetition,
[00:33:17] and Mitch said the whole thing is precipitated on,
[00:33:20] who's right in front of them when they decide they need
[00:33:23] to sell, to buy or sell,
[00:33:25] and that's exactly right,
[00:33:26] and it's hard not to be on somebody's mind
[00:33:28] if you're hitting them every two weeks.
[00:33:30] Yeah, and the thing is, so ultimately,
[00:33:33] I am, so one of the books I've always,
[00:33:35] I can't tell you what's in it,
[00:33:36] because it's not his follow-up,
[00:33:37] I was throwing a podcast,
[00:33:39] but it's called Rockstar Sales Guy,
[00:33:41] it's, I saw it for a buck on Amazon,
[00:33:43] Rockstar Sales Guy, don't do chicken soup marketing.
[00:33:46] So I, I can see the email marketing,
[00:33:49] chicken soup marketing person, sure,
[00:33:51] but I know they're not gonna pick up the phone.
[00:33:54] Yeah, honestly, I didn't pick up the phone that one.
[00:33:56] Right.
[00:33:57] Yeah, I'm not, I mean, I'm not,
[00:33:58] you know, I came up with these things for myself too, right?
[00:34:01] But the reality is, it's really that simple,
[00:34:04] and there's two things that people always ask you
[00:34:06] when I say I'm a REALTOR.
[00:34:07] I say, you know, I've said I'm a REALTOR,
[00:34:09] the first thing I have about this,
[00:34:10] oh, you're REALTOR, how's the market?
[00:34:11] Right.
[00:34:13] So that's why we came up with the market update,
[00:34:15] it's a big issue.
[00:34:15] And it changes every month and people are interested in that.
[00:34:18] And then like you said,
[00:34:19] the top 10 things that we do, everybody, let's go on.
[00:34:22] So unlike the newsletters,
[00:34:23] we all get emails from people that we subscribe to at one point,
[00:34:27] and we don't unsubscribe a block there because we like them.
[00:34:31] Yeah.
[00:34:32] So we get these people, we never meet them.
[00:34:34] I get you, I get 30 newsletters from REALTOR's,
[00:34:36] I haven't read them years.
[00:34:37] Sure.
[00:34:38] Because that's the same thing.
[00:34:40] People are giving stuff like,
[00:34:41] you have to give a little market update
[00:34:42] and then they'll give how to get the best garden seeds
[00:34:45] for your garden.
[00:34:47] Or how to, I mean, nobody cares.
[00:34:50] Yeah.
[00:34:50] Nobody cares.
[00:34:51] I mean, that's just real, right?
[00:34:53] Nobody cares.
[00:34:54] And I've asked you, Superzaggo,
[00:34:55] do you ever read your newsletters from REALTOR?
[00:34:56] Like, no.
[00:34:57] You know, and I can see the open rates of the,
[00:34:59] when I was doing newsletters, nobody looked at it.
[00:35:02] But we get about, from our phone list,
[00:35:05] we get about a 30 to 50% open rate.
[00:35:08] And that is, that is a good open rate.
[00:35:11] Absolutely good.
[00:35:12] I'm a marketer too.
[00:35:14] I can appreciate, I wish I was getting those open rates.
[00:35:17] Other great.
[00:35:17] Yeah, I mean, you typically want your mask market,
[00:35:19] we get about a 15 to 20%, which is pretty good.
[00:35:22] Open rate.
[00:35:23] But when we do that phone,
[00:35:24] because here's the thing about the phone contacts,
[00:35:26] you know them all.
[00:35:28] Yeah.
[00:35:28] And then the messaging, I'm going to give you a line
[00:35:31] and I'll say the slowings, I can't for a Boston guy.
[00:35:34] But this is the way we end those emails,
[00:35:37] because how you end is really important.
[00:35:39] And it's like this, as you know, as a REALTOR,
[00:35:42] I work by referral only, and I can really, really use your help.
[00:35:46] If you know someone looking to buy a cell phone,
[00:35:48] could you send me their contact info?
[00:35:51] Now two things happening.
[00:35:53] I use the word really, really, because it's very powerful,
[00:35:55] psychologically.
[00:35:56] Yep.
[00:35:56] And I asked for their contact info,
[00:35:59] not give them my contact info.
[00:36:01] Right.
[00:36:01] Because they're not going to give them my contact info.
[00:36:03] Right.
[00:36:04] I did a class recently with 100 agents.
[00:36:08] And I don't do this class at all,
[00:36:09] because I believe lead generation is 34 ways to generate leads.
[00:36:13] And so I said, I made everybody in the class take out their phone,
[00:36:18] and go through their phone,
[00:36:19] just eight minutes and say,
[00:36:20] I'm in a class right now where I'm in a contest,
[00:36:23] and I can really, really use your help,
[00:36:24] you know somebody looking to buy a cell phone.
[00:36:26] Same contract, right.
[00:36:27] We generated 185 leads at eight minutes.
[00:36:31] Unbelievable.
[00:36:32] And that's more than one, almost more than,
[00:36:35] well, it's more than one lead per person.
[00:36:36] Well, we know that only half the people actually did it too, right?
[00:36:39] Right.
[00:36:40] Of course.
[00:36:40] So it's probably, it's even more than that.
[00:36:42] I was in a bar with one of my agents recently having a check.
[00:36:45] Yeah.
[00:36:46] Uh, business is bad.
[00:36:47] This is only bad.
[00:36:48] Your brain is bad.
[00:36:50] This is always good.
[00:36:51] Sure.
[00:36:51] If you're slow, it's because of you.
[00:36:53] Right.
[00:36:54] And, uh, and so I said, take away your phone.
[00:36:56] And I made him do that.
[00:36:57] He texted 50 people.
[00:36:59] He got two responses, so two over two weeks.
[00:37:03] Uh, I'm shaking my head only because
[00:37:05] what a simple idea would a simple concept and look,
[00:37:09] the Brian Biffini built a whole coaching business on follow up and sending out
[00:37:14] Makler's once a month.
[00:37:15] And there's more to it, obviously, is a lot, a lot of good stuff there.
[00:37:18] But that's the, the crux of it is, you know, just continually, you know,
[00:37:22] pound away in a way that's not offensive to your, to your, uh, sphere.
[00:37:26] Yeah.
[00:37:26] And then the only other part I would recommend on that part is pick up the phone
[00:37:30] for the connectors.
[00:37:31] Yeah.
[00:37:32] Like everybody who connect is right on a connective.
[00:37:34] You're, you know, show your connector, right?
[00:37:35] Yeah.
[00:37:36] Uh, you know, so, but here's the one thing I want you about being a connector.
[00:37:39] I had people asking me for stuff all the time.
[00:37:41] I love as many people in the world that want to.
[00:37:43] I love doing it.
[00:37:44] However, I get very frustrated when it's all about, take, not give.
[00:37:49] Yeah.
[00:37:49] So never, ever end your conversation with, thanks for looking me out and your conversation.
[00:37:54] What can I do for you?
[00:37:55] Yes.
[00:37:56] Right.
[00:37:57] And, and most times people are going to go, oh, I'm, I'm good.
[00:38:00] Oh, but, but hey, thanks.
[00:38:02] Yeah.
[00:38:02] It's, it's kind of like what we say when somebody, you know, loses somebody and we say,
[00:38:06] hey, so if there's anything I can do to help you through this, this, this difficult time.
[00:38:11] And nine times out of 10, they just go, oh, thanks for saying that.
[00:38:13] No, I'm good.
[00:38:14] But if I need something, I'll reach out.
[00:38:15] They don't reach out.
[00:38:16] But they appreciate that you care enough to say, hey, I want to help you.
[00:38:20] Yeah.
[00:38:21] Yeah.
[00:38:21] 
[00:38:21] I'm a huge, I tell everybody, I've slogan to many, many years, I don't sell you.
[00:38:25] I help you.
[00:38:26] Yeah.
[00:38:27] But I still want to tell about my coach.
[00:38:28] He goes this is to that.
[00:38:29] If you don't leave, that's great.
[00:38:30] Go keep working 100 hours a week and have a miserable life.
[00:38:33] And when you're 60 years old, you're going to look back at your life and go,
[00:38:35] shit, I missed my kid.
[00:38:36] I should have listened to that guy.
[00:38:37] I missed 20 years ago.
[00:38:40] But the reality is is if you sell from the heart and really care about people,
[00:38:46] this is an easy business.
[00:38:47] People know, people know if you're just a, you know, like what do they call it,
[00:38:51] commission breath, right?
[00:38:53] People know, I don't care about money.
[00:38:55] Even when I lost 82 million dollars and I got this business, I didn't do that.
[00:39:00] I said, I'm just going to help as many people as I can and be the best I can be at what I do.
[00:39:04] And I'm not going to get by the way.
[00:39:06] I'm just, I'm okay with it.
[00:39:07] I'm not the best.
[00:39:09] I mean, I can't read, you know, 80, I mean, you know, I'm okay with it.
[00:39:13] But I am a really good business guy.
[00:39:15] Yeah.
[00:39:15] And I always sell from the heart.
[00:39:18] I also have heart.
[00:39:19] I like the, there's a, I don't know if it's Jim Rome or I want to,
[00:39:24] I really would love to quote properly cite this person who's created it or said this.
[00:39:28] But, but I've heard this if you give other people what they want, you will give,
[00:39:32] you will get everything you want.
[00:39:34] Yeah.
[00:39:34] Zinc Ziggler.
[00:39:35] Zinc Ziggler.
[00:39:35] Yes.
[00:39:36] Yeah.
[00:39:36] Yeah.
[00:39:37] Do help people get what they want and they'll get what you want.
[00:39:40] It's, and that's how I live my, I've lived my life.
[00:39:42] Every business of every own has been the exact same thing.
[00:39:45] Yeah.
[00:39:45] So how do I, how do I people with youth, they're close because then you're not selling anything.
[00:39:50] Right.
[00:39:51] Like I never ever, and I'll be a little bit sure to be in sales person.
[00:39:54] I am.
[00:39:55] I really, really get at it.
[00:39:56] You know why?
[00:39:57] Because I don't sell anything.
[00:39:59] Because people don't like to be sold.
[00:40:01] No, I was, I had, I do a Monday morning match to my here in my office.
[00:40:05] And we just had this one of my previous, and they want to do scripture.
[00:40:08] And they're going, I can't teach you scripts.
[00:40:11] I've not a script.
[00:40:12] I do bullet points and I talk to people like human being.
[00:40:15] And I'll say, well, if you do this today, will you do that?
[00:40:19] No, I saw who was that.
[00:40:22] Brian Tracy is one of those guys back in the 80s.
[00:40:26] Yeah.
[00:40:26] And I'm like, that is so not me.
[00:40:30] Is like using this clothes and that clothes.
[00:40:32] I'm like, yeah, why not just be human being?
[00:40:35] The worst, the one I, the one I dislike is the, would you like to meet tomorrow at two or Friday at three?
[00:40:42] You're like, okay, just ask them when they're free.
[00:40:44] Like it's not that big of a deal.
[00:40:46] Yeah, it's just Tom Hopkins, by the way.
[00:40:48] Yeah.
[00:40:49] But the reality is, you know, I'm on a mission.
[00:40:52] I have, um, you know, 63.
[00:40:54] I don't know how many more years I have left.
[00:40:56] In fact, my general manager is my assistant for 19 years.
[00:40:58] She's like, why are you doing all this?
[00:41:00] Why are you studying a coaching business at 63 years old?
[00:41:03] And I just don't feel like I've impacted or not people.
[00:41:07] In the mistake I made the last 20 years, I've been coaching against the 20 years.
[00:41:10] I was coaching mostly new agents and none of them did the work.
[00:41:14] And I'll give you an example.
[00:41:15] Last year I did 250 coaching goals, different agents, five did the work.
[00:41:20] Wow.
[00:41:21] And they were all newer and so on jet on December 31st.
[00:41:24] I gave up new agents.
[00:41:26] So if you're new agents up there, I'm the wrong coach for you.
[00:41:28] I will not coach you.
[00:41:30] 
[00:41:30] Yeah.
[00:41:30] And that's what I realized that I've been coaching the wrong people.
[00:41:33] I want to teach successful people how do you unbelievably wicked awesome
[00:41:38] success.
[00:41:39] Yeah.
[00:41:40] Right.
[00:41:40] And that's like reading freedom and how they actually run it.
[00:41:43] How do you build your foundation?
[00:41:45] How do you hire the right people to leverage yourself?
[00:41:48] How do you contract agents that paid 50% right?
[00:41:51] And then I'm still hating you for it.
[00:41:53] How do you do all that?
[00:41:54] I'm really successful business where you're being a good dad.
[00:41:58] You know, I'm an agent locally 20 years old.
[00:42:01] And it's just proves my point.
[00:42:02] Yeah.
[00:42:03] 20 years old, a one year old and a four year old working 100 hours.
[00:42:07] Equipment style working on me.
[00:42:08] Now he has cancer and he's made out making.
[00:42:12] But his business is running really well right now, even though he's in the hospital.
[00:42:15] And he's gone.
[00:42:16] Wow.
[00:42:17] Because I talk a lot of other business.
[00:42:19] And so he's still going to sell 25 homes this year from being sick.
[00:42:23] Well, and you know, and again, I, it's a horrible thing and, and hopefully he,
[00:42:28] he makes a speedy recovery.
[00:42:30] And the fact that his business is running helps his stress level, which has to help
[00:42:35] his cancer treatments.
[00:42:37] I mean, this is, we're talking about physical health as well.
[00:42:40] We're not just talking about time.
[00:42:42] You know, physical health is a thing.
[00:42:44] And we need to, we need to take very good care of that.
[00:42:47] Yeah.
[00:42:47] The, the, the reason I get my brokerage was 56.
[00:42:52] And you know, you can't solve brokerage.
[00:42:55] That's kind of a funny way they said the terms.
[00:42:57] I'm not going to get that whole joke that I went through.
[00:43:00] But I was, my dad died at 50, but my mom got a 50.
[00:43:03] Almost all my relatives.
[00:43:05] Wow.
[00:43:06] In what else?
[00:43:06] 56.
[00:43:07] My stress levels to the roof.
[00:43:10] I broke into, you know, and because you're, you're chasing people to be successful as a broker.
[00:43:18] And the easiest people to bring on is a brokerage is due agents.
[00:43:22] So we spend our time doing that.
[00:43:24] Even though we know 86% are going to fail, we do that.
[00:43:28] And I broke into 500 agents to get 50 good ones.
[00:43:32] Oh, I, I could, I told, I could do that.
[00:43:35] I could give you even bigger numbers for me.
[00:43:38] Meaning we've had the same experience.
[00:43:40] Yeah.
[00:43:40] Well, it's what it is.
[00:43:41] And then it is the worst type of, you know this is, I asked because I took on all
[00:43:46] brand new agents ago.
[00:43:47] That was my thing.
[00:43:48] I'm not bringing on brand new agents.
[00:43:48] I'm going to change their lives, right?
[00:43:50] For me, 10 years to figure out, I'm never going to change in my life.
[00:43:54] I mean, I changed something like that.
[00:43:57] And, but what I realized is I bit in the sounds horrible.
[00:44:01] I don't mean to do.
[00:44:02] I didn't learn to base my business based on mediocrity.
[00:44:06] And that was a hard thing to do.
[00:44:07] The swallow tract on everybody wanted to hear.
[00:44:09] Yeah.
[00:44:10] But I will tell you that if I still had my brokerage today, I'd be dead.
[00:44:13] I really, I wouldn't be dead.
[00:44:15] It would have killed me.
[00:44:16] My dad died of heart disease stress.
[00:44:19] And my stress levels, he actually came to me.
[00:44:21] It's kind of weird, but he came to me and he sitting on a plane.
[00:44:24] He'd been dead for 20 years.
[00:44:26] And I knew he died from stress.
[00:44:28] And I was freaking out.
[00:44:30] I was working 100 hours a week trying to get people from here to here, just that medium, right?
[00:44:36] And so I put on some headphones, fight home first class from Denver.
[00:44:40] I have to help you.
[00:44:41] I wasn't stoned because it personally, guys, potten Denver.
[00:44:44] And I heard a voice.
[00:44:46] I was listening to music and a voice.
[00:44:48] Your expectations and up their expectations.
[00:44:51] Three times I heard that voice and I took my headphones off like shit.
[00:44:55] And I realized it was my dad talking to me, say, you're going to die.
[00:44:58] If you start living by expecting them to be like you, it was probably the biggest
[00:45:03] lesson I teach.
[00:45:04] I didn't know all my speaking gigs right now with this, I do a longer version of this.
[00:45:08] I do a limited time.
[00:45:10] But your expectations are the cause of almost all your disappointment.
[00:45:14] I couldn't that is such a powerful statement.
[00:45:17] Let's say it again, your expectations are the, are the cause of all of the challenges
[00:45:23] you're currently facing.
[00:45:24] Almost all your disappointments.
[00:45:26] And I'm talking about from family to customers to friends.
[00:45:30] I that day, that moment I took those headphones off.
[00:45:34] I rewrote my entire business model.
[00:45:37] And I said, you know what?
[00:45:38] I'm going to be happy wherever they're happy.
[00:45:40] But I didn't just do it there.
[00:45:42] I did it my entire life.
[00:45:43] I have no expectations of my life, no expectations of my kids.
[00:45:47] You know, I personally expectations I control me.
[00:45:50] Yeah.
[00:45:51] I can control that.
[00:45:52] But I can't control.
[00:45:54] I can't want you more than you want for you.
[00:45:58] Yeah.
[00:45:58] And and right.
[00:46:01] We think, you know, oftentimes our own drive and motivation can be transferred or can
[00:46:06] be taught.
[00:46:06] And you know, maybe if the stars lined up, maybe it could with one person,
[00:46:12] but you'd go through several hundred.
[00:46:14] You know, and I totally agree.
[00:46:17] There's this idea of not having expectations.
[00:46:18] You actually demonstrated this earlier in this conversation.
[00:46:22] I just want to highlight earlier, Mitch was talking about the very beginning.
[00:46:25] He was talking about your contact list.
[00:46:27] And he says, you know, we know that 11 out of every hundred contacts you have
[00:46:31] are going to need a REALTOR.
[00:46:32] And you know, in the next 12 months or whatever that stat is.
[00:46:35] Mitch goes, I use seven because I want to set the expectation low.
[00:46:39] And you even said that.
[00:46:40] I want to set the expectation low and then, then, you know, rise above it.
[00:46:46] Because if you can go, Hey, if I only get seven out of out of a hundred,
[00:46:50] I can, maybe I can have a really nice life.
[00:46:52] I don't have to shoot for, for, you know, this perfect 11, right?
[00:46:57] 
[00:46:58] And I use everything.
[00:47:00] So I'll give you the other way.
[00:47:01] I use expectations, inspections.
[00:47:02] I have not lost to be into inspections in 14 years.
[00:47:06] It is like, it's also, so DJ, let me explain to you our inspection.
[00:47:10] They're going to find 40 or 50 things wrong with the house.
[00:47:13] And the seller's not going to fix any of them.
[00:47:15] So, you know, so then when they have an inspection contact, 15 or 20 things wrong,
[00:47:19] like, oh, not to bad.
[00:47:21] The seller, I say the same day, I say, look, they're going to find 40 or 50 things wrong.
[00:47:24] And the buyer's going to want most of the things.
[00:47:27] So when they come back and they only want four or five things fixed, it's awesome.
[00:47:33] Expectations, I love this.
[00:47:34] And what you're doing is you're, you're, you're really setting this, this, the table for here's what's going to happen.
[00:47:42] And then when it happens, there's fewer surprises.
[00:47:46] There's, oh, this is, we expected this.
[00:47:48] This is, oh, and we're going to overshoot in some ways, these expectations or under shoot,
[00:47:53] depending on what, you know, how it would benefit the relationship.
[00:47:56] And then we're going to proceed from there and people go, like, oh, thank you for telling me.
[00:48:00] The worst thing is when a REALTOR has a client that goes, what's next?
[00:48:04] What are we doing next?
[00:48:05] Right?
[00:48:05] The expectation hasn't been set.
[00:48:07] So, so for your, for your people, let's see, I want you to think about a couple of things.
[00:48:11] And this is really emotional part because when, but I tell you that I didn't see my kids grow up, it's,
[00:48:17] I can tell you I talk about it.
[00:48:19] It's my biggest only regret in my life.
[00:48:22] And I want you to go home with size of the mirror thing.
[00:48:25] I want you to go home and talk to your spouse, if you ever spouse.
[00:48:29] And I want you to ask them how to say love and business.
[00:48:32] And I guarantee you they hate the business.
[00:48:35] There's a great video out there.
[00:48:36] If you want to really watch a good video, if you go to YouTube and tap the Mitch Reback,
[00:48:40] Chinat, I always think Chinat is an interview for my wife, but what she saw, what she hated real estate.
[00:48:47] Because I was working 100 hours a week as a president.
[00:48:50] I've never had any conversation with her once.
[00:48:51] She's talking away because I want to talk.
[00:48:55] And 10 minutes of the conversation, it's like, you haven't heard of where to sit.
[00:48:58] Did you? I go, no, not a word.
[00:49:01] And I knew something had to change, but I did.
[00:49:03] But there's the other thing I want you to think about if you have kids, because again, there's no going back.
[00:49:07] My kids are all between 41 and 45 right now.
[00:49:09] There's no going back there.
[00:49:10] Probably the reason why I only work 35 hours a week now because I have four grandkids and that's my life.
[00:49:15] That's way more important than all my money.
[00:49:18] But kids don't love TIN and eat.
[00:49:22] Yeah.
[00:49:23] And I'm not talking about being there.
[00:49:25] I'm talking about being present when you're there.
[00:49:27] So now we didn't have supple back then.
[00:49:30] Right?
[00:49:30] In the 80s and 90s.
[00:49:31] But I have my brain.
[00:49:33] My brain was always thinking about something else.
[00:49:35] Now you go, I got on my grandson's baseball player.
[00:49:37] I got on the baseball game.
[00:49:38] I don't miss it.
[00:49:39] I'll fly home anywhere to be home for his baseball game.
[00:49:42] I miss I went to the small two year, but I don't miss that.
[00:49:44] But anyway, I will tell you that the majority of parents are sitting there on their phones.
[00:49:50] Right?
[00:49:51] I didn't think my phone would be to my car.
[00:49:52] Yeah.
[00:49:53] Yeah.
[00:49:54] Yeah.
[00:49:54] And I go to dinner with my wife.
[00:49:56] I don't take my phone to the restaurant.
[00:49:57] We my girlfriend and I have the same policy.
[00:50:00] But because it's so easy to want to do that.
[00:50:03] And there's always something to look at on your phone.
[00:50:05] There's always a notification.
[00:50:06] There's always an email, a text, whatever.
[00:50:08] And we say, you know, let's let's not be interrupted.
[00:50:11] And we do that when we watch television.
[00:50:13] That's another thing.
[00:50:14] Television movies.
[00:50:16] When we're talking and we're planning our week.
[00:50:18] Yeah.
[00:50:18] No cell phones.
[00:50:19] I agree.
[00:50:19] And the other part that is even your voice mail.
[00:50:22] Is wrong.
[00:50:23] I'm guessing.
[00:50:24] So you have to set the boundaries.
[00:50:26] Yeah.
[00:50:27] How many doctors can you call it 10 o'clock?
[00:50:29] And hey, my heart is a work.
[00:50:30] Right?
[00:50:31] Not too many.
[00:50:32] Right?
[00:50:32] Yeah.
[00:50:32] So you set the boundaries and one of my good friends is a big white Jesus and San Diego.
[00:50:37] Pete Milton.
[00:50:38] He's his, his, his wife.
[00:50:40] If you're calling you after six o'clock, I will call you back to the next business day.
[00:50:44] Right?
[00:50:45] I used to tell my customers because I didn't work Sundays.
[00:50:47] I almost died in 2004 and I stopped working Sundays at that point.
[00:50:51] I'm going to work as working Sundays, the, you know, 16 hour days.
[00:50:55] So I stopped working when that happened.
[00:50:57] I just got married three months earlier.
[00:50:58] And I'm like, you know what?
[00:50:59] I'm not working Sundays anymore.
[00:51:01] And I say, look, you have me from eight to eight Monday through Saturday on Sundays.
[00:51:05] My family day, if you can't be stuck that on the wrong bill to play.
[00:51:08] Yeah.
[00:51:08] Never lost the customer.
[00:51:10] And I said, I have lots of bills in there working that if you need to see a property.
[00:51:14] I'll show you now.
[00:51:15] Someone came to me with a million dollar property.
[00:51:16] Wanted to look at.
[00:51:17] I still showed them a property of something.
[00:51:19] But the reality is I would bet you after 2004 that was it.
[00:51:23] July to celebrate that you I work.
[00:51:26] By Sunday.
[00:51:28] Wow.
[00:51:30] Amazing.
[00:51:31] Well, the book is the big lie.
[00:51:33] And we're going to have a link to that on.
[00:51:35] You can find it on Amazon.
[00:51:36] You can find it really anywhere.
[00:51:37] Books are sold.
[00:51:38] We're going to have a direct link to that and all of Mitch's books.
[00:51:40] Also, if you want to have Mitch speak or you interested in his coaching,
[00:51:45] Mitch reback.com is where you go.
[00:51:48] That's our I B a K M I T C H R I B A K dot com.
[00:51:53] Mitch is dynamic.
[00:51:54] He's an amazing speaker.
[00:51:55] He's, you know, more than anything.
[00:51:57] He's proven to be successful, not just in real estate, but in many other industries
[00:52:02] by applying the exact same principles.
[00:52:04] So I know for me, it was funny.
[00:52:06] Mitch, as you were talking, what I do is I actually recruit REALTORS.
[00:52:09] I don't, I don't practice.
[00:52:10] I have a license, but I don't use it.
[00:52:11] But I recruit REALTORS and I'm realizing I was doing some of it wrong.
[00:52:15] I am going to apply your exact principles to some of the some of the recruiting
[00:52:19] techniques that I use or the really it's all follow up.
[00:52:23] So all the follow up techniques and you are absolutely right.
[00:52:26] And I am what I'm going to be waiting for is for that broker to say, you know,
[00:52:30] or that we call them brokers in old.
[00:52:31] I've had agent that agent to say, hey, you know, I'm a little disappointed with my
[00:52:36] firm or something went wrong and they screwed up or I don't like them anymore.
[00:52:39] And again, if they're getting that regular messaging for me and phone calls as well,
[00:52:43] and other things.
[00:52:44] I'm going to be the one that's most a
[00:52:48] politely aggressively in a polite way saying, I want you, I want you, I want you.
[00:52:52] And then whenever that opportunity comes up, hopefully they'll
[00:52:54] give it a tip on that.
[00:52:56] So I want to think, so that's my business to the.
[00:53:00] So one of the things that I do that works is I give them content.
[00:53:05] Yeah.
[00:53:05] So I have a Monday, every Monday tip of the week.
[00:53:09] Yep.
[00:53:09] It goes out to my Mr.
[00:53:11] David's and not with me.
[00:53:12] And I don't push you know, coaching let me know because my coaching,
[00:53:16] I don't charge my agents anything.
[00:53:18] You know, for coaching, obviously.
[00:53:20] And so I give you two chances to work.
[00:53:22] We can join me at the XP or you can thank my coach and I'll give you a chance.
[00:53:27] And I'm not a, I'm not a digressier.
[00:53:29] I'm sure you would better recruit.
[00:53:30] I'm even with my brokerage.
[00:53:32] I was never a recruiter.
[00:53:33] Like I literally never, I never picked up the phone once.
[00:53:36] Even with the XP, I think I called two people.
[00:53:40] And actually I have 22 other people now.
[00:53:42] By the way, I call two people, I'm just that's not who I am.
[00:53:46] You know, you live within who you are and I'm a contribution guy.
[00:53:50] Let me help you get whatever you want.
[00:53:52] Maybe you'll join me.
[00:53:53] Maybe you won't.
[00:53:54] And if you do great, you don't, that's okay to have a good laugh.
[00:53:57] 
[00:53:58] I love it.
[00:53:58] Mitch, thank you.
[00:53:59] On behalf of the audience, you gave so many, not just great actual tactical strategies,
[00:54:04] but also ways to think about your life, your business and, you know,
[00:54:10] taking a hard look in the mirror and saying, okay, what's not going well in my life right now?
[00:54:15] And everyone's got something that's not going well in their life at all times.
[00:54:18] The trick is to know what it is.
[00:54:20] So if you know what it is, you can work on it, but you can't work on it if you don't have time.
[00:54:25] And time is really what Mitch is aiming to give you back.
[00:54:29] You want more time with your family, your friends, yourself, you know,
[00:54:33] volunteer opportunities.
[00:54:33] Whatever you want to do in life, you need time to do that.
[00:54:37] And this is a job that that can, if you treat it like a job,
[00:54:42] it could eat up your time.
[00:54:43] If you treat it like your own business and you really run it like an entrepreneur,
[00:54:47] then hopefully it will give you back more of that time.
[00:54:49] And you can continue to make a good living.
[00:54:52] 
[00:54:52] So just one last thing I can talk about it.
[00:54:56] I want your mindset to be invested $250,000 in a style in real estate business, not $1,500.
[00:55:03] Nobody cares about $1,500.
[00:55:05] Right.
[00:55:05] But if you invested $250,000, what would you do differently?
[00:55:08] I guarantee the word is everything.
[00:55:11] Yeah.
[00:55:11] It's a great point.
[00:55:13] It's a great point.
[00:55:14] So start now.
[00:55:15] This is a great time with the NAR settlement.
[00:55:18] Sort of sort of pushing a lot of agents out because they're ones.
[00:55:23] E2's the agents, they're leaving.
[00:55:25] They, I will tell you, we have a holding company here for people that don't practice.
[00:55:28] It's for the whole state of Illinois.
[00:55:30] We're the largest one in the state.
[00:55:31] We have 1100 agents in there and we added 300 of them since the NAR settlement.
[00:55:39] That is how quickly people are exiting.
[00:55:41] So what a great thing for everyone listening because you can pick up their clients.
[00:55:45] Prospect, prospect, prospect, follow, follow,
[00:55:47] follow, Mitch is the guy to learn how to do all of those things and run a successful
[00:55:51] business along the way and maybe figure out how to compensate people like Mitch was doing,
[00:55:57] where you're paying them a flat fee for various tasks.
[00:55:59] You're focusing on the things you like and that are business building for you.
[00:56:04] And you know, Mitch is going to show you exactly how to do that.
[00:56:06] Check out the book, The Big Live.
[00:56:08] Link to that in the show notes.
[00:56:09] Mitch, on behalf of everyone, thank you again, really loved having you on.

And I want to tell you more about Mitch. He has this really long and impressive career. We're going to be really learning from a lot of his wisdom today. But Mitch has been an entrepreneur since the age of 19. And check this out. This is incredible. He's owned 23 different businesses in 18 different industries. He was the first online dating service and the third paintball business in the US. Now over the years, he's been in the restaurant business, flowers, advertising, marketing, call centers, and now real estate among many other industries. Currently, Rich Mitch runs tropical beach sidebroker by EXPs in Florida with over 150 agents in Brevard County, Florida, and a total number of agents of 2,000 across the United States. Oh, actually, beyond the United States, not just the United States in seven countries, including the United States, almost as agents and almost every one of the US states, missing one. I'm curious which one he doesn't have. We'll have to see one of our listeners maybe can sign up with them and then he can get the full 50. But TRB, his company tropical beach sidebroker is been in the top 10 real estate brokerages since the opening the doors in 20 2005 tropical beach sidebrealt. He averages 800 plus transactions per year. That is impressive. Mitch became a REALTOR in 2001, quickly became successful through multiple avenues, including open houses and the internet. In 2008, Mitch published his first book, 100 mile per hour marketing for real estate and it quickly shot to number one in real estate books. In 2015, Mitch's second book, so you have your real estate license now. What is selling extremely well throughout North America. Mitch has a new book called The Big Lie, which we are going to talk about today as well. Mitch currently speaks throughout North America on a variety of subjects, including internet marketing and lead conversion inside sales agents, mindset, open houses, sphere of influence, expectations, and how to kick off your career in real estate among other subjects. Mitch currently lives in Merritt Island, Florida with his wife, Jeanette. They have four grown children and for beautiful grandchildren, Lola, Henry, Cash and Logan. I want everybody to check out Mitch's website, which is Mitch Rebek.com. That's R-I-B-A-K. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. We will also have a link to all of Mitch's books and also everything Mitch related with social media as well. So check that out. Mitch, welcome to the show. Hey, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. Very excited to talk about it. I sound the most important there. It's crazy. Well, you are an important person, and I'm excited that I always find that the most important people, for the most part, tend to be the most humble as well. So we're glad to have you on the show. Tell us, gosh, you've done so many things, and you've done things before real estate. I know you've done things after you're still in real estate, and you're also owning businesses outside of real estate. But tell us like how and why did you get into real estate? Desperation broke. So like you said, I was the first online dating service, which was a lot of fun. I had a at asquitch.com, which is my advice column. I had a asquitch to date Dr. Radio Show on 45 radio stations. Six million people a month can be going to our sites. And then the contract for ridiculous amount of money because that's what we did back in the the.com boom right? Sure. And too much before we were supposed to close, now as you tired you have 40 years old, the in-appable burst and started by $82 million and I lost. I was a bad couple days. And still ran the business until we ran out of money, but after that there was no more raising money in the internet. And so my buddy Joe was a developer from the boss. He's like, Mitch, get your real estate license. I'm like, no, I don't like REALTORS. Why would I do that? He'd be good at it. I don't want to do that. I literally had three months with a remedy left. So I got my real estate license and honestly, it's probably the easiest thing I've ever done besides paintball. Meaning I sold 36 homes in my first year, 50, my second, 80, my third and fourth years since that my team and I started my brokerage. And I don't understand not selling homes because I find it very simple. So we can have some conversations about that, but ultimately it's what you get this because you get what you put into it, right? Yeah. I think it's a very fair business in that sense where if you're willing to put in the effort, I think the path to success, well there's many paths to success as a real estate agent, but those paths have been well-trot and they are well-defined. You can read books. You can watch YouTube videos. You can hire coaches. You can join a brokerage that will assist you. It can be done. And it can be done whether you brand new to a city and you just moved and you have no sphere of influence or you live there your whole life. I am curious for you when you say it's the easiest part that the easiest thing you've done, why do you think you found it so doable? Well, I have a suspicion of why you found it easier than maybe other people would find it. And I suspect, and I want you to correct me if I'm wrong, but I suspect it's because you understand how to run businesses. Yeah, well, I'm an entrepreneur. So yeah, I walked in my first day of the brokerage and my broker the time said, just so you know, I don't do any training at all, but all the things follow up follow up follow up, which by the way, it was a blessing. So on day one, I wrote my business plan. I didn't know anything different. I didn't know real estate's don't write business plans. So day one, I wrote my business plan. Day two is 9-11. So we kind of stopped that thing. Sure. very right today. Um, I think bout of пока dad is we're going to be using带 powers. We have self-criticism which means that systems in think into the world, we have stronger and more Indian people who know our damn. So now I want to say that my local sitting together. If I had a big question about am I, why am they nothing more standard carυers? sales cycle generate needs, their children needs, close the lead and create a customer for life. I don't care what product you sell. That's the cycle for sure. So I knew all this stuff going in. So I had a little advantage over your average person who was a teacher or a bartender or whatever they did, prior. But I knew how to generate needs. I knew I didn't know anybody. Everybody told me, don't do open house and don't do internet, 2001. So open houses, I said, if you're told me not to do that, but people are coming to me. How can that be a bad thing? I'm getting leads. Yeah. And the same thing with internet. My background was internet being the first online dating service. So I would not do that. So I did, and I went my first contract and five days in and I started in September that January had nine closings. Wow. And so one of the things I learned, and I started this from day one, not knowing to do this, but my January first is actually November first. And what I've learned is during November, December almost every real time, no quiz. They hit their, they go into hibernation. Well, they hit their goal and they're stopped. I'm going to take a break. Well, they did hit their goal. They won't hit it. So they take a break. They take a break. And it's a holiday that I learned. Why not sell during November, December. So I started off with a massive amount of sales. And so I started by your going strong. So I didn't have any doubt. Like, if you build a really good system, you don't have mountains. I had two months of my entire selling career, where I didn't have sales. It's incredible. Because you were always focused on lead gen and nurturing and follow up. And that can be done really any day of the year, no matter what's happening. Yeah, maybe, you know, obviously 9-11 probably wouldn't have been the right day, but aside from a major catastrophe like that, any day of the, any day of the year, you can prospect whether it's, you know, and again, holidays excluded maybe. But you can even do it maybe on the holidays. But certainly, you're right. We have agents. They shut down. They tend to shut down at the later part of the year. You know, there's not as much activity, which is what they'll say. There's not as many buyers, not as many sellers. People aren't as motivated. And yet, the people I know who are the most successful don't stop. They really, it's just like, okay, they just pivot. And they just do different things between, you know, November and December. And yeah, and the rest of us, it's really a great time to pick up market share, I think, because so many agents are going to take it easy. Yeah, well, that's what they do. They, you know, it's kind of, again, these are what I brought the book, I have the big lie. It's kind of what we're talking. It's really slow in November, December. So that's when you rebuild your systems and get all this stuff going. And of course, then you start working in January. You have your first contract late January, February, you'll be first picked to late February. And then I was like, you know, as a brokerage, I was the central bank of REALTORS for every, every January, because then my wealth is work. And then it's going to have our five grand, I can't pay my mortgage. Yeah, you know, and this really leads us into what I think, you know, again, you're obviously a skilled salesperson. And I don't, I know that can even be sort of seen as a negative connotation these days, because we think sometimes salespeople are not, you know, maybe not the most, you know, good feeling people that that we, when we think about it, but Mitch is really what he is is a great visit, a great entrepreneur and a great lead generator. And I heard Brian, I think it was Brian Tracy said many, many years ago, and 20 years ago, I heard him in a conference and he said, just so you know, for all your business owners, prospecting solves all problems. And, you know, and of course, that's not absolutely true, but it's pretty close, absolutely true, because if you have, you know, you could be a terrible REALTOR, you could never improve your skills. And if all you did was double the number of prospects that you have in your database, you will double your business. Just, I mean, assuming, assuming you would. And that's a pretty interesting thing. So you don't, of course, you want to improve your skills as well. But if you just double your, double your prospecting, you should double your income. Well, here's what I've realized a few years ago. There's one common alley for every business that I've owned. It is building the foundation. What's the foundation? Who's my customer? Where are they? Yeah. Every business I've ever brought. And I didn't have that blessing here because I did know he looks at my girlfriend. But this most of the REALTORS I meet within train, they have more context in their cell phone, they'll ever need the rest of their life. I couldn't, I could not agree with you more. And I want to, I want to just say this in case it just slipped by and people didn't hear it. What Mitch just said is, in Mitch has 2000 agents. So this is not something he's not just like, well, just works for Mitch. No, no, Mitch is, this is what Mitch teaches everybody. It's the reason why he's been so successful. Everybody listening right now has more contacts in their database. Then, then they probably need, because a certain percentage of those people are going to transact in real estate every single year. And you want to, of course, be the person they think about. And the numbers actually seven out of a hundred. So we know the number that's been around for a lot of years. They actually say a lot of, but I like to say I like to set expectations low. Sure. But, but the reality is, so I'll give you an example. I have 2000 contacts in my phone. I would equate to 140 sales a share. Now, you have to go back and say, why does someone use you as a REALTOR? And there's only one reason. Right? So I'll ask that I need a class of a thousand people recently. And I asked that not one person got it right. The only week. Can I guess? Yeah. Okay. My guess is the reason why they chose you is they trust you. See, I'm wrong. Okay. Tell me why they chose you. They only use you because you happen to be in front of them. And that they keep our binders. You know what? That is absolutely true. That's it. And so because I stopped selling a few years ago, I really got to look at the business completely different. Now, I have, I've always was working in the, I was just as guilty. That's where I get my room at the book, but where he in the business, not on the business. And when I step back three years ago from selling. And by the way, I was always in front of my people twice a month. And I would get 40 to 80 calls every year to sell home. Now, I didn't sell that because I didn't want to. Right? But I got that many the day I stopped, which is October 2021. The next year, I got six phone calls this year. I've got three. Because I stopped doing it. I don't want to sell it anymore. Now, I might go back and build a referral company for the front of it because I'm an entrepreneur. I have to do stuff. But, um, but the reality is that's the reason. So once you know that, then you have to scientifically. It's made up work. And you have to figure out what's the right response. We've tested all this the years now. We've learned if you said once a once a week, it's too much. Yeah. If you said once a month or so, that's when we came up with the every other week. Yeah, it's if you are dripping on people every other week. And I imagine does this include all forms of communication? This could be email tax. That's just that's just email. Just email. So emailing every two weeks with something of value. So there's only two things. The only two things you said to him. This is so simple, my boy. I love it. The first email that goes out is the market update because it's different every month than people will look at it. Most of us will send these newsletters to nobody cares about it. Right. That's true. Do you read newsletters? If you're watching this day, do you read newsletters? I did a presentation once called nobody wants to read your newsletter. Right. So the first one is that. And then the second one, two weeks letters to top 10 things out is my top 10 things to do in the very coming. Okay. This is a brilliant thing. So I'm here in Chicago. I apologize. I don't want you to steal your thunder, but Mitch is so absolutely dead on. I have a friend of Cole. She's I wish she was one of our brokers. She isn't, but she's a friend of mine here in Chicago. We have 47,000 agents in the in the area. She's the only I'm sure there's a few others that do it. But the only one I know and I know I know a lot of those agents. The only one that does top. She does top five things to do this weekend in the city of Chicago in the suburbs. Kind of you know, and I look forward to it every week because I actually plan my weekends with it. So this is such a brilliant idea. I'm so glad you do that. So last last agent I talked to do this at her first four months, got six or six and four buyers out of a database of only 400. Wow. Yeah. So so again, it goes back to building your foundation, which unfortunately most brokers don't know that either. Yeah. Right. And nothing gets broken. So it's just that one of the lot of companies you learn by losing millions of millions of millions of dollars. How to be good. Yeah. Well, you have to be willing to fail too, right? You have to be willing to try things and and you know, and again, it's not really a failure, but not getting the result that you wanted and then going, OK, how do I? It's only way we learn is through through mistakes, right? And testing is really important. So when I started out again, being with the optional backup, I didn't do things for a week until I didn't work. My minimum test was six months. Yeah. But everything is when I'm mastered open houses and I never sold less than 24 homes in a year from open houses. I was between 24 and 30 homes. I just mastered it. And I came up with different things. I, oh, if I do this, this will happen. What if than this, right? And it came really simple and became a lot of things. So the blessing of not being any training, everything that I, I, I developed, I developed like internet leak conversion. When I was the first person doing post registration in January 2002, I started my first website. And nobody was doing post registration. Right. Yeah, we was right. That's true. I had so many REALTORS yell at me. I can't believe you make people register on your site. I'm like, I can't believe you don't. Yeah, right. Right. This is we want their information. So they said, well, I said 50% of the people who are registering. They're like, what about the other 85% of like what about it? Yeah, local sublimation. I'm going to maximize that 15%. So it's just thinking differently. So that was, you know, when I looked back at my business over the last year, the last 23 years, I'm in the business. The thing I, the common thing I think the people that we see is successful in our business. Our successful selling homes, but they're not successful in business. Yeah, there's a lot of top producers that I suspect. They don't often share this. Although some of them have shared this even on this show is that they could have the highest production year. Ever. Maybe it's selling 80 homes or more and they're like, I didn't make any money. And, and that's shocking, but it's something to think about because maybe they're overspending or they're not managing the finances. Whatever. Well, they're not running a business, but, you know, I said earlier, we're talking before the show is, you know, most people don't look happy job. They might own their copy job. And, but that's not just real. So it's everybody I know every call business guy doesn't really want to business. They have a copy job. Right. And they get better. And they get better. And they're better than I thought. It's just reality. So to be when I look back at my friends at the selling age, I was selling it. I had a copy job for the 80 or 100 hours week. And I was making good money. Couple to 300,000 dollars a year. But the reality is I had my life. You know, it's all came to fruition when I turned 60. And I look back at my life. I said, we do that every 10 years of your life, right? And I look back and say, I cannot tell you five things to take you with my kids. When they're growing up in that works. Sure. And there's a lot of you out there right now that are in your 30s and 40s or 20s. They have little kids. That's your most important job. Right. Your businesses, your business, if you want to business. But your most important job is not to do what I did. That's my future. It's why I wrote the book. I wrote this book in 90 days. My last two books took me two years each. I did this in 90 days because I've locked out four hours a day to write. Yeah. So I can make sure I give this book out because I didn't post on social media. Just talking about that. About how most people build copy jobs. And I got 262 responses. Wow. And everybody was in pain. And so people said, Mitch, what are you teaching now? I mean, I can teach all this stuff to sell houses. But really when I teach this to each other, get freedom. Yeah. Let's talk about that. So the book is the big lie. Let's tell us what is the big lie. Okay. So the big lie is sell out of homes. And you'll be successful. And once you do that, start a team. Yeah. And they don't tell you you're going to start a big city job. And then because you need to get more split because you're not making money as a team. You start a brokerage. Right. And it's all ego based. Like I know so many of my friends, why I adore who will not listen to me because I'm the guy. About my own my brokerage with 120 agents. You know, I was the guy that's really feels good, right? That doesn't pay your bills. It feels good. Sure. So I see these guys. I'll give it an example of one of my friends. He does about eight or 100 homes every year. And he works at least a hundred hours a week. And there's a reason why there's a hamster on the cover of my book. And I said, why are you doing that? How many people are you doing the buyers? He goes, have. I go, why are you showing property? Well, my customers trust me. I go, why are you showing property? He doesn't, he doesn't get it. And he still doesn't get it by way. He won't listen. I can't fix that. But I have a lot of people who fix him right now. Right now, I have 16s over the middle of the middle of the transformer into the modern team model that we teach him. So what I realized early on is what are my superpowers? My superpowers, I'm really good at actually really, really good at negotiating. I'm really, really good at finding the house, which I still don't do. It's kind of fun. And I'm really, really good at making sure it closes. It doesn't mean I do all those jobs, by the way. This is a really good recording. So when I talk to my customers, because this is the pushback, I get from agents. Well, my customers trust me like he said earlier. Sure. I go, yeah, but they trust you to make sure they get the best deal possible. And they close. Anybody can open doors. So when I talk to a customer and say, DJ, let me explain how I run my business. By the way, you'll never hear me say, how I do my job. Josh, be crazy. Right? That's how it is. I don't explain how I run my business. So my superpower is a negotiate, finding your home, negotiate the best deal you'll ever get. And making sure it closes. I'm really, really good at it. I'm not really good at it. I'm really, really good at it. And I go, what I don't do is I don't show property. So I want to make sure something's available. So you probably, when you want to see it. Anybody can open the doors, right? Absolutely. And I wait till they say that. Because they don't say that I'm going to continue on that road. They've never not said it. By the way, everybody says yes. And I'm always saying anybody's short, right? They also because people know when they walk into a home and it's the right home. They know. They don't say maybe they need a little push here and there, but typically speaking, they know. Yeah, this is very little sales. The sales is prospecting. Right? Like we talked about earlier. Yes. Right? That's the sales of this. This is. So when you really break down the numbers, I'm the numbers guy. My average agent when I had my team was working five thousand of dips. I negotiated all the deals. My sister wrote all the authors. They went to they show property went to the inspection with the closing. Every five hours on a $400,000 sale. That meant I was taking them $1,000 an hour to show houses. Can I sign up for that? Can I? I'll do that. Right? But that's what everybody does. And here's the worst part. Maybe he said to me. Because I only gave them 50%. Right. You generated the lead and you're paying them $1,000 an hour, but you're right. But you're right. They have the employee mentality. Right. So with my bottom team model, I pay just $25,000 in the show house. Now depending on where they are, I got two teams in California right now. They pay $7,000 in the show house. Sure. So adjusted for living. Yeah. But I pay $75 an hour. And instead of giving them 50%. I mean, $20 an hour. Instead of giving them 50%. I give them 10% bonus. And they're happy. I'm still paying them by the way $250 an hour shows. Right. Right. In the end. But then on my team anymore. They're just agents that I contract to do tasks. And my team consistent myself. An assistant. A an inside sales agent. And a transaction coordinator. That's my team. No more babysitting. Now I didn't have a pushback from an agent last week, which is fun. I love getting pushed back. So much fun. So she goes, well, you're not nice to new agents. I go actually get to stay in the business now. Because I wouldn't have given that to them. I don't know if you're right. Right. So now I'm not talking to you leaders. I'm just about ages of cell 60, 70, 80 plus homes a year. It happened almost all those people almost half of our buy. Are agents almost sure buyers is that actually I get to keep them in the business. It's a number of reason why agents fail is they don't have cash flow. Right. I'm giving them cash flow. So what's I explain? I see actually decided to put you for me. And so what. But what I'm teaching people is now I can run my business from anywhere. Because reality is my system. My system can reach the 19 years. I don't have to do home search. She does something better than I do. Right. She can go to even the gochets better than I do now. But. I don't have to work. I and I can do everything I want from anywhere. If I was still selling now, I would even do listening to this anymore. I'd pay an agent hourly plus a bonus. If they get listening. I give 250 dollars for the. For the listing appointment and. 10% of the gap. Now, would you train them on your listing appointment method? No, we have it. Yeah. So so basically what we're doing is is creating a sort of almost gig economy. Sort of situation where people are doing a task. They're getting paid for a task. And they get a residual if if the deal closes. So the thing that I do is. So, you know, you know, you know, you know, what I do is you're telling. You're setting the expectation to the client. Here's how it works. Here's why I do it this way. Not just. Hey, you're not going to see me until. You know until until the close or close. No, you're intentionally not going to see me because. The most important thing is I get you the highest price. I close the deal. That's what I am best at. So what I'm going to do that. I'm going to I'm going to have my, you know, my, my partners do. I was. I was. I was invited to music, I was invited to music,illingly. And then. Yeah, I, I think that is. Now. Here's a question. and you say you're no longer babysitting. However, what if an agent is late to an appointment? You're made there doing the home showing or they screw up. Like how do you sort of deal with that? Yeah, I haven't had that problem. In all the times I've done it. Now, if it happened, they would never, I'd never use it again. You know, so it's not like, well, I have an agent I have to fire, anything I just never use it again. Sure. You know, and the only thing that, the only other place that I do get involved when they do pick a house before, right? It'd be our private looking house. Yeah. Because I deviate expertise of seeing the leak of the ceiling. Sure. You know, I do have my customers, but we're talking about 15 minutes, right? Half hour maybe. And now you have time for, well, and obviously now your children are growing, but you now have the time that you didn't have when you were younger and they were younger. And it's amazing. You have taught this to people as well. I am curious to hear, because you are going to get pushed back from, sorry, anyone who's got doing 80 deals a year, there's an ego associated with that because they've done it successfully. And whether they're making money or not, they're doing 80 deals a year, which is very impressive to the overall community and also their clients, yet the quality of their life, like you were saying, quality of your life wasn't as good as you wanted it to be. So you're now teaching people, you're really teaching them how to do is have a better quality of life and just work not less, but more specifically on the things that you enjoy doing and then farming out the other things and paying a flat fee per sort of situation. Yeah, and I'm actually talking about working less. So I'm talking about some 80-homes a year working very out a week. Wow. And making a lot more money, because now you're profitable. Yeah. So you're not paying all these people. Excuse me. So to me, again, everybody I know in this business is successful, is not successful in life. And I know that the images are ego in it. Sorry I do that. And by the way, that person's not the person I'm hoping. Right. Just, I'll give you an example. Another example. I had a guy, Revex guy, I helped me suddenly, 62 years old, so you're younger than me. 80 homes a year for the last 35 years. Wow. It's made a ton of money. So he's making money. And when we started talking, I said to him, never get married, never get kids, because he's that guy that, oh, I got to make a, he couldn't do it, right? Right, it's working too much. So I said to him, I go, what are you doing? He said, what do you mean? I go, you know, you're going to die soon, right? He is, he's 62 years old. Yeah. We got 20, 20 years up, really 10 or 15, all the years, right? Sure. I mean, I'm going to look to 142, exactly another 40 years of good life. But the reality is, at least that in crying. Yeah. It was really sad, because he never really took the moment to look back at your life. So here's my, but I want you, everybody listen to this. I want you to do this exercise. I call it the mirror to your success. And I do this every single day. I want you to, when you get off this call, I want you to go in your bathroom, looking at your eye in the mirror, and looking at your eyes, right? Because you cannot lie to yourself. When you're looking at you, you can rationalize, stab you down the screen. But you can't look in your eyes, lie yourself. And I want you to ask yourself, are you really living the life you want in there? Yeah. And you know what, the answer is going to be, it's going to be, of course, yeah. It's going to be, because you're missing your kids, grow up, you're missing your life. And that's what this guy did. And I did, I'm lucky, I'm lucky I've been getting it out at 60 to go forward. And now I travel a time, and I go wait for a month and nobody knows who gone. It's great, because I run businesses, but I really want to save people right now. And I actually have another book I'm writing called The Big Life Entrepreneurs, then I'm going to start writing a project next week or two, because I don't want to solve REALTORS, I want to help everybody. It's a shame that you're making all this money for the ones that are making money. It's worse if you're not making money, and you're doing this, what the hell are you doing? But the ones that are making a 300, 400 grand a year, I have lots of friends of mine, and you're doing that. And then they're running a team, or they're just, it's a little agent, and they're working 100 hours a week, you're missing your life, don't do it. Don't do it. It's a lot. Yeah. And you know, Mitch, you said something at the beginning, and I just want to reiterate this, and I apologize, it might seem a bit out of order, but it's so important, because I really, you know, I always like when our listeners like take action on some of the, obviously the things our guests say, and you said something very, very powerful, and I just want to make sure that people are here to, to hear it one more time, which is, Mitch's follow-up, a part of his follow-up, was sending two emails a month, one was a market update, and then two weeks later, here's what's going on in the area, fun, cool things for the family, for yourself, whatever. That's, that was his follow-up, and that means that those people got 26 emails a year, and the reason why Mitch said that is, you know, do people really want to read your market out? Look, maybe, maybe not, doesn't matter. What matters is that they're getting repeated information from you, that is, it could be useful to them, it's not annoying to them, and, you know, they're just getting that repetition, and Mitch said the whole thing is precipitated on, who's right in front of them when they decide they need to sell, to buy or sell, and that's exactly right, and it's hard not to be on somebody's mind if you're hitting them every two weeks. Yeah, and the thing is, so ultimately, I am, so one of the books I've always, I can't tell you what's in it, because it's not his follow-up, I was throwing a podcast, but it's called Rockstar Sales Guy, it's, I saw it for a buck on Amazon, Rockstar Sales Guy, don't do chicken soup marketing. So I, I can see the email marketing, chicken soup marketing person, sure, but I know they're not gonna pick up the phone. Yeah, honestly, I didn't pick up the phone that one. Right. Yeah, I'm not, I mean, I'm not, you know, I came up with these things for myself too, right? But the reality is, it's really that simple, and there's two things that people always ask you when I say I'm a REALTOR. I say, you know, I've said I'm a REALTOR, the first thing I have about this, oh, you're REALTOR, how's the market? Right. So that's why we came up with the market update, it's a big issue. And it changes every month and people are interested in that. And then like you said, the top 10 things that we do, everybody, let's go on. So unlike the newsletters, we all get emails from people that we subscribe to at one point, and we don't unsubscribe a block there because we like them. Yeah. So we get these people, we never meet them. I get you, I get 30 newsletters from REALTOR's, I haven't read them years. Sure. Because that's the same thing. People are giving stuff like, you have to give a little market update and then they'll give how to get the best garden seeds for your garden. Or how to, I mean, nobody cares. Yeah. Nobody cares. I mean, that's just real, right? Nobody cares. And I've asked you, Superzaggo, do you ever read your newsletters from REALTOR? Like, no. You know, and I can see the open rates of the, when I was doing newsletters, nobody looked at it. But we get about, from our phone list, we get about a 30 to 50% open rate. And that is, that is a good open rate. Absolutely good. I'm a marketer too. I can appreciate, I wish I was getting those open rates. Other great. Yeah, I mean, you typically want your mask market, we get about a 15 to 20%, which is pretty good. Open rate. But when we do that phone, because here's the thing about the phone contacts, you know them all. Yeah. And then the messaging, I'm going to give you a line and I'll say the slowings, I can't for a Boston guy. But this is the way we end those emails, because how you end is really important. And it's like this, as you know, as a REALTOR, I work by referral only, and I can really, really use your help. If you know someone looking to buy a cell phone, could you send me their contact info? Now two things happening. I use the word really, really, because it's very powerful, psychologically. Yep. And I asked for their contact info, not give them my contact info. Right. Because they're not going to give them my contact info. Right. I did a class recently with 100 agents. And I don't do this class at all, because I believe lead generation is 34 ways to generate leads. And so I said, I made everybody in the class take out their phone, and go through their phone, just eight minutes and say, I'm in a class right now where I'm in a contest, and I can really, really use your help, you know somebody looking to buy a cell phone. Same contract, right. We generated 185 leads at eight minutes. Unbelievable. And that's more than one, almost more than, well, it's more than one lead per person. Well, we know that only half the people actually did it too, right? Right. Of course. So it's probably, it's even more than that. I was in a bar with one of my agents recently having a check. Yeah. Uh, business is bad. This is only bad. Your brain is bad. This is always good. Sure. If you're slow, it's because of you. Right. And, uh, and so I said, take away your phone. And I made him do that. He texted 50 people. He got two responses, so two over two weeks. Uh, I'm shaking my head only because what a simple idea would a simple concept and look, the Brian Biffini built a whole coaching business on follow up and sending out Makler's once a month. And there's more to it, obviously, is a lot, a lot of good stuff there. But that's the, the crux of it is, you know, just continually, you know, pound away in a way that's not offensive to your, to your, uh, sphere. Yeah. And then the only other part I would recommend on that part is pick up the phone for the connectors. Yeah. Like everybody who connect is right on a connective. You're, you know, show your connector, right? Yeah. Uh, you know, so, but here's the one thing I want you about being a connector. I had people asking me for stuff all the time. I love as many people in the world that want to. I love doing it. However, I get very frustrated when it's all about, take, not give. Yeah. So never, ever end your conversation with, thanks for looking me out and your conversation. What can I do for you? Yes. Right. And, and most times people are going to go, oh, I'm, I'm good. Oh, but, but hey, thanks. Yeah. It's, it's kind of like what we say when somebody, you know, loses somebody and we say, hey, so if there's anything I can do to help you through this, this, this difficult time. And nine times out of 10, they just go, oh, thanks for saying that. No, I'm good. But if I need something, I'll reach out. They don't reach out. But they appreciate that you care enough to say, hey, I want to help you. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a huge, I tell everybody, I've slogan to many, many years, I don't sell you. I help you. Yeah. But I still want to tell about my coach. He goes this is to that. If you don't leave, that's great. Go keep working 100 hours a week and have a miserable life. And when you're 60 years old, you're going to look back at your life and go, shit, I missed my kid. I should have listened to that guy. I missed 20 years ago. But the reality is is if you sell from the heart and really care about people, this is an easy business. People know, people know if you're just a, you know, like what do they call it, commission breath, right? People know, I don't care about money. Even when I lost 82 million dollars and I got this business, I didn't do that. I said, I'm just going to help as many people as I can and be the best I can be at what I do. And I'm not going to get by the way. I'm just, I'm okay with it. I'm not the best. I mean, I can't read, you know, 80, I mean, you know, I'm okay with it. But I am a really good business guy. Yeah. And I always sell from the heart. I also have heart. I like the, there's a, I don't know if it's Jim Rome or I want to, I really would love to quote properly cite this person who's created it or said this. But, but I've heard this if you give other people what they want, you will give, you will get everything you want. Yeah. Zinc Ziggler. Zinc Ziggler. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Do help people get what they want and they'll get what you want. It's, and that's how I live my, I've lived my life. Every business of every own has been the exact same thing. Yeah. So how do I, how do I people with youth, they're close because then you're not selling anything. Right. Like I never ever, and I'll be a little bit sure to be in sales person. I am. I really, really get at it. You know why? Because I don't sell anything. Because people don't like to be sold. No, I was, I had, I do a Monday morning match to my here in my office. And we just had this one of my previous, and they want to do scripture. And they're going, I can't teach you scripts. I've not a script. I do bullet points and I talk to people like human being. And I'll say, well, if you do this today, will you do that? No, I saw who was that. Brian Tracy is one of those guys back in the 80s. Yeah. And I'm like, that is so not me. Is like using this clothes and that clothes. I'm like, yeah, why not just be human being? The worst, the one I, the one I dislike is the, would you like to meet tomorrow at two or Friday at three? You're like, okay, just ask them when they're free. Like it's not that big of a deal. Yeah, it's just Tom Hopkins, by the way. Yeah. But the reality is, you know, I'm on a mission. I have, um, you know, 63. I don't know how many more years I have left. In fact, my general manager is my assistant for 19 years. She's like, why are you doing all this? Why are you studying a coaching business at 63 years old? And I just don't feel like I've impacted or not people. In the mistake I made the last 20 years, I've been coaching against the 20 years. I was coaching mostly new agents and none of them did the work. And I'll give you an example. Last year I did 250 coaching goals, different agents, five did the work. Wow. And they were all newer and so on jet on December 31st. I gave up new agents. So if you're new agents up there, I'm the wrong coach for you. I will not coach you. Yeah. And that's what I realized that I've been coaching the wrong people. I want to teach successful people how do you unbelievably wicked awesome success. Yeah. Right. And that's like reading freedom and how they actually run it. How do you build your foundation? How do you hire the right people to leverage yourself? How do you contract agents that paid 50% right? And then I'm still hating you for it. How do you do all that? I'm really successful business where you're being a good dad. You know, I'm an agent locally 20 years old. And it's just proves my point. Yeah. 20 years old, a one year old and a four year old working 100 hours. Equipment style working on me. Now he has cancer and he's made out making. But his business is running really well right now, even though he's in the hospital. And he's gone. Wow. Because I talk a lot of other business. And so he's still going to sell 25 homes this year from being sick. Well, and you know, and again, I, it's a horrible thing and, and hopefully he, he makes a speedy recovery. And the fact that his business is running helps his stress level, which has to help his cancer treatments. I mean, this is, we're talking about physical health as well. We're not just talking about time. You know, physical health is a thing. And we need to, we need to take very good care of that. Yeah. The, the, the reason I get my brokerage was 56. And you know, you can't solve brokerage. That's kind of a funny way they said the terms. I'm not going to get that whole joke that I went through. But I was, my dad died at 50, but my mom got a 50. Almost all my relatives. Wow. In what else? 56. My stress levels to the roof. I broke into, you know, and because you're, you're chasing people to be successful as a broker. And the easiest people to bring on is a brokerage is due agents. So we spend our time doing that. Even though we know 86% are going to fail, we do that. And I broke into 500 agents to get 50 good ones. Oh, I, I could, I told, I could do that. I could give you even bigger numbers for me. Meaning we've had the same experience. Yeah. Well, it's what it is. And then it is the worst type of, you know this is, I asked because I took on all brand new agents ago. That was my thing. I'm not bringing on brand new agents. I'm going to change their lives, right? For me, 10 years to figure out, I'm never going to change in my life. I mean, I changed something like that. And, but what I realized is I bit in the sounds horrible. I don't mean to do. I didn't learn to base my business based on mediocrity. And that was a hard thing to do. The swallow tract on everybody wanted to hear. Yeah. But I will tell you that if I still had my brokerage today, I'd be dead. I really, I wouldn't be dead. It would have killed me. My dad died of heart disease stress. And my stress levels, he actually came to me. It's kind of weird, but he came to me and he sitting on a plane. He'd been dead for 20 years. And I knew he died from stress. And I was freaking out. I was working 100 hours a week trying to get people from here to here, just that medium, right? And so I put on some headphones, fight home first class from Denver. I have to help you. I wasn't stoned because it personally, guys, potten Denver. And I heard a voice. I was listening to music and a voice. Your expectations and up their expectations. Three times I heard that voice and I took my headphones off like shit. And I realized it was my dad talking to me, say, you're going to die. If you start living by expecting them to be like you, it was probably the biggest lesson I teach. I didn't know all my speaking gigs right now with this, I do a longer version of this. I do a limited time. But your expectations are the cause of almost all your disappointment. I couldn't that is such a powerful statement. Let's say it again, your expectations are the, are the cause of all of the challenges you're currently facing. Almost all your disappointments. And I'm talking about from family to customers to friends. I that day, that moment I took those headphones off. I rewrote my entire business model. And I said, you know what? I'm going to be happy wherever they're happy. But I didn't just do it there. I did it my entire life. I have no expectations of my life, no expectations of my kids. You know, I personally expectations I control me. Yeah. I can control that. But I can't control. I can't want you more than you want for you. Yeah. And and right. We think, you know, oftentimes our own drive and motivation can be transferred or can be taught. And you know, maybe if the stars lined up, maybe it could with one person, but you'd go through several hundred. You know, and I totally agree. There's this idea of not having expectations. You actually demonstrated this earlier in this conversation. I just want to highlight earlier, Mitch was talking about the very beginning. He was talking about your contact list. And he says, you know, we know that 11 out of every hundred contacts you have are going to need a REALTOR. And you know, in the next 12 months or whatever that stat is. Mitch goes, I use seven because I want to set the expectation low. And you even said that. I want to set the expectation low and then, then, you know, rise above it. Because if you can go, Hey, if I only get seven out of out of a hundred, I can, maybe I can have a really nice life. I don't have to shoot for, for, you know, this perfect 11, right? And I use everything. So I'll give you the other way. I use expectations, inspections. I have not lost to be into inspections in 14 years. It is like, it's also, so DJ, let me explain to you our inspection. They're going to find 40 or 50 things wrong with the house. And the seller's not going to fix any of them. So, you know, so then when they have an inspection contact, 15 or 20 things wrong, like, oh, not to bad. The seller, I say the same day, I say, look, they're going to find 40 or 50 things wrong. And the buyer's going to want most of the things. So when they come back and they only want four or five things fixed, it's awesome. Expectations, I love this. And what you're doing is you're, you're, you're really setting this, this, the table for here's what's going to happen. And then when it happens, there's fewer surprises. There's, oh, this is, we expected this. This is, oh, and we're going to overshoot in some ways, these expectations or under shoot, depending on what, you know, how it would benefit the relationship. And then we're going to proceed from there and people go, like, oh, thank you for telling me. The worst thing is when a REALTOR has a client that goes, what's next? What are we doing next? Right? The expectation hasn't been set. So, so for your, for your people, let's see, I want you to think about a couple of things. And this is really emotional part because when, but I tell you that I didn't see my kids grow up, it's, I can tell you I talk about it. It's my biggest only regret in my life. And I want you to go home with size of the mirror thing. I want you to go home and talk to your spouse, if you ever spouse. And I want you to ask them how to say love and business. And I guarantee you they hate the business. There's a great video out there. If you want to really watch a good video, if you go to YouTube and tap the Mitch Reback, Chinat, I always think Chinat is an interview for my wife, but what she saw, what she hated real estate. Because I was working 100 hours a week as a president. I've never had any conversation with her once. She's talking away because I want to talk. And 10 minutes of the conversation, it's like, you haven't heard of where to sit. Did you? I go, no, not a word. And I knew something had to change, but I did. But there's the other thing I want you to think about if you have kids, because again, there's no going back. My kids are all between 41 and 45 right now. There's no going back there. Probably the reason why I only work 35 hours a week now because I have four grandkids and that's my life. That's way more important than all my money. But kids don't love TIN and eat. Yeah. And I'm not talking about being there. I'm talking about being present when you're there. So now we didn't have supple back then. Right? In the 80s and 90s. But I have my brain. My brain was always thinking about something else. Now you go, I got on my grandson's baseball player. I got on the baseball game. I don't miss it. I'll fly home anywhere to be home for his baseball game. I miss I went to the small two year, but I don't miss that. But anyway, I will tell you that the majority of parents are sitting there on their phones. Right? I didn't think my phone would be to my car. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And I go to dinner with my wife. I don't take my phone to the restaurant. We my girlfriend and I have the same policy. But because it's so easy to want to do that. And there's always something to look at on your phone. There's always a notification. There's always an email, a text, whatever. And we say, you know, let's let's not be interrupted. And we do that when we watch television. That's another thing. Television movies. When we're talking and we're planning our week. Yeah. No cell phones. I agree. And the other part that is even your voice mail. Is wrong. I'm guessing. So you have to set the boundaries. Yeah. How many doctors can you call it 10 o'clock? And hey, my heart is a work. Right? Not too many. Right? Yeah. So you set the boundaries and one of my good friends is a big white Jesus and San Diego. Pete Milton. He's his, his, his wife. If you're calling you after six o'clock, I will call you back to the next business day. Right? I used to tell my customers because I didn't work Sundays. I almost died in 2004 and I stopped working Sundays at that point. I'm going to work as working Sundays, the, you know, 16 hour days. So I stopped working when that happened. I just got married three months earlier. And I'm like, you know what? I'm not working Sundays anymore. And I say, look, you have me from eight to eight Monday through Saturday on Sundays. My family day, if you can't be stuck that on the wrong bill to play. Yeah. Never lost the customer. And I said, I have lots of bills in there working that if you need to see a property. I'll show you now. Someone came to me with a million dollar property. Wanted to look at. I still showed them a property of something. But the reality is I would bet you after 2004 that was it. July to celebrate that you I work. By Sunday. Wow. Amazing. Well, the book is the big lie. And we're going to have a link to that on. You can find it on Amazon. You can find it really anywhere. Books are sold. We're going to have a direct link to that and all of Mitch's books. Also, if you want to have Mitch speak or you interested in his coaching, Mitch reback.com is where you go. That's our I B a K M I T C H R I B A K dot com. Mitch is dynamic. He's an amazing speaker. He's, you know, more than anything. He's proven to be successful, not just in real estate, but in many other industries by applying the exact same principles. So I know for me, it was funny. Mitch, as you were talking, what I do is I actually recruit REALTORS. I don't, I don't practice. I have a license, but I don't use it. But I recruit REALTORS and I'm realizing I was doing some of it wrong. I am going to apply your exact principles to some of the some of the recruiting techniques that I use or the really it's all follow up. So all the follow up techniques and you are absolutely right. And I am what I'm going to be waiting for is for that broker to say, you know, or that we call them brokers in old. I've had agent that agent to say, hey, you know, I'm a little disappointed with my firm or something went wrong and they screwed up or I don't like them anymore. And again, if they're getting that regular messaging for me and phone calls as well, and other things. I'm going to be the one that's most a politely aggressively in a polite way saying, I want you, I want you, I want you. And then whenever that opportunity comes up, hopefully they'll give it a tip on that. So I want to think, so that's my business to the. So one of the things that I do that works is I give them content. Yeah. So I have a Monday, every Monday tip of the week. Yep. It goes out to my Mr. David's and not with me. And I don't push you know, coaching let me know because my coaching, I don't charge my agents anything. You know, for coaching, obviously. And so I give you two chances to work. We can join me at the XP or you can thank my coach and I'll give you a chance. And I'm not a, I'm not a digressier. I'm sure you would better recruit. I'm even with my brokerage. I was never a recruiter. Like I literally never, I never picked up the phone once. Even with the XP, I think I called two people. And actually I have 22 other people now. By the way, I call two people, I'm just that's not who I am. You know, you live within who you are and I'm a contribution guy. Let me help you get whatever you want. Maybe you'll join me. Maybe you won't. And if you do great, you don't, that's okay to have a good laugh. I love it. Mitch, thank you. On behalf of the audience, you gave so many, not just great actual tactical strategies, but also ways to think about your life, your business and, you know, taking a hard look in the mirror and saying, okay, what's not going well in my life right now? And everyone's got something that's not going well in their life at all times. The trick is to know what it is. So if you know what it is, you can work on it, but you can't work on it if you don't have time. And time is really what Mitch is aiming to give you back. You want more time with your family, your friends, yourself, you know, volunteer opportunities. Whatever you want to do in life, you need time to do that. And this is a job that that can, if you treat it like a job, it could eat up your time. If you treat it like your own business and you really run it like an entrepreneur, then hopefully it will give you back more of that time. And you can continue to make a good living. So just one last thing I can talk about it. I want your mindset to be invested $250,000 in a style in real estate business, not $1,500. Nobody cares about $1,500. Right. But if you invested $250,000, what would you do differently? I guarantee the word is everything. Yeah. It's a great point. It's a great point. So start now. This is a great time with the NAR settlement. Sort of sort of pushing a lot of agents out because they're ones. E2's the agents, they're leaving. They, I will tell you, we have a holding company here for people that don't practice. It's for the whole state of Illinois. We're the largest one in the state. We have 1100 agents in there and we added 300 of them since the NAR settlement. That is how quickly people are exiting. So what a great thing for everyone listening because you can pick up their clients. Prospect, prospect, prospect, follow, follow, follow, Mitch is the guy to learn how to do all of those things and run a successful business along the way and maybe figure out how to compensate people like Mitch was doing, where you're paying them a flat fee for various tasks. You're focusing on the things you like and that are business building for you. And you know, Mitch is going to show you exactly how to do that. Check out the book, The Big Live. Link to that in the show notes. Mitch, on behalf of everyone, thank you again, really loved having you on. On behalf of Mitch and myself, we want to thank the audience. We really appreciate you.
