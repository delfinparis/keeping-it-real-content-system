[00:01:16] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:20] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:23] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:25] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:28] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:31] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:33] Well, what if I were to tell you
[00:01:34] there's a recruiting and retention tool
[00:01:36] powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:38] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:41] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:44] and which agents at your own firm
[00:01:46] are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:48] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:51] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:53] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:56] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:58] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:02:01] for each agent in your market
[00:02:03] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:06] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:08] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:11] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:13] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:14] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:17] based on that agent's needs
[00:02:19] and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:20] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:23] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:24] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:27] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:30] corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:32] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:35] That's corded.io and now onto the show.
[00:02:53] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real,
[00:02:56] the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents.
[00:03:00] My name's DJ Paris.
[00:03:01] I'm your guide and host through the show
[00:03:02] and we've been going strong for seven years
[00:03:05] and that's all because of you.
[00:03:06] Thank you so much.
[00:03:07] I think we're over 700 episodes or close to it.
[00:03:10] So that's because of you all who are listening.
[00:03:13] So if you're new, welcome.
[00:03:14] If you're not new and been listening for years,
[00:03:17] welcome back.
[00:03:18] As always, please tell a friend.
[00:03:20] That's the best way that you can help me continue
[00:03:23] to get the show out to more people who can do more episodes.
[00:03:26] And just a moment, we're going to be speaking with top queens,
[00:03:30] producer, Ethan David off and also he's a team leader
[00:03:33] and he's going to talk about how it is to grow a team.
[00:03:36] You're going to learn so much from him.
[00:03:37] Just wait, it's an awesome conversation.
[00:03:40] And I want to tell you about switching gears for just a moment,
[00:03:44] a tool that I built for you and I need your feedback
[00:03:46] and it's super, super cool.
[00:03:49] And I'm going to have a link to it.
[00:03:50] I'm going to eventually have a way
[00:03:52] where you could just text a code and I'll send it to you.
[00:03:54] But for now, if you can go to joincal.com,
[00:03:57] which is kale like kale realty, so joincal.com
[00:04:00] and then go forward slash AI hyphen prompts
[00:04:04] with the asset, the AI prompts.
[00:04:07] I built a tool that will take any part of your business
[00:04:09] that you were looking to improve
[00:04:11] and it will actually super charge an AI prompt query for you.
[00:04:15] So you'll ask you some questions about what you want
[00:04:17] to do for your business and it will write the perfect AI query
[00:04:21] that you can copy and paste right into chat GPT
[00:04:24] because if you've ever just used chat GPT
[00:04:26] and not gotten good results, you know,
[00:04:28] maybe throw in a listing description
[00:04:29] and it ends up sounding like every other listing description
[00:04:31] or maybe you're like, I need some social media ideas
[00:04:33] or how should I prospect or how should I negotiate better
[00:04:36] and it just aren't getting the results you want.
[00:04:38] This is the tool for you, totally free.
[00:04:40] There's no registration.
[00:04:42] I just need you to tell me how it's working for you
[00:04:44] and if it's helpful.
[00:04:45] So check it out joincal.com, forward slash AI hyphen prompts
[00:04:48] and let me know what you think of it
[00:04:51] and I'm continually adding more features
[00:04:52] and it's really cool and I'm really excited
[00:04:55] to share that with you guys.
[00:04:57] We actually built it for our agents here at our firm
[00:04:59] and we thought, hey, why are we keeping it just for ourselves
[00:05:02] everyone should try it.
[00:05:03] So it's there and eventually I'll have a different way
[00:05:05] for you to access it but that's where it is for now.
[00:05:07] All right guys, let's get onto it.
[00:05:08] My conversation with Ethan Davidoff.
[00:05:24] asanjane.com
[00:05:25] Best piece of advice you've heard in real estate?
[00:05:29] Best piece of advice I've heard in real estate is,
[00:05:33] don't grow too fast.
[00:05:35] You don't want to bite off more than you can chew
[00:05:38] and you gotta let things happen organically,
[00:05:42] but obviously you wanna push the envelope,
[00:05:44] just don't grow too fast, yeah.
[00:05:47] Yeah, worst piece of advice you've received.
[00:05:50] Don't get your license, it's not worth it.
[00:05:54] You don't need it, you could still transact deals
[00:05:57] without it.
[00:05:59] You'll be fine.
[00:06:01] If I listened, I mean, I basically screwed right now.
[00:06:05] I mean, I wouldn't be where I'm at, so.
[00:06:07] And one more additional question,
[00:06:09] is AI coming for the REALTORS?
[00:06:13] This is hard to really, okay.
[00:06:17] For the lower end market.
[00:06:18] Yeah, I'm with you.
[00:06:21] I think the ones Z2Z agent is gonna struggle.
[00:06:24] And the top agents are gonna thrive.
[00:06:27] I think they're gonna kill it, yeah.
[00:06:30] There is no free lunch.
[00:06:32] And honestly, with everything,
[00:06:36] I've been doing this, we'll get into it, I guess,
[00:06:39] when you ask me more questions,
[00:06:40] but I haven't been doing this for decades,
[00:06:42] but I've seen a real shift of old brokers,
[00:06:47] versus new brokers, and there's no free lunch.
[00:06:51] No.
[00:06:52] Ethan Davidoff is our guest today,
[00:06:55] and this is a really fun one for me.
[00:06:57] I am super excited to talk more with Ethan.
[00:07:01] He's born and raised in New York City.
[00:07:02] He's a Queens guy, and he's a Queens native,
[00:07:04] leading one of the city's most active
[00:07:07] and tight knit real estate teams.
[00:07:08] He's a Compass guy.
[00:07:10] He is over 100 transactions a year,
[00:07:12] which is amazing, across residential and investment sales.
[00:07:16] Ethan is known for his transparency, market expertise,
[00:07:18] and high touch client service.
[00:07:21] He's a graduate of Baruch College,
[00:07:23] Zicklin School of Business,
[00:07:24] and he combines sharp analytics with genuine care
[00:07:27] to deliver results that exceed expectation.
[00:07:31] Ruded in his family's immigrant background,
[00:07:33] he brings cultural understanding and versatility
[00:07:35] to every deal outside of work.
[00:07:38] Ethan enjoys traveling, music, and spending time
[00:07:41] with his wife and son.
[00:07:44] And we just learned that Ethan lives a five minute walk
[00:07:48] from my brother-in-law in Forest Hills,
[00:07:50] the soot, beforehand.
[00:07:52] Ethan, welcome.
[00:07:52] Oh, by the way, before you say hi,
[00:07:55] follow Ethan on Instagram.
[00:07:57] Ethan is E-I-T-H-A-N-D-A-V.
[00:08:00] We'll have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:08:02] E-I-T-H-A-N-D-A-V on Instagram.
[00:08:06] Ethan, welcome to the show.
[00:08:07] Thanks for having me, DJ.
[00:08:10] I'm so excited to talk to you.
[00:08:12] You remind me a lot of my brother-in-law,
[00:08:15] which I quite adore, who's like the greatest guy ever.
[00:08:18] He's also a real estate broker.
[00:08:19] He's on the commercial side, but he is a great guy.
[00:08:23] And so it's kind of like I'm talking to my brother-in-law.
[00:08:25] So I appreciate you and I appreciate reaching out to us
[00:08:30] and I'm super excited to talk to you.
[00:08:33] So let's start at the beginning.
[00:08:34] So how did you get into real estate?
[00:08:38] So I'm a COVID agent.
[00:08:41] I'm part of the trend that got their license during COVID.
[00:08:47] And, but I was kind of at the end of the low rate environment,
[00:08:53] so to speak.
[00:08:53] So I didn't intend on being an agent.
[00:08:59] I got out of school with a finance degree,
[00:09:02] business administration with the Baruch.
[00:09:05] And I had a lot of fun through college.
[00:09:08] I didn't get my internships in play.
[00:09:11] And I just, I started an internship after college
[00:09:16] with a small development startup.
[00:09:21] They were awesome.
[00:09:22] They gave me so much first hand experience
[00:09:26] on what it takes to redevelop these walk-up buildings
[00:09:31] and give that middle market, that new market,
[00:09:35] a nice finished product, but also that old New York charm
[00:09:39] in a really convenient neighborhood at an affordable price.
[00:09:44] So it was a great, great experience.
[00:09:47] I came into there wanting to be an underwriter, right?
[00:09:51] They looked at me, had a few conversations with me.
[00:09:53] They're like, no, you're gonna be calls.
[00:09:56] I'm like, but I have a degree.
[00:09:59] I did my, I'm a finance guy.
[00:10:02] Like, no, your sales guy, dude.
[00:10:05] And I ended up sourcing a couple of market deals for them.
[00:10:10] Within three months, I had my first deal under contract
[00:10:12] with them just without even being an agent.
[00:10:16] And it was a wonderful experience.
[00:10:19] From there, I just, I realized I'm more people facing,
[00:10:24] I wanna be with the residents.
[00:10:27] I wanna be with people.
[00:10:29] I loved working with investors.
[00:10:31] I still do.
[00:10:32] I still work with a good handful of investors.
[00:10:35] But as I was shadowing the residential rental side
[00:10:39] of their business, I said, this seems more
[00:10:44] of something I would like to do.
[00:10:46] And I got my license in the next couple months.
[00:10:50] And I started with the rental firm and the rest is history.
[00:10:54] So you've been practicing for what, less than five years?
[00:10:58] I'm in my fifth, yeah.
[00:10:59] And you're doing a hundred deals a year.
[00:11:01] That's incredible.
[00:11:02] That is truly, truly incredible.
[00:11:06] I've, I've talked to, well, we have almost a thousand agents
[00:11:10] here at our own firm here in Chicago.
[00:11:12] And I've never seen anybody do that here.
[00:11:14] And I've also rarely seen that done
[00:11:17] at all the top producers I've talked to on this podcast.
[00:11:21] It's been done, but not very commonly.
[00:11:24] So hats off to you.
[00:11:26] So our audience here is really interested in learning
[00:11:30] what you're doing and how you're doing it.
[00:11:31] And maybe some advice you might have.
[00:11:34] So let's, and you said your parents were immigrants.
[00:11:38] Where did your parents come from?
[00:11:40] They're from Uzbekistan.
[00:11:42] And my father was, he was born in Uzbekistan
[00:11:45] and then he migrated to Israel.
[00:11:47] And you know, we had, it was, it was, it was a great childhood
[00:11:51] with I guess the melting pot of all of that.
[00:11:55] Yeah.
[00:11:57] Yeah.
[00:11:58] Do you have a favorite bagel place, by the way,
[00:12:00] in in, in forestels or where you are?
[00:12:03] Or regal?
[00:12:03] OK.
[00:12:04] So I have, I have a few.
[00:12:06] OK.
[00:12:06] And so number one is utopia bagels.
[00:12:09] OK.
[00:12:11] That's in Queens.
[00:12:12] And it's not forest hills, but it's, it's, it's got my heart.
[00:12:16] It's where I go before I take off, before I leave the city.
[00:12:19] It's either utopia bagels or I go to my favorite pizza shop.
[00:12:23] And which awesome street pizza is pretty, pretty fire, actually.
[00:12:27] And then the other one is actually one that I just saw.
[00:12:32] And there's something that stuck with me
[00:12:34] about this bagel shop was, the bagel was super clean.
[00:12:38] Like it was, it was perfect.
[00:12:40] And the branding, like I just can't forget it.
[00:12:43] It was my first time there.
[00:12:45] And I, my cousin has actually, he's like,
[00:12:48] oh, you've never been there before, not, it's great.
[00:12:51] But it's expensive.
[00:12:52] I'm like, no, the branding is perfect.
[00:12:53] I'll always go back.
[00:12:54] Leon's bagels.
[00:12:55] Leon's, OK, well, shout out.
[00:12:58] I, we do not have good bagels here in Chicago.
[00:13:00] And I, I long for that.
[00:13:03] I do get to go.
[00:13:03] My brother-in-law's get to stay at his childhood condo from time
[00:13:08] to time in Forrest Hills.
[00:13:10] So I will, I will search out those places and try that.
[00:13:14] Because there, there was a good bagel place,
[00:13:16] and it's no longer there.
[00:13:18] No, I know what you're talking about on the Boulevard.
[00:13:20] Yes.
[00:13:20] Yes.
[00:13:21] I forgot the name.
[00:13:22] I don't remember.
[00:13:23] It was pretty good.
[00:13:24] It was really good.
[00:13:25] Yeah.
[00:13:26] And it's right by the express bus into the city.
[00:13:28] So you're in Midtown in like 30 minutes, you know.
[00:13:31] So.
[00:13:32] So anyway, so you started a real estate investment trust.
[00:13:35] You decided to go into brokerage.
[00:13:37] You started in rentals, which of course
[00:13:39] is very common for real estate agents in New York.
[00:13:43] And that game has really flipped, right?
[00:13:46] In the last, I don't know, a couple of years.
[00:13:48] I guess the Fair Act, which most of our listeners
[00:13:51] won't be aware of unless you are an agent in New York.
[00:13:54] But basically, for my understanding and correct me,
[00:13:57] if I'm wrong, and I might be,
[00:14:00] is that, and there's a few cities that operated this way.
[00:14:04] Boston, I think, is kind of this way as well,
[00:14:06] is that in some places, the tenant actually pays the commission,
[00:14:11] which is a big ask for a tenant,
[00:14:13] especially the most expensive place to live in the country,
[00:14:16] being either San Francisco or New York.
[00:14:19] But I don't even think in San Francisco,
[00:14:20] they pay the commission, but certainly in New York,
[00:14:22] that was the case in a lot of times.
[00:14:25] And so, brokerage really, a REALTOR's really had
[00:14:29] an uphill battle.
[00:14:29] This was a big ask.
[00:14:31] You might be, somebody might be spending $7,000 a month,
[00:14:34] and then, oh, there's another $7,000.
[00:14:36] And then there's last month's rent and all of that.
[00:14:39] So it's certainly tricky.
[00:14:41] And then legislation changed to say,
[00:14:43] hey, we're gonna basically change that now landlord pays.
[00:14:47] So, let me know, am I right about that,
[00:14:49] or is it changed a bit?
[00:14:51] Has not changed.
[00:14:53] And I mean, it is what you make of it as a broker.
[00:14:58] At the end of the day, you're in a service industry,
[00:15:01] and that should come first, no matter what.
[00:15:06] I think that to get, I mean, if you want my opinion,
[00:15:11] I don't know if you're asking me yet, but I just feel like
[00:15:16] there shouldn't have been involvement on the fair market.
[00:15:21] So to label it the fair act, I feel isn't exactly fair.
[00:15:26] But at the same time, it is incentivizing tenants
[00:15:32] to have more liquidity.
[00:15:35] And clients that have more liquidity and not be forced
[00:15:39] to throw tens of thousands away on broker fees, I get it.
[00:15:44] But at the end of the day, it's all supply and demand, right?
[00:15:47] And especially in the markets that I'm focused in,
[00:15:49] and that we really, we're really, really deep in,
[00:15:53] like West Village, Soho, these areas,
[00:15:58] they're broker-free areas for a reason.
[00:16:00] The demand is high.
[00:16:01] How do you, you know, like, but, you know,
[00:16:05] the tenant ended up paying for it at the end of the day.
[00:16:07] It didn't change anything.
[00:16:09] Right, the tenant's still paying it just in a different way.
[00:16:12] Yeah, and the landlord's making more,
[00:16:14] because what am I gonna do?
[00:16:15] Am I gonna, am I gonna like charge my landlord,
[00:16:19] you know, a high-roker fee?
[00:16:20] No.
[00:16:21] I'm gonna charge them a reasonable fee based
[00:16:23] on the amount of business that we do together.
[00:16:26] It's business, right?
[00:16:28] And would I charge a tenant a high fee if I,
[00:16:30] it's a service industry, like if a high fee
[00:16:33] will cause someone to be completely distraught
[00:16:38] while they're extremely qualified,
[00:16:40] they appear to be a great tenant, you know,
[00:16:42] like just everything adds up on paper.
[00:16:44] Would I want to, you know, stick a high fee to them?
[00:16:48] No, that's just not how I do business, you know?
[00:16:51] Yeah.
[00:16:53] So it's one of those things that sort of,
[00:16:55] it sounds cool for the tenant
[00:16:57] and then at the end of the day, they're paying it anyway.
[00:16:59] It's kind of...
[00:17:00] Do you want the numbers on my end?
[00:17:02] I'm curious, yeah, I'd love to know.
[00:17:04] So we did a numbers year over year.
[00:17:05] We managed a very large portfolio of my team
[00:17:07] and we brought up on average over 17%.
[00:17:15] Wow.
[00:17:17] Yeah.
[00:17:18] Hell's kitchen, leading.
[00:17:21] Soho and Wes Village, like, but really,
[00:17:25] like these markets, especially the No-Fee markets,
[00:17:29] where we were No-Fee, regardless, right?
[00:17:34] Shot.
[00:17:34] Like it's weird, but yeah, it obviously has a little bit
[00:17:40] to do with rent increases year over year,
[00:17:42] but mostly to do with baking in the broker fee now.
[00:17:45] And the entire market has been shaken by it.
[00:17:48] Yeah.
[00:17:50] Yeah, it's one way or another you're paying for it.
[00:17:53] Yeah, it's baked in, right?
[00:17:54] Yeah, it's probably sounds cool politically,
[00:17:58] but maybe at the end of the day,
[00:17:59] people have to get paid.
[00:18:02] So let's talk about building your business.
[00:18:05] So you're native, you're from there.
[00:18:09] And what...
[00:18:10] You know, when you think about earning some,
[00:18:13] earning business and, you know, obviously,
[00:18:16] there's tens of thousands of REALTORS.
[00:18:18] Here in Chicago, we have 46,000.
[00:18:21] I'm sure New York has even more
[00:18:23] with all the burrows of course.
[00:18:25] I am curious, like, what...
[00:18:29] How do you go about sourcing business?
[00:18:34] Well, I'm a young guy.
[00:18:36] And my team, we're, you know, around the same age,
[00:18:40] some a little older, some a little younger.
[00:18:42] I've managed a small team and mostly new agents.
[00:18:46] I have one senior agent and, you know,
[00:18:50] the rest are like two-year, one-year agents.
[00:18:55] We are very big on prospecting, just cold prospecting.
[00:19:00] We don't wait for business to come our way,
[00:19:02] because I would not be able to sustain myself with that.
[00:19:07] The phone doesn't just ring magically?
[00:19:09] No, unfortunately it doesn't.
[00:19:11] And, you know, I had to learn that the hard way,
[00:19:13] but it was, you know, the majority of my business
[00:19:16] and my team's business is sourced from cold prospecting
[00:19:21] and we run with the fact that we know this city.
[00:19:25] Yeah.
[00:19:25] You know, like, I've never met you, you know,
[00:19:28] but I know exactly where your brother-in-law lives
[00:19:31] and everything.
[00:19:32] I think we know each other, but that...
[00:19:34] You can only really get that from a native, in my opinion.
[00:19:39] So that's the differentiating factor.
[00:19:41] And above all, you're gonna get a truly white glove service.
[00:19:47] You know, the phone is always answered
[00:19:49] when, you know, when we've established the relationship.
[00:19:54] But it's about, you get the business,
[00:19:56] you follow up, follow up, follow up, follow up, you know,
[00:19:59] and then, you know, you continue to roll that snowball.
[00:20:03] Yeah.
[00:20:03] The fortune is in the follow up and as much as I wish it wasn't
[00:20:09] and I wish the fortune was in the first part.
[00:20:11] That's the hardest part.
[00:20:13] Yeah, it's the hardest part and it's all...
[00:20:15] But in a weird way, it's also best that it's better
[00:20:19] than it's done that way because most people don't do the follow up.
[00:20:24] So it's like in a weird way, it's like that expression.
[00:20:26] It's not crowded along the extra mile.
[00:20:28] Like, it just isn't.
[00:20:30] Yes, of course, there's competition.
[00:20:31] There always is and good agents are going to always,
[00:20:33] you know, be at your heels.
[00:20:36] But most agents aren't.
[00:20:37] Most agents aren't going to be at your heels.
[00:20:39] And so, you know, you guys are aggressive in a good way
[00:20:42] and I mean that with no pejorative sense,
[00:20:45] obviously a very, very positive sense.
[00:20:49] So when you say cold prospecting, tell us like,
[00:20:51] what does that look like?
[00:20:52] What does that look like for your team?
[00:20:54] Well, it looks like postcarding, emailing about, you know,
[00:20:59] neighborhood updates and, you know,
[00:21:03] we do the phone calls and stuff with clients
[00:21:06] that we've engaged with.
[00:21:09] I don't want to say cold calling or anything like that.
[00:21:13] I don't know like how that works or, you know,
[00:21:17] but we do a lot of cold prospecting.
[00:21:21] Yeah.
[00:21:21] And, you know, so, you know, the phone calls,
[00:21:24] the text, the emails, no spam.
[00:21:26] I teach everyone, we go through a full course on my team.
[00:21:29] So in order to be a part of the program,
[00:21:32] you have to go through the course of learning how to prospect
[00:21:35] without just like, like, you have to add value, you know?
[00:21:41] It's, so, and it's been paying off very well.
[00:21:46] I'm very happy about it.
[00:21:48] It's just, it's the hardest thing to do.
[00:21:51] It's like getting to the gym, right?
[00:21:53] Yes.
[00:21:53] You really don't want to do it, but face it, like, you have to.
[00:21:58] You have to do it or you're going to get fat and ugly.
[00:22:00] I know.
[00:22:01] I, every Monday, I have a trainer.
[00:22:04] And so for 42 years, I struggled to get to the gym
[00:22:08] and I rarely did.
[00:22:10] And I was always, you know, relatively fit or not overweight,
[00:22:14] but I wasn't strong and I wasn't really in shape.
[00:22:18] I just didn't look overweight.
[00:22:20] And finally, I was like 42 and I'm like, I have to get in shape.
[00:22:25] So I said, I'm going to have to get a trainer
[00:22:27] and every, I do it three times a week.
[00:22:30] And on Mondays, I do it at eight o'clock in the morning,
[00:22:32] which is brutal because I don't, like you said,
[00:22:36] I don't want to do it.
[00:22:37] There's no part of me.
[00:22:38] I want to sit on the couch and do nothing all day
[00:22:41] and not even work.
[00:22:42] I don't even want to work.
[00:22:43] Like, I just want, that's my, unfortunately,
[00:22:46] that is what my brain wants me to do.
[00:22:48] But I know that's not good for me.
[00:22:50] So I force myself to do it and, and then I get all the benefits.
[00:22:55] But all you have to do is force yourself to do it,
[00:22:58] which is not easy.
[00:22:59] I'm not saying it's easy, but you're right.
[00:23:01] It's, it's the, it's all the heavy lifting pardon the pun,
[00:23:05] but it's the heavy lifting of, of prospecting,
[00:23:08] lead gen following up.
[00:23:11] It's all the things that most people don't want to do.
[00:23:15] Yeah, and, and the other part is that
[00:23:20] you should never be afraid, right?
[00:23:23] Because like, there are so many reasons
[00:23:27] to be fearful of prospecting with someone who you've never met,
[00:23:32] you know, obviously like, it could be dangerous,
[00:23:34] but like downright dangerous, right?
[00:23:37] But you're targeting your lead, you're targeting the deal,
[00:23:41] you're adding value.
[00:23:42] The worst that happens is they say no,
[00:23:44] and you move the F on, right?
[00:23:48] And even then, like, can you continue
[00:23:51] to send market updates, and you were going to update?
[00:23:53] Is, is there, can I add value?
[00:23:56] That's literally the way that I've been able to get businesses.
[00:24:00] Not what can I make from you?
[00:24:02] Right.
[00:24:03] Can I sell your place?
[00:24:04] No, no, can I add value?
[00:24:06] I don't give a crap if you want to sell today.
[00:24:09] I don't care if you want to sell tomorrow.
[00:24:11] I don't care if you want to rent.
[00:24:12] I just want to know, like, can I help you in any way?
[00:24:16] Yeah.
[00:24:16] And when you are ready, if you are ready,
[00:24:19] I would love to be the one you use.
[00:24:22] Yeah, it's the old fashioned way of sales, earning it.
[00:24:25] You earning it.
[00:24:26] Yeah, earned it by give, give, give, give,
[00:24:29] and then hope that one day they go, you're the guy.
[00:24:33] And they will, because people always want
[00:24:37] a competent service professional
[00:24:39] who's just a good decent human being who gives, right?
[00:24:43] Like, I want my accountant to call me and go,
[00:24:45] I have this idea for you to save on to Axis, right?
[00:24:48] I want my, you know, I want people to reach out to me
[00:24:51] proactively and say, I've got a solution, you know,
[00:24:55] and when you find those people, whether it's a mechanic,
[00:24:58] whether it's a doctor, whoever,
[00:25:00] you latch onto those people,
[00:25:02] because you're like, wow, that person's good.
[00:25:04] And I love that, you know,
[00:25:06] it's taken me a long time to develop those people
[00:25:08] and I'm always readjusting the list.
[00:25:10] But boy, REALTORS no different.
[00:25:12] And I think, you know, I just currently I'm selling my condo
[00:25:16] and buying another place and upgrading
[00:25:20] because I'm engaged in going through that process.
[00:25:25] And anyway, congrats.
[00:25:26] Oh, thank you.
[00:25:27] Thank you.
[00:25:27] It's very exciting.
[00:25:28] We actually just went and saw the colors change,
[00:25:30] not too far from you.
[00:25:31] We went to main New Hampshire Vermont,
[00:25:33] just to go, you know, do that thing and that.
[00:25:36] That's really fun.
[00:25:37] But if anyone hasn't ever gone to see the colors change,
[00:25:40] most people probably haven't.
[00:25:41] Please go do that.
[00:25:42] It is so incredible.
[00:25:43] You won't believe it.
[00:25:43] But anyway, when I was going through this process
[00:25:47] and I am going through this process right now,
[00:25:49] and I am, I have a lot of friends,
[00:25:52] thankfully, in this industry who were very helpful to me,
[00:25:55] who were like, oh, you just have to do this, do this,
[00:25:58] do this, do this.
[00:25:59] And I was able to leverage those relationships
[00:26:01] to get things done in a way that was so helpful.
[00:26:07] I now have so much more respect,
[00:26:10] even though I'm in this industry for really good agents.
[00:26:14] And really good agents who provide value
[00:26:16] are just, like they don't get paid enough, I think,
[00:26:20] in some ways.
[00:26:21] Like even the agent on the other side of the transaction
[00:26:23] for the place I'm buying, he was so helpful to me,
[00:26:26] I could not believe it.
[00:26:28] I'm like, oh, that's right.
[00:26:28] It's called a cooperative commission.
[00:26:30] He was, he was, and he's a friend of mine.
[00:26:32] I mean, not a close, close friend,
[00:26:33] but he was like, oh, DG, you just have to do this.
[00:26:36] And I said, oh, thank you.
[00:26:37] Like it was very honest.
[00:26:38] It was very open.
[00:26:40] And I am so honored to sort of be,
[00:26:43] and I realized, like, oh, I couldn't do this.
[00:26:45] Like this isn't my skill set.
[00:26:47] And I'm not a practicing agent, so it shouldn't be.
[00:26:49] But I have so much respect for people who do.
[00:26:53] And that's you and your team.
[00:26:55] And you guys have just really, you talk about adding value.
[00:26:59] You guys have added so much value that you,
[00:27:01] you just take an a ton of business
[00:27:04] over the last several years when it's been pretty tricky
[00:27:08] to do that.
[00:27:09] And so I'm curious, you know, what,
[00:27:12] when you think about your clients
[00:27:14] and you're talking about adding value,
[00:27:17] you know, how do you think about staying in touch?
[00:27:20] Like obviously you say, you know,
[00:27:22] hey, maybe they're not ready today.
[00:27:23] But what are you doing to stay in touch
[00:27:25] so that they don't forget about you?
[00:27:29] Well, every situation is different, right?
[00:27:32] Obviously you get like the handwritten notes.
[00:27:34] You get the phone calls, the text.
[00:27:38] But it's the holiday messages for me.
[00:27:42] They get the texts from me, the personal texts.
[00:27:46] If I reached out to you, if we've spoken,
[00:27:48] if you know, for any reason we've ever connected,
[00:27:51] if now's not the right time, whatever it is,
[00:27:53] I always just, you know,
[00:27:54] I continue to wish you happy holidays.
[00:27:55] Every single holiday like major holiday, you know,
[00:27:58] we start with Thanksgiving, we go through Christmas,
[00:28:00] we go through New Year's,
[00:28:01] we go through the Jewish holidays,
[00:28:03] you know, everything.
[00:28:04] And I, I mean, like my wife kind of hates me for it
[00:28:09] because like every holiday like, you know,
[00:28:11] like we're off with, you know, with my kid now
[00:28:14] and you know, we're going to our families and stuff.
[00:28:16] But I'm like, babe, I need to be unbothered for like two hours
[00:28:20] and like you'll just see a bunch of blues,
[00:28:22] just texts everywhere.
[00:28:24] And that's me personally sending you a message
[00:28:26] and like truly wanting to catch up.
[00:28:30] And yeah, I mean, I manage everything through a CRM.
[00:28:34] Compass has a really good, really,
[00:28:37] like probably one of the best CRMs that I've ever used.
[00:28:41] And I'm able to manage just everything there.
[00:28:44] I treat that like basically my, my, my Bible.
[00:28:49] Yeah.
[00:28:49] You know, it's like every day you go through that.
[00:28:52] And you know, for your immediate, for your warmth,
[00:28:55] you have to have a warm list,
[00:28:57] obviously of the warm prospects.
[00:28:59] You got to stay on top of those.
[00:29:00] Those are more frequent.
[00:29:02] And then you have, you know, something that's a little colder,
[00:29:05] a little less warm, like kind of lukewarm.
[00:29:07] And you want to do those holiday,
[00:29:10] those monthly touch ups and all of that.
[00:29:12] But all in all, get to know your client,
[00:29:16] get to know your prospect.
[00:29:17] That's by number one thing, you know,
[00:29:19] besides the sale is, I want to get to know you,
[00:29:23] I want to know who you are, what, you know,
[00:29:25] get to going and, and just how, how could,
[00:29:30] how could I add value bottom line?
[00:29:32] How could I make your day?
[00:29:34] Yeah, I think, I think you're right.
[00:29:37] And there's lots of ways to do that.
[00:29:39] To developing kind of like a level of intimacy,
[00:29:41] where I'm going to be a value to you,
[00:29:44] but I also care about you.
[00:29:45] And I'm going to, you know, maybe you end up becoming friends
[00:29:49] with some of these people, of course.
[00:29:51] And it is a really fun way to get to know somebody, I think.
[00:29:57] And, and you certainly seem to have that energy.
[00:30:00] I bet you have a lot of clients that are friends now.
[00:30:03] And must be, must be a lot of fun to do that.
[00:30:07] Now, I'm curious, what is a typical day?
[00:30:09] And again, I know REALTOR days are different every day.
[00:30:13] But what is a typical day?
[00:30:14] If you were to structure your day
[00:30:16] and you had to control over it and nothing came at you
[00:30:19] to change it, you know, with family or whatever
[00:30:21] or your business, what would your typical day look like?
[00:30:25] Well, it's incredibly hard to, you know,
[00:30:28] to have full control.
[00:30:30] But as a team leader, that's the ultimate goal.
[00:30:31] That's why you hire agents to, you know,
[00:30:35] manage your business, your inflow.
[00:30:38] So, I mean, I try, I really try to stick through this,
[00:30:43] I guess, Rajaman is like, you know, you wake up.
[00:30:45] You, I try to wake up around the 7 a.m. mark, you know,
[00:30:50] get my, get my electrolytes in, get my caffeine running.
[00:30:54] If I'm not dropping off the kid in the morning to,
[00:30:57] to his daycare, I'm going straight to the gym.
[00:31:01] I gotta get the blood flowing, get the blood flowing,
[00:31:03] get into my office by, you know, the 9 a.m. range.
[00:31:06] But my phone is not off.
[00:31:08] And from the moment I wake up, I have to take the phone calls.
[00:31:13] I have to keep moving.
[00:31:15] As soon as I get into my office, you know,
[00:31:18] it's go through my to-do list.
[00:31:20] You know, you print, I print these, I keep these with me.
[00:31:23] These, you know, I got a few to-do list.
[00:31:25] This, now I need a personal one and I have the business one.
[00:31:29] And you have your, your warm leads.
[00:31:31] Like, that's just, that's what I have to have in front of me
[00:31:34] because the emails will bombard you
[00:31:36] all these little distractions.
[00:31:38] So I keep, I just make sure my to-do list is going through.
[00:31:42] I have a server with all the deal flow,
[00:31:47] with all my agents on it, and I make sure all of those messages
[00:31:50] are answered.
[00:31:52] You know, everyone that's supposed to be doing their job
[00:31:54] is doing their job.
[00:31:55] So that's, you know, early morning,
[00:31:57] as soon as we get into the office, around 9 a.m. to 10 a.m.
[00:32:00] We get that done into the afternoon.
[00:32:02] I have my lunch and, you know, try to make that quick.
[00:32:07] And then it's like through there from the 11 a.m. mark, really.
[00:32:11] Even before lunch, I would say, is when the phones really start
[00:32:15] going off, it's, you know, whether I'm putting out fires
[00:32:17] from a client who just moved into their apartment
[00:32:20] or having to manage a landlord's expectations
[00:32:22] or a seller's expectations on when are we closing, you know,
[00:32:26] figuring out a board package situation
[00:32:29] or are we getting clear to close?
[00:32:31] Are we, are we, are we accepted?
[00:32:33] Are we under contract now?
[00:32:35] And then, you know, we go into managing my agents stuff.
[00:32:39] It's just, it's just a bunch of stuff.
[00:32:41] I, it's hard for me to even just structure it into a timeframe,
[00:32:45] but it's just non-stop working until I am able to, you know,
[00:32:50] I try to get out of the office, you know, before sunset,
[00:32:54] so I could see my kid.
[00:32:55] But if I'm not doing that, then I'm meeting,
[00:32:58] I'm, I'm, I'm either meeting a buyer, a seller,
[00:33:01] or I'm showing an apartment, because I, even though I'm leading
[00:33:04] my team, I still have to show
[00:33:07] because I need my skin in the game.
[00:33:09] I need to know exactly like how the market is reacting
[00:33:12] in certain ways.
[00:33:13] So I, I try to keep my capacity, like on the showing front
[00:33:17] to, you know, a minimal because I'm managing so much back end,
[00:33:21] but, but, you know, you still have to,
[00:33:24] you still have to be a face and understand
[00:33:26] how the market is moving.
[00:33:28] 100%
[00:33:28] Have you started using AI at all to with your coffee?
[00:33:34] Yeah.
[00:33:35] Yeah.
[00:33:36] Whoever says they're not using AI is, I mean,
[00:33:39] they're relying or they're just really like stubborn
[00:33:41] and afraid to, you know, try something that will
[00:33:46] streamline you.
[00:33:47] I heard a few things though.
[00:33:48] I've been watching like, I've been watching these things
[00:33:51] on YouTube where it's like, oh, if you use chat,
[00:33:53] GVT too much, you're gonna lower your MIGDLE on,
[00:33:56] you're gonna fill your brain out,
[00:33:57] in a couple of years, long time.
[00:33:58] Yeah.
[00:33:59] Killer.
[00:34:01] You know what?
[00:34:02] I use it more to like,
[00:34:04] I use it to clean up my thoughts instead of generate them.
[00:34:07] How's that?
[00:34:08] All interesting.
[00:34:09] Tell me more about that.
[00:34:11] So it's like, I, you know,
[00:34:14] my, just even speaking with you right now,
[00:34:16] like I have so much coming out, right?
[00:34:18] And it's like, how do I manage everything
[00:34:20] that I want to say effectively?
[00:34:24] And how do I do it, you know, with,
[00:34:27] with maybe like 10 clients that need a response
[00:34:29] for me within an hour?
[00:34:32] And these are, these are, these are fires.
[00:34:34] Like let's just say that,
[00:34:35] they're not just inquiries on the list.
[00:34:37] Like these are 10 fires that you need to put out.
[00:34:40] You need to just send over those bullet points
[00:34:43] to chat GVT and get those emails drafted,
[00:34:46] review the emails, remove those nuances
[00:34:48] that look like chat GVT.
[00:34:50] Right.
[00:34:50] You wrote it.
[00:34:52] Here's a cleaned up response, just remove that
[00:34:54] and send it over.
[00:34:58] Um, effectively like if you're able to set,
[00:35:01] my rule of thumb is, if you're going to use chat GVT,
[00:35:03] you better remember exactly what you're saying.
[00:35:07] Right.
[00:35:07] Because you're going to get a call from a client
[00:35:09] and they'll be like, oh, um, what about apartment 2B?
[00:35:12] I heard there's a leak there.
[00:35:13] Like what's going on?
[00:35:14] Oh, are we under contract yet?
[00:35:16] What are the deal points?
[00:35:17] Um, what are we waiting on?
[00:35:20] Uh, hold on, let me pull up the email.
[00:35:22] Like what?
[00:35:23] Like did you not, you know, like you have to be attentive.
[00:35:25] Like there's got to be zero lag time.
[00:35:27] And you have to know exactly what's coming out of your,
[00:35:30] what's coming from your name.
[00:35:32] Right.
[00:35:32] So I mean, I try to really be very attentive to everything,
[00:35:37] um, as much as possible.
[00:35:39] So yeah, I, I, I feel the same way I,
[00:35:42] I try to talk to chat GVT like an assistant
[00:35:48] and a helper, right?
[00:35:50] Like so I, I think I was working on my business plan
[00:35:52] for recruiting agents yesterday.
[00:35:55] And I was, and it's really good at things like that.
[00:35:58] Where I said, okay, help me.
[00:36:00] This is what I want to do.
[00:36:01] First of all, I asked it.
[00:36:02] Do you think it's a good idea?
[00:36:02] I'm going to try this thing.
[00:36:04] And so I think it's really good to have those conversations with it.
[00:36:07] And it is fun, but you're right.
[00:36:10] I, I, you know, we have, you do have to remember sort of what you're using it for.
[00:36:14] And also not giving it too much power
[00:36:15] where you're, it's creating content for you
[00:36:19] and you're not really in the driver's seat.
[00:36:21] And then that could be, like you said, it could be problematic.
[00:36:23] And it could be, it could be very tempting to just let it kind of write everything.
[00:36:29] And also, but it's also really fun to learn how to do,
[00:36:34] to do the prompts correctly.
[00:36:36] And it's complicated.
[00:36:37] Like if you really want to write, get a good result,
[00:36:40] you have to write a great prompt.
[00:36:41] So I've been having a lot of fun learning prompt engineering
[00:36:44] and learning how to, you know, it's like almost like a 10 part process
[00:36:48] to write a good prompt, which slows down the process a bit.
[00:36:53] But it, it gets me a lot better results.
[00:36:56] So I'm glad that you're, you're using that.
[00:36:58] And I will tell you, as somebody who has just gone through the listing
[00:37:01] and purchase of a property, I was really impressed by what it could do for me
[00:37:10] as a consumer, not, not acting as an agent.
[00:37:12] But having it act as an agent, it really, it couldn't solve for experience.
[00:37:17] That was the one thing that we still need REALTORS for no question.
[00:37:21] And thank God REALTORS are here because it doesn't know how to do that.
[00:37:25] And hopefully it never will learn how to do it.
[00:37:28] But it knew how to do a lot.
[00:37:30] And, you know, and so I think agents who aren't using it
[00:37:33] are really missing an opportunity to, you know, make their business run much smoother.
[00:37:40] Yeah, by far, I mean, I just don't see, I don't see a world where,
[00:37:48] I don't see a world where this is not, you know, helpful towards agents.
[00:37:55] It just, it has helped me tremendously with just, I don't get stuck on emails anymore.
[00:38:00] I'm a very big perfectionist.
[00:38:02] You know, I don't get stuck on, on, on thoughts and how to, you know,
[00:38:05] and, and business plans, especially like that's beautiful.
[00:38:08] Like I use that, like I'll just, I'm able to drive and be extremely productive
[00:38:12] and it's all recorded in my chat now.
[00:38:14] You know, I'm able to chat with my, you know, like, because you'll have,
[00:38:18] you know, you could have your phone call with your assistant,
[00:38:20] you could have your phone call with your wife, with your family, whatever.
[00:38:23] But you're not recording the call.
[00:38:24] It's not transcripted.
[00:38:25] It's not, you know, you'll remember some advice and it'll slip through.
[00:38:30] But chat, you be, and all that, like it could give you notifications to do
[00:38:34] stuff, like which is crazy, you know?
[00:38:37] Yeah, what I'm waiting for in this is coming.
[00:38:41] I'm sure is the, hey, DJ, this is chat,
[00:38:46] GBT speaking to me or AI speaking to me saying, hey, here's all the tasks you
[00:38:50] have to do today.
[00:38:50] I created a schedule for you, you know, like a really good assistant could do.
[00:38:56] And here's the order in which you're going to do that.
[00:38:58] If I could get that for me, oh my gosh, I would, I would pay a hefty
[00:39:03] sum to for that particular time.
[00:39:05] Well, you actually won't because you got to make sure it's cheaper than an
[00:39:08] assistant.
[00:39:09] That's true.
[00:39:10] That's a very great.
[00:39:13] I get this pitch all the time of like, hey, we'll take over your email inbox
[00:39:19] for with AI.
[00:39:20] Like I have a, there's a few companies that are really trying to do this
[00:39:23] for high volume teams.
[00:39:24] And I'm not a big fan of it because it's autopilot.
[00:39:29] I'll get thousands of emails a week.
[00:39:32] Like I am, I'm not completely absorbed in it.
[00:39:35] I set, you know, time box.
[00:39:36] Another part I kind of should have said earlier, time box are really important.
[00:39:40] You know, if I'm, you know, in a, in a zone, you know, I have, I'll have a
[00:39:44] timer on and, you know, I'll get something done within that time frame.
[00:39:48] I'm not going over one hour per, you know, time block for my emails, let's say.
[00:39:53] But yeah, I'm going to those emails.
[00:39:55] I'm making sure that there's no red flags.
[00:39:57] I'm not missing anything because, you know, with fair housing and just, you
[00:40:00] know, treating and the service industry that we're in, like we, we want to,
[00:40:04] you know, you want to do a good job, you know, good service roles.
[00:40:08] That's just how it is.
[00:40:10] I'd love to know your why because we know your, your skilled, your obviously
[00:40:15] skilled, your, your team is skilled.
[00:40:17] What gets you through the hard times?
[00:40:20] Because of course, you're running a business every, every business has hard
[00:40:23] moments and every deal has a hard moment.
[00:40:26] And what is, what is the why?
[00:40:29] What keeps you on?
[00:40:32] Well, there's a few things.
[00:40:36] Obviously, obviously we all like to make a lot of money.
[00:40:39] We can start there.
[00:40:41] I don't come from much.
[00:40:42] I don't come from nothing, but I'm not a blue blooded park,
[00:40:47] I have a new kid, I'm a queen's kid.
[00:40:50] And, you know, I want to ultimately have, you know, the best to provide
[00:40:55] for my family.
[00:40:56] And on top of all of that, it's, I have experienced very bad service.
[00:41:03] And we all do.
[00:41:05] And I've experienced very bad, I've experienced bad REALTORS when I got my
[00:41:11] apartment, you know, I don't want to, you know, I'm not putting out name or anything.
[00:41:15] I'm not that type of guy, but I've seen it.
[00:41:16] And I've worked with bad REALTORS on, you know, when I partnered on certain
[00:41:20] fuels and that, that, you know, it just, I would never let anything like that come
[00:41:29] out of my name.
[00:41:30] So when I'm working with, you know, I, I'm talking to me, really loving real
[00:41:36] state design and, and just, you know, architecture in general, like I, I really,
[00:41:42] really love making my clients happy.
[00:41:47] And I, I, that's, that's where it all stems from.
[00:41:52] I don't see longevity in this business.
[00:41:55] If you're only looking at, oh, let's just get the deal done.
[00:41:59] Call it a day, when, Ben, thank you, man.
[00:42:01] You know, like, no, like stick with the client and make your client happy.
[00:42:05] And you will have a great turnout.
[00:42:07] You will have return business.
[00:42:10] That's how I see it.
[00:42:11] So, and oftentimes I, you know, like if I have
[00:42:16] to, I don't like commission get in the way.
[00:42:22] That it's just, I care about how my client feels after the deal.
[00:42:29] Yeah.
[00:42:30] Yeah, I think, I think that makes all the sense in the world.
[00:42:34] And I've heard that answer time and time again over the years as I've had
[00:42:39] this show.
[00:42:40] And it's almost a universal response.
[00:42:42] It's like, I always wait for a different answer.
[00:42:45] And I rarely get it because it is, I just want to do the right thing for the
[00:42:50] right reason.
[00:42:51] Yeah.
[00:42:52] We could do a million different things for money.
[00:42:54] There's so many, you know, I mean, like, there are so many, you know,
[00:42:57] gray market things that could be behind a desk.
[00:42:59] I could be doing this.
[00:43:00] I love doing this.
[00:43:01] I love the, you know, that it's a win-win on top of everything.
[00:43:05] A deal, a true deal.
[00:43:06] And you learn this as deals grow, you know, it's a win-win.
[00:43:10] Both parties are extremely happy.
[00:43:13] That's the whole point of it.
[00:43:14] So everyone walks away like, like, yes, thank you.
[00:43:18] That's why that's what you strive for as a REALTOR.
[00:43:21] I feel like.
[00:43:22] Yeah.
[00:43:23] And the people who don't play nice in the sandbox are, you know, it's tough.
[00:43:28] It's tough.
[00:43:29] And not everybody does.
[00:43:31] And the people, but most of the top producers I talk to, they seem to be really
[00:43:36] cooperative, really nice, genuinely good people who, of course, you know,
[00:43:42] make just make deals much, much easier and also helps get deals closed faster.
[00:43:47] When you know the person on the other end is like, oh, that guy or that, well,
[00:43:51] that person is a fantastic, you know, agent.
[00:43:55] And I also think too, as we start to see the constriction of the market where
[00:44:00] the top agents are going to thrive and the, you know, agents who aren't really
[00:44:05] in the business that much are probably going to self-select out.
[00:44:09] I think we're going to see a higher level of service just continue on.
[00:44:13] And I think REALTORS will just going to, they're just going to do great who are,
[00:44:18] who are in this, who have this experience.
[00:44:20] And, you know, you've, you've lived in this community.
[00:44:22] I imagine it's a very compelling story to tell the residents of the area that
[00:44:29] you live in that this is, this is my domain.
[00:44:31] I live here.
[00:44:31] I work here.
[00:44:32] I know this area.
[00:44:33] This is, this is what I do.
[00:44:35] Of course, you work other areas too.
[00:44:36] But I imagine there's a sense of pride you must have.
[00:44:39] And this is where I live.
[00:44:41] This is where I work.
[00:44:42] And I imagine that that really carries you through.
[00:44:46] I mean, being born and raised in New York is like to me like, you know, it's,
[00:44:51] it's in the heart, you know, it's in the blood.
[00:44:55] And it's something that you can't take away from me.
[00:45:00] So, you know, whether you're, whether you're, you know, a transplant where you
[00:45:03] come in from another city, another state, another country, whatever, like,
[00:45:07] you're going to know that, that I know what's good around here.
[00:45:11] And that's, that's the whole point.
[00:45:13] All you got to do is tell me, give me, give me a little bit of your background.
[00:45:18] And I'll let you know what works for you.
[00:45:20] Yeah.
[00:45:21] Well, I think that's perfectly said.
[00:45:22] And we should also mention too that, of course, New York is a market that people
[00:45:27] transplant in and out of.
[00:45:29] Of course, places like Florida, places all over the country.
[00:45:33] And my sister moved there from Kansas City right out of after college.
[00:45:38] She went to Kansas City and then she says, I got to make it in New York.
[00:45:41] And so many people have that same dream and finance and all sorts of different
[00:45:46] industries, of course.
[00:45:47] And so there are a lot of our listeners who are going to have clients who have,
[00:45:52] you know, those dreams and aspirations and who do move in and out of that area.
[00:45:57] And so if there was somebody who's really jiving with, with what you say and
[00:46:02] wants to connect with you and maybe, you know, throw a referral your way and make a
[00:46:05] connection.
[00:46:06] So you guys could maybe pass referrals back and forth.
[00:46:09] Because of course, I do leave New York as well.
[00:46:11] What's the best way that they should reach out to you?
[00:46:14] You could do, you could reach out, you could text me personally.
[00:46:17] I will always respond.
[00:46:18] You could email me.
[00:46:19] I will always respond.
[00:46:21] That's, that's part of the service.
[00:46:24] You're always going to get a response from me, no matter who you are, no matter what it is.
[00:46:27] And even if it's the lowest level of a deal, you will get a response from me.
[00:46:32] Even if it's something I don't deal with, you will get a response from you on where it
[00:46:36] could be navigated.
[00:46:37] And I do give great referral fees.
[00:46:39] And I'm a very honorable person at that.
[00:46:43] Yeah.
[00:46:43] Yeah.
[00:46:44] Well, I love that.
[00:46:45] We'll have a link to Ethan's contact information in our show notes.
[00:46:50] And he's a Compass agent.
[00:46:51] He's easy to find Ethan David off.
[00:46:52] And Ethan, one last question for you.
[00:46:55] Where do you see your team going in, in like the next year?
[00:47:01] What do you, what do you, what do you think is the head for you guys?
[00:47:03] That's a good question.
[00:47:05] I wasn't prepared for this one.
[00:47:06] I wasn't prepared for most of them.
[00:47:09] But I like this question.
[00:47:11] I do have a vision.
[00:47:14] And I see us really just powering through, obviously, the portfolios that we have.
[00:47:22] That's, that's great.
[00:47:23] I see us building on that very well, maybe getting another rental portfolio or two,
[00:47:28] but really, really becoming a powerhouse in the in the resale market.
[00:47:35] downtown Williamsburg Upper East Side.
[00:47:37] That's, that's where we're really pushing.
[00:47:41] And the sprinkle of Long Island City since I'm a Queen's guy.
[00:47:44] But we are pushing hard on the resale market.
[00:47:48] The goal, the goal is in the next three to five years to get us to a $100 million
[00:47:58] producing team, you know, an annual sales.
[00:48:02] And that is on the road.
[00:48:04] Wonderful.
[00:48:05] That is an amazing goal and a super high mark, high water mark for anybody.
[00:48:11] And I, I have friends who have done that.
[00:48:14] And I've interviewed a lot of people on the show that, that do that.
[00:48:18] And it is, it is absolutely doable.
[00:48:20] And you are on your way.
[00:48:22] I mean, you're already at 100 transactions in your fifth year.
[00:48:25] That is pretty incredible.
[00:48:27] So if a David off is our guest, he has the energy, it's palpable.
[00:48:32] He cares about this industry, he cares about his clients.
[00:48:35] And he's just a good guy who is trying to provide value.
[00:48:41] And that is really the mark of pretty much all the guests we've ever had.
[00:48:47] So Ethan is no different.
[00:48:48] We are excited to talk to Ethan and have, have talked to him today.
[00:48:53] So on behalf of our audience, Ethan, thank you for spending an hour with us.
[00:48:57] You have a family, you are busy, you have a team, you spent time with us.
[00:49:00] And we thank you for that.
[00:49:02] On behalf of Ethan and myself, thank you to the audience for making it to the end of the episode.
[00:49:06] If you found value in this, and I know you did, please tell a friend,
[00:49:10] let another agent know about this episode, send him a link because
[00:49:15] Ethan had a lot of great things to say and a lot of great strategies that
[00:49:18] met help them in their business.
[00:49:20] And that helps us to get in front of more ears or eyes.
[00:49:23] So thank you for that.

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io and now onto the show. Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents. My name's DJ Paris. I'm your guide and host through the show and we've been going strong for seven years and that's all because of you. Thank you so much. I think we're over 700 episodes or close to it. So that's because of you all who are listening. So if you're new, welcome. If you're not new and been listening for years, welcome back. As always, please tell a friend. That's the best way that you can help me continue to get the show out to more people who can do more episodes. And just a moment, we're going to be speaking with top queens, producer, Ethan David off and also he's a team leader and he's going to talk about how it is to grow a team. You're going to learn so much from him. Just wait, it's an awesome conversation. And I want to tell you about switching gears for just a moment, a tool that I built for you and I need your feedback and it's super, super cool. And I'm going to have a link to it. I'm going to eventually have a way where you could just text a code and I'll send it to you. But for now, if you can go to joincal.com, which is kale like kale realty, so joincal.com and then go forward slash AI hyphen prompts with the asset, the AI prompts. I built a tool that will take any part of your business that you were looking to improve and it will actually super charge an AI prompt query for you. So you'll ask you some questions about what you want to do for your business and it will write the perfect AI query that you can copy and paste right into chat GPT because if you've ever just used chat GPT and not gotten good results, you know, maybe throw in a listing description and it ends up sounding like every other listing description or maybe you're like, I need some social media ideas or how should I prospect or how should I negotiate better and it just aren't getting the results you want. This is the tool for you, totally free. There's no registration. I just need you to tell me how it's working for you and if it's helpful. So check it out joincal.com, forward slash AI hyphen prompts and let me know what you think of it and I'm continually adding more features and it's really cool and I'm really excited to share that with you guys. We actually built it for our agents here at our firm and we thought, hey, why are we keeping it just for ourselves everyone should try it. So it's there and eventually I'll have a different way for you to access it but that's where it is for now. All right guys, let's get onto it. My conversation with Ethan Davidoff.asanjane.com Best piece of advice you've heard in real estate? Best piece of advice I've heard in real estate is, don't grow too fast. You don't want to bite off more than you can chew and you gotta let things happen organically, but obviously you wanna push the envelope, just don't grow too fast, yeah. Yeah, worst piece of advice you've received. Don't get your license, it's not worth it. You don't need it, you could still transact deals without it. You'll be fine. If I listened, I mean, I basically screwed right now. I mean, I wouldn't be where I'm at, so. And one more additional question, is AI coming for the REALTORS? This is hard to really, okay. For the lower end market. Yeah, I'm with you. I think the ones Z2Z agent is gonna struggle. And the top agents are gonna thrive. I think they're gonna kill it, yeah. There is no free lunch. And honestly, with everything, I've been doing this, we'll get into it, I guess, when you ask me more questions, but I haven't been doing this for decades, but I've seen a real shift of old brokers, versus new brokers, and there's no free lunch. No. Ethan Davidoff is our guest today, and this is a really fun one for me. I am super excited to talk more with Ethan. He's born and raised in New York City.

And we just learned that Ethan lives a five minute walk from my brother-in-law in Forest Hills, the soot, beforehand. Ethan, welcome. Oh, by the way, before you say hi, follow Ethan on Instagram. Ethan is E-I-T-H-A-N-D-A-V. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. E-I-T-H-A-N-D-A-V on Instagram. Ethan, welcome to the show. Thanks for having me, DJ. I'm so excited to talk to you. You remind me a lot of my brother-in-law, which I quite adore, who's like the greatest guy ever. He's also a real estate broker. He's on the commercial side, but he is a great guy. And so it's kind of like I'm talking to my brother-in-law. So I appreciate you and I appreciate reaching out to us and I'm super excited to talk to you. So let's start at the beginning. So how did you get into real estate? So I'm a COVID agent. I'm part of the trend that got their license during COVID. And, but I was kind of at the end of the low rate environment, so to speak. So I didn't intend on being an agent. I got out of school with a finance degree, business administration with the Baruch. And I had a lot of fun through college. I didn't get my internships in play. And I just, I started an internship after college with a small development startup. They were awesome. They gave me so much first hand experience on what it takes to redevelop these walk-up buildings and give that middle market, that new market, a nice finished product, but also that old New York charm in a really convenient neighborhood at an affordable price. So it was a great, great experience. I came into there wanting to be an underwriter, right? They looked at me, had a few conversations with me. They're like, no, you're gonna be calls. I'm like, but I have a degree. I did my, I'm a finance guy. Like, no, your sales guy, dude. And I ended up sourcing a couple of market deals for them. Within three months, I had my first deal under contract with them just without even being an agent. And it was a wonderful experience. From there, I just, I realized I'm more people facing, I wanna be with the residents. I wanna be with people. I loved working with investors. I still do. I still work with a good handful of investors. But as I was shadowing the residential rental side of their business, I said, this seems more of something I would like to do. And I got my license in the next couple months. And I started with the rental firm and the rest is history. So you've been practicing for what, less than five years? I'm in my fifth, yeah. And you're doing a hundred deals a year. That's incredible. That is truly, truly incredible. I've, I've talked to, well, we have almost a thousand agents here at our own firm here in Chicago. And I've never seen anybody do that here. And I've also rarely seen that done at all the top producers I've talked to on this podcast. It's been done, but not very commonly. So hats off to you. So our audience here is really interested in learning what you're doing and how you're doing it. And maybe some advice you might have. So let's, and you said your parents were immigrants. Where did your parents come from? They're from Uzbekistan. And my father was, he was born in Uzbekistan and then he migrated to Israel. And you know, we had, it was, it was, it was a great childhood with I guess the melting pot of all of that. Yeah. Yeah. Do you have a favorite bagel place, by the way, in in, in forestels or where you are? Or regal? OK. So I have, I have a few. OK. And so number one is utopia bagels. OK. That's in Queens. And it's not forest hills, but it's, it's, it's got my heart. It's where I go before I take off, before I leave the city. It's either utopia bagels or I go to my favorite pizza shop. And which awesome street pizza is pretty, pretty fire, actually. And then the other one is actually one that I just saw. And there's something that stuck with me about this bagel shop was, the bagel was super clean. Like it was, it was perfect. And the branding, like I just can't forget it. It was my first time there. And I, my cousin has actually, he's like, oh, you've never been there before, not, it's great. But it's expensive. I'm like, no, the branding is perfect. I'll always go back. Leon's bagels. Leon's, OK, well, shout out. I, we do not have good bagels here in Chicago. And I, I long for that. I do get to go. My brother-in-law's get to stay at his childhood condo from time to time in Forrest Hills. So I will, I will search out those places and try that. Because there, there was a good bagel place, and it's no longer there. No, I know what you're talking about on the Boulevard. Yes. Yes. I forgot the name. I don't remember. It was pretty good. It was really good. Yeah. And it's right by the express bus into the city. So you're in Midtown in like 30 minutes, you know. So. So anyway, so you started a real estate investment trust. You decided to go into brokerage. You started in rentals, which of course is very common for real estate agents in New York. And that game has really flipped, right? In the last, I don't know, a couple of years. I guess the Fair Act, which most of our listeners won't be aware of unless you are an agent in New York. But basically, for my understanding and correct me, if I'm wrong, and I might be, is that, and there's a few cities that operated this way. Boston, I think, is kind of this way as well, is that in some places, the tenant actually pays the commission, which is a big ask for a tenant, especially the most expensive place to live in the country, being either San Francisco or New York. But I don't even think in San Francisco, they pay the commission, but certainly in New York, that was the case in a lot of times. And so, brokerage really, a REALTOR's really had an uphill battle. This was a big ask. You might be, somebody might be spending $7,000 a month, and then, oh, there's another $7,000. And then there's last month's rent and all of that. So it's certainly tricky. And then legislation changed to say, hey, we're gonna basically change that now landlord pays. So, let me know, am I right about that, or is it changed a bit? Has not changed. And I mean, it is what you make of it as a broker. At the end of the day, you're in a service industry, and that should come first, no matter what. I think that to get, I mean, if you want my opinion, I don't know if you're asking me yet, but I just feel like there shouldn't have been involvement on the fair market. So to label it the fair act, I feel isn't exactly fair. But at the same time, it is incentivizing tenants to have more liquidity. And clients that have more liquidity and not be forced to throw tens of thousands away on broker fees, I get it. But at the end of the day, it's all supply and demand, right? And especially in the markets that I'm focused in, and that we really, we're really, really deep in, like West Village, Soho, these areas, they're broker-free areas for a reason. The demand is high. How do you, you know, like, but, you know, the tenant ended up paying for it at the end of the day. It didn't change anything. Right, the tenant's still paying it just in a different way. Yeah, and the landlord's making more, because what am I gonna do? Am I gonna, am I gonna like charge my landlord, you know, a high-roker fee? No. I'm gonna charge them a reasonable fee based on the amount of business that we do together. It's business, right? And would I charge a tenant a high fee if I, it's a service industry, like if a high fee will cause someone to be completely distraught while they're extremely qualified, they appear to be a great tenant, you know, like just everything adds up on paper. Would I want to, you know, stick a high fee to them? No, that's just not how I do business, you know? Yeah. So it's one of those things that sort of, it sounds cool for the tenant and then at the end of the day, they're paying it anyway. It's kind of... Do you want the numbers on my end? I'm curious, yeah, I'd love to know. So we did a numbers year over year. We managed a very large portfolio of my team and we brought up on average over 17%. Wow. Yeah. Hell's kitchen, leading. Soho and Wes Village, like, but really, like these markets, especially the No-Fee markets, where we were No-Fee, regardless, right? Shot. Like it's weird, but yeah, it obviously has a little bit to do with rent increases year over year, but mostly to do with baking in the broker fee now. And the entire market has been shaken by it. Yeah. Yeah, it's one way or another you're paying for it. Yeah, it's baked in, right? Yeah, it's probably sounds cool politically, but maybe at the end of the day, people have to get paid. So let's talk about building your business. So you're native, you're from there. And what... You know, when you think about earning some, earning business and, you know, obviously, there's tens of thousands of REALTORS. Here in Chicago, we have 46,000. I'm sure New York has even more with all the burrows of course. I am curious, like, what... How do you go about sourcing business? Well, I'm a young guy. And my team, we're, you know, around the same age, some a little older, some a little younger. I've managed a small team and mostly new agents. I have one senior agent and, you know, the rest are like two-year, one-year agents. We are very big on prospecting, just cold prospecting. We don't wait for business to come our way, because I would not be able to sustain myself with that. The phone doesn't just ring magically? No, unfortunately it doesn't. And, you know, I had to learn that the hard way, but it was, you know, the majority of my business and my team's business is sourced from cold prospecting and we run with the fact that we know this city. Yeah. You know, like, I've never met you, you know, but I know exactly where your brother-in-law lives and everything. I think we know each other, but that... You can only really get that from a native, in my opinion. So that's the differentiating factor. And above all, you're gonna get a truly white glove service. You know, the phone is always answered when, you know, when we've established the relationship. But it's about, you get the business, you follow up, follow up, follow up, follow up, you know, and then, you know, you continue to roll that snowball. Yeah. The fortune is in the follow up and as much as I wish it wasn't and I wish the fortune was in the first part. That's the hardest part. Yeah, it's the hardest part and it's all... But in a weird way, it's also best that it's better than it's done that way because most people don't do the follow up. So it's like in a weird way, it's like that expression. It's not crowded along the extra mile. Like, it just isn't. Yes, of course, there's competition. There always is and good agents are going to always, you know, be at your heels. But most agents aren't. Most agents aren't going to be at your heels. And so, you know, you guys are aggressive in a good way and I mean that with no pejorative sense, obviously a very, very positive sense. So when you say cold prospecting, tell us like, what does that look like? What does that look like for your team? Well, it looks like postcarding, emailing about, you know, neighborhood updates and, you know, we do the phone calls and stuff with clients that we've engaged with. I don't want to say cold calling or anything like that. I don't know like how that works or, you know, but we do a lot of cold prospecting. Yeah. And, you know, so, you know, the phone calls, the text, the emails, no spam. I teach everyone, we go through a full course on my team. So in order to be a part of the program, you have to go through the course of learning how to prospect without just like, like, you have to add value, you know? It's, so, and it's been paying off very well. I'm very happy about it. It's just, it's the hardest thing to do. It's like getting to the gym, right? Yes. You really don't want to do it, but face it, like, you have to. You have to do it or you're going to get fat and ugly. I know. I, every Monday, I have a trainer. And so for 42 years, I struggled to get to the gym and I rarely did. And I was always, you know, relatively fit or not overweight, but I wasn't strong and I wasn't really in shape. I just didn't look overweight. And finally, I was like 42 and I'm like, I have to get in shape. So I said, I'm going to have to get a trainer and every, I do it three times a week. And on Mondays, I do it at eight o'clock in the morning, which is brutal because I don't, like you said, I don't want to do it. There's no part of me. I want to sit on the couch and do nothing all day and not even work. I don't even want to work. Like, I just want, that's my, unfortunately, that is what my brain wants me to do. But I know that's not good for me. So I force myself to do it and, and then I get all the benefits. But all you have to do is force yourself to do it, which is not easy. I'm not saying it's easy, but you're right. It's, it's the, it's all the heavy lifting pardon the pun, but it's the heavy lifting of, of prospecting, lead gen following up. It's all the things that most people don't want to do. Yeah, and, and the other part is that you should never be afraid, right? Because like, there are so many reasons to be fearful of prospecting with someone who you've never met, you know, obviously like, it could be dangerous, but like downright dangerous, right? But you're targeting your lead, you're targeting the deal, you're adding value. The worst that happens is they say no, and you move the F on, right? And even then, like, can you continue to send market updates, and you were going to update? Is, is there, can I add value? That's literally the way that I've been able to get businesses. Not what can I make from you? Right. Can I sell your place? No, no, can I add value? I don't give a crap if you want to sell today. I don't care if you want to sell tomorrow. I don't care if you want to rent. I just want to know, like, can I help you in any way? Yeah. And when you are ready, if you are ready, I would love to be the one you use. Yeah, it's the old fashioned way of sales, earning it. You earning it. Yeah, earned it by give, give, give, give, and then hope that one day they go, you're the guy. And they will, because people always want a competent service professional who's just a good decent human being who gives, right? Like, I want my accountant to call me and go, I have this idea for you to save on to Axis, right? I want my, you know, I want people to reach out to me proactively and say, I've got a solution, you know, and when you find those people, whether it's a mechanic, whether it's a doctor, whoever, you latch onto those people, because you're like, wow, that person's good. And I love that, you know, it's taken me a long time to develop those people and I'm always readjusting the list. But boy, REALTORS no different. And I think, you know, I just currently I'm selling my condo and buying another place and upgrading because I'm engaged in going through that process. And anyway, congrats. Oh, thank you. Thank you. It's very exciting. We actually just went and saw the colors change, not too far from you. We went to main New Hampshire Vermont, just to go, you know, do that thing and that. That's really fun. But if anyone hasn't ever gone to see the colors change, most people probably haven't. Please go do that. It is so incredible. You won't believe it. But anyway, when I was going through this process and I am going through this process right now, and I am, I have a lot of friends, thankfully, in this industry who were very helpful to me, who were like, oh, you just have to do this, do this, do this, do this. And I was able to leverage those relationships to get things done in a way that was so helpful. I now have so much more respect, even though I'm in this industry for really good agents. And really good agents who provide value are just, like they don't get paid enough, I think, in some ways. Like even the agent on the other side of the transaction for the place I'm buying, he was so helpful to me, I could not believe it. I'm like, oh, that's right. It's called a cooperative commission. He was, he was, and he's a friend of mine. I mean, not a close, close friend, but he was like, oh, DG, you just have to do this. And I said, oh, thank you. Like it was very honest. It was very open. And I am so honored to sort of be, and I realized, like, oh, I couldn't do this. Like this isn't my skill set. And I'm not a practicing agent, so it shouldn't be. But I have so much respect for people who do. And that's you and your team. And you guys have just really, you talk about adding value. You guys have added so much value that you, you just take an a ton of business over the last several years when it's been pretty tricky to do that. And so I'm curious, you know, what, when you think about your clients and you're talking about adding value, you know, how do you think about staying in touch? Like obviously you say, you know, hey, maybe they're not ready today. But what are you doing to stay in touch so that they don't forget about you? Well, every situation is different, right? Obviously you get like the handwritten notes. You get the phone calls, the text. But it's the holiday messages for me. They get the texts from me, the personal texts. If I reached out to you, if we've spoken, if you know, for any reason we've ever connected, if now's not the right time, whatever it is, I always just, you know, I continue to wish you happy holidays. Every single holiday like major holiday, you know, we start with Thanksgiving, we go through Christmas, we go through New Year's, we go through the Jewish holidays, you know, everything. And I, I mean, like my wife kind of hates me for it because like every holiday like, you know, like we're off with, you know, with my kid now and you know, we're going to our families and stuff. But I'm like, babe, I need to be unbothered for like two hours and like you'll just see a bunch of blues, just texts everywhere. And that's me personally sending you a message and like truly wanting to catch up. And yeah, I mean, I manage everything through a CRM. Compass has a really good, really, like probably one of the best CRMs that I've ever used. And I'm able to manage just everything there. I treat that like basically my, my, my Bible. Yeah. You know, it's like every day you go through that. And you know, for your immediate, for your warmth, you have to have a warm list, obviously of the warm prospects. You got to stay on top of those. Those are more frequent. And then you have, you know, something that's a little colder, a little less warm, like kind of lukewarm. And you want to do those holiday, those monthly touch ups and all of that. But all in all, get to know your client, get to know your prospect. That's by number one thing, you know, besides the sale is, I want to get to know you, I want to know who you are, what, you know, get to going and, and just how, how could, how could I add value bottom line? How could I make your day? Yeah, I think, I think you're right. And there's lots of ways to do that. To developing kind of like a level of intimacy, where I'm going to be a value to you, but I also care about you. And I'm going to, you know, maybe you end up becoming friends with some of these people, of course. And it is a really fun way to get to know somebody, I think. And, and you certainly seem to have that energy. I bet you have a lot of clients that are friends now. And must be, must be a lot of fun to do that. Now, I'm curious, what is a typical day? And again, I know REALTOR days are different every day. But what is a typical day? If you were to structure your day and you had to control over it and nothing came at you to change it, you know, with family or whatever or your business, what would your typical day look like? Well, it's incredibly hard to, you know, to have full control. But as a team leader, that's the ultimate goal. That's why you hire agents to, you know, manage your business, your inflow. So, I mean, I try, I really try to stick through this, I guess, Rajaman is like, you know, you wake up. You, I try to wake up around the 7 a.m. mark, you know, get my, get my electrolytes in, get my caffeine running. If I'm not dropping off the kid in the morning to, to his daycare, I'm going straight to the gym. I gotta get the blood flowing, get the blood flowing, get into my office by, you know, the 9 a.m. range. But my phone is not off. And from the moment I wake up, I have to take the phone calls. I have to keep moving. As soon as I get into my office, you know, it's go through my to-do list. You know, you print, I print these, I keep these with me. These, you know, I got a few to-do list. This, now I need a personal one and I have the business one. And you have your, your warm leads. Like, that's just, that's what I have to have in front of me because the emails will bombard you all these little distractions. So I keep, I just make sure my to-do list is going through. I have a server with all the deal flow, with all my agents on it, and I make sure all of those messages are answered. You know, everyone that's supposed to be doing their job is doing their job. So that's, you know, early morning, as soon as we get into the office, around 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. We get that done into the afternoon. I have my lunch and, you know, try to make that quick. And then it's like through there from the 11 a.m. mark, really. Even before lunch, I would say, is when the phones really start going off, it's, you know, whether I'm putting out fires from a client who just moved into their apartment or having to manage a landlord's expectations or a seller's expectations on when are we closing, you know, figuring out a board package situation or are we getting clear to close? Are we, are we, are we accepted? Are we under contract now? And then, you know, we go into managing my agents stuff. It's just, it's just a bunch of stuff. I, it's hard for me to even just structure it into a timeframe, but it's just non-stop working until I am able to, you know, I try to get out of the office, you know, before sunset, so I could see my kid. But if I'm not doing that, then I'm meeting, I'm, I'm, I'm either meeting a buyer, a seller, or I'm showing an apartment, because I, even though I'm leading my team, I still have to show because I need my skin in the game. I need to know exactly like how the market is reacting in certain ways. So I, I try to keep my capacity, like on the showing front to, you know, a minimal because I'm managing so much back end, but, but, you know, you still have to, you still have to be a face and understand how the market is moving. 100% Have you started using AI at all to with your coffee? Yeah. Yeah. Whoever says they're not using AI is, I mean, they're relying or they're just really like stubborn and afraid to, you know, try something that will streamline you. I heard a few things though. I've been watching like, I've been watching these things on YouTube where it's like, oh, if you use chat, GVT too much, you're gonna lower your MIGDLE on, you're gonna fill your brain out, in a couple of years, long time. Yeah. Killer. You know what? I use it more to like, I use it to clean up my thoughts instead of generate them. How's that? All interesting. Tell me more about that. So it's like, I, you know, my, just even speaking with you right now, like I have so much coming out, right? And it's like, how do I manage everything that I want to say effectively? And how do I do it, you know, with, with maybe like 10 clients that need a response for me within an hour? And these are, these are, these are fires. Like let's just say that, they're not just inquiries on the list. Like these are 10 fires that you need to put out. You need to just send over those bullet points to chat GVT and get those emails drafted, review the emails, remove those nuances that look like chat GVT. Right. You wrote it. Here's a cleaned up response, just remove that and send it over. Um, effectively like if you're able to set, my rule of thumb is, if you're going to use chat GVT, you better remember exactly what you're saying. Right. Because you're going to get a call from a client and they'll be like, oh, um, what about apartment 2B? I heard there's a leak there. Like what's going on? Oh, are we under contract yet? What are the deal points? Um, what are we waiting on? Uh, hold on, let me pull up the email. Like what? Like did you not, you know, like you have to be attentive. Like there's got to be zero lag time. And you have to know exactly what's coming out of your, what's coming from your name. Right. So I mean, I try to really be very attentive to everything, um, as much as possible. So yeah, I, I, I feel the same way I, I try to talk to chat GVT like an assistant and a helper, right? Like so I, I think I was working on my business plan for recruiting agents yesterday. And I was, and it's really good at things like that. Where I said, okay, help me. This is what I want to do. First of all, I asked it. Do you think it's a good idea? I'm going to try this thing. And so I think it's really good to have those conversations with it. And it is fun, but you're right. I, I, you know, we have, you do have to remember sort of what you're using it for. And also not giving it too much power where you're, it's creating content for you and you're not really in the driver's seat. And then that could be, like you said, it could be problematic. And it could be, it could be very tempting to just let it kind of write everything. And also, but it's also really fun to learn how to do, to do the prompts correctly. And it's complicated. Like if you really want to write, get a good result, you have to write a great prompt. So I've been having a lot of fun learning prompt engineering and learning how to, you know, it's like almost like a 10 part process to write a good prompt, which slows down the process a bit. But it, it gets me a lot better results. So I'm glad that you're, you're using that. And I will tell you, as somebody who has just gone through the listing and purchase of a property, I was really impressed by what it could do for me as a consumer, not, not acting as an agent. But having it act as an agent, it really, it couldn't solve for experience. That was the one thing that we still need REALTORS for no question. And thank God REALTORS are here because it doesn't know how to do that. And hopefully it never will learn how to do it. But it knew how to do a lot. And, you know, and so I think agents who aren't using it are really missing an opportunity to, you know, make their business run much smoother. Yeah, by far, I mean, I just don't see, I don't see a world where, I don't see a world where this is not, you know, helpful towards agents. It just, it has helped me tremendously with just, I don't get stuck on emails anymore. I'm a very big perfectionist. You know, I don't get stuck on, on, on thoughts and how to, you know, and, and business plans, especially like that's beautiful. Like I use that, like I'll just, I'm able to drive and be extremely productive and it's all recorded in my chat now. You know, I'm able to chat with my, you know, like, because you'll have, you know, you could have your phone call with your assistant, you could have your phone call with your wife, with your family, whatever. But you're not recording the call. It's not transcripted. It's not, you know, you'll remember some advice and it'll slip through. But chat, you be, and all that, like it could give you notifications to do stuff, like which is crazy, you know? Yeah, what I'm waiting for in this is coming. I'm sure is the, hey, DJ, this is chat, GBT speaking to me or AI speaking to me saying, hey, here's all the tasks you have to do today. I created a schedule for you, you know, like a really good assistant could do. And here's the order in which you're going to do that. If I could get that for me, oh my gosh, I would, I would pay a hefty sum to for that particular time. Well, you actually won't because you got to make sure it's cheaper than an assistant. That's true. That's a very great. I get this pitch all the time of like, hey, we'll take over your email inbox for with AI. Like I have a, there's a few companies that are really trying to do this for high volume teams. And I'm not a big fan of it because it's autopilot. I'll get thousands of emails a week. Like I am, I'm not completely absorbed in it. I set, you know, time box. Another part I kind of should have said earlier, time box are really important. You know, if I'm, you know, in a, in a zone, you know, I have, I'll have a timer on and, you know, I'll get something done within that time frame. I'm not going over one hour per, you know, time block for my emails, let's say. But yeah, I'm going to those emails. I'm making sure that there's no red flags. I'm not missing anything because, you know, with fair housing and just, you know, treating and the service industry that we're in, like we, we want to, you know, you want to do a good job, you know, good service roles. That's just how it is. I'd love to know your why because we know your, your skilled, your obviously skilled, your, your team is skilled. What gets you through the hard times? Because of course, you're running a business every, every business has hard moments and every deal has a hard moment. And what is, what is the why? What keeps you on? Well, there's a few things. Obviously, obviously we all like to make a lot of money. We can start there. I don't come from much. I don't come from nothing, but I'm not a blue blooded park, I have a new kid, I'm a queen's kid. And, you know, I want to ultimately have, you know, the best to provide for my family. And on top of all of that, it's, I have experienced very bad service. And we all do. And I've experienced very bad, I've experienced bad REALTORS when I got my apartment, you know, I don't want to, you know, I'm not putting out name or anything. I'm not that type of guy, but I've seen it. And I've worked with bad REALTORS on, you know, when I partnered on certain fuels and that, that, you know, it just, I would never let anything like that come out of my name. So when I'm working with, you know, I, I'm talking to me, really loving real state design and, and just, you know, architecture in general, like I, I really, really love making my clients happy. And I, I, that's, that's where it all stems from. I don't see longevity in this business. If you're only looking at, oh, let's just get the deal done. Call it a day, when, Ben, thank you, man. You know, like, no, like stick with the client and make your client happy. And you will have a great turnout. You will have return business. That's how I see it. So, and oftentimes I, you know, like if I have to, I don't like commission get in the way. That it's just, I care about how my client feels after the deal. Yeah. Yeah, I think, I think that makes all the sense in the world. And I've heard that answer time and time again over the years as I've had this show. And it's almost a universal response. It's like, I always wait for a different answer. And I rarely get it because it is, I just want to do the right thing for the right reason. Yeah. We could do a million different things for money. There's so many, you know, I mean, like, there are so many, you know, gray market things that could be behind a desk. I could be doing this. I love doing this. I love the, you know, that it's a win-win on top of everything. A deal, a true deal. And you learn this as deals grow, you know, it's a win-win. Both parties are extremely happy. That's the whole point of it. So everyone walks away like, like, yes, thank you. That's why that's what you strive for as a REALTOR. I feel like. Yeah. And the people who don't play nice in the sandbox are, you know, it's tough. It's tough. And not everybody does. And the people, but most of the top producers I talk to, they seem to be really cooperative, really nice, genuinely good people who, of course, you know, make just make deals much, much easier and also helps get deals closed faster. When you know the person on the other end is like, oh, that guy or that, well, that person is a fantastic, you know, agent. And I also think too, as we start to see the constriction of the market where the top agents are going to thrive and the, you know, agents who aren't really in the business that much are probably going to self-select out. I think we're going to see a higher level of service just continue on. And I think REALTORS will just going to, they're just going to do great who are, who are in this, who have this experience. And, you know, you've, you've lived in this community. I imagine it's a very compelling story to tell the residents of the area that you live in that this is, this is my domain. I live here. I work here. I know this area. This is, this is what I do. Of course, you work other areas too. But I imagine there's a sense of pride you must have. And this is where I live. This is where I work. And I imagine that that really carries you through. I mean, being born and raised in New York is like to me like, you know, it's, it's in the heart, you know, it's in the blood. And it's something that you can't take away from me. So, you know, whether you're, whether you're, you know, a transplant where you come in from another city, another state, another country, whatever, like, you're going to know that, that I know what's good around here. And that's, that's the whole point. All you got to do is tell me, give me, give me a little bit of your background. And I'll let you know what works for you. Yeah. Well, I think that's perfectly said. And we should also mention too that, of course, New York is a market that people transplant in and out of. Of course, places like Florida, places all over the country. And my sister moved there from Kansas City right out of after college. She went to Kansas City and then she says, I got to make it in New York. And so many people have that same dream and finance and all sorts of different industries, of course. And so there are a lot of our listeners who are going to have clients who have, you know, those dreams and aspirations and who do move in and out of that area. And so if there was somebody who's really jiving with, with what you say and wants to connect with you and maybe, you know, throw a referral your way and make a connection. So you guys could maybe pass referrals back and forth. Because of course, I do leave New York as well. What's the best way that they should reach out to you? You could do, you could reach out, you could text me personally. I will always respond. You could email me. I will always respond. That's, that's part of the service. You're always going to get a response from me, no matter who you are, no matter what it is. And even if it's the lowest level of a deal, you will get a response from me. Even if it's something I don't deal with, you will get a response from you on where it could be navigated. And I do give great referral fees. And I'm a very honorable person at that. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I love that. We'll have a link to Ethan's contact information in our show notes. And he's a Compass agent. He's easy to find Ethan David off. And Ethan, one last question for you.

I wasn't prepared for most of them. But I like this question. I do have a vision. And I see us really just powering through, obviously, the portfolios that we have. That's, that's great. I see us building on that very well, maybe getting another rental portfolio or two, but really, really becoming a powerhouse in the in the resale market. downtown Williamsburg Upper East Side. That's, that's where we're really pushing. And the sprinkle of Long Island City since I'm a Queen's guy. But we are pushing hard on the resale market. The goal, the goal is in the next three to five years to get us to a $100 million producing team, you know, an annual sales. And that is on the road. Wonderful.
