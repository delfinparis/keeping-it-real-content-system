[00:02:13] to book a call with me or send me an email. Today we're talking about business
[00:02:18] financials for REALTORS. This is like my favorite topic. I love money, I love finances,
[00:02:25] I'm obsessed. How many people have you ever heard approach finances or money that way?
[00:02:31] Probably not many. Most people are afraid of their money. Most people don't even want to talk
[00:02:38] about it. Much less deal with it. That is not only super unhealthy, also super anxiety inducing,
[00:02:46] but thirdly and most importantly, not very productive in the long run. If you are afraid of your
[00:02:53] money, if you are not actively controlling your money, your money is controlling you. I'm going
[00:02:59] to give you the tips and the tricks that you need to make sure that you can harness that control
[00:03:04] and be in charge of your business and your money. Let's dive in. Whether you are an independent agent
[00:03:12] or part of a real estate team or having a solid understanding of financial principles is essential
[00:03:19] for long-term success. I don't care if you are a brand new agent or you've been an agent for 25
[00:03:24] years. This is key, no matter what. In order for you to take it to the next level, you need to have
[00:03:32] a grasp on your finances. This is likely the difference between accomplishing your goals and just
[00:03:38] simply surviving or worse, flondering and debt. So no matter where you are in your business journey,
[00:03:46] financial management is super important. Financial and management involves the strategic
[00:03:50] planning, organizing, directing, and controlling of financial activities within a business.
[00:03:58] Notice the word controlling. This is key here. If you are not controlling your money, your money
[00:04:06] is controlling you. For REALTORS, this encompasses managing income, expenses, taxes and investments,
[00:04:15] all with the overarching goal of maximizing profitability and maintaining financial health.
[00:04:38] If you miss any of these, it's like working your butt off at the gym and then going home and eating a
[00:04:44] tub of Ben and Jerry's ice cream. So to be financially healthy overall, you need to have
[00:04:51] complete control over all of these things. And I'm going to help you do just that. So let's start
[00:04:57] with tracking income and commissions. So the primary source of income for REALTORS is typically
[00:05:03] commissions earned on real estate transactions. It's crucial that you track this income accurately,
[00:05:10] accounting for commission splits, referral fees, and any additional sources of revenue.
[00:05:15] So make sure that you have a system in place to ensure timely and comprehensive recording of your
[00:05:20] earnings as this forms the basis for managing your financials effectively. Okay, this is step one.
[00:05:27] Make sure you know what's coming in and keep track because if you don't, you're going to lose
[00:05:33] side of it and you might miss a referral, you might miss a closing, you might be underpaid and not
[00:05:39] even realize it if you're not making an effort to track it and stay on top of these things.
[00:05:44] Next up is expense management. In the real estate business, various expenses can arise,
[00:05:50] including advertising costs, professional fees, office supplies, technology subscriptions,
[00:05:56] and travel expenses. It's important to meticulously track and categorize these expenses to gain
[00:06:02] insight into your operational costs. By doing so, you can identify areas for cost optimization and
[00:06:09] ensure that your business remains financially sustainable. Okay, this is super important.
[00:06:16] You need to not just track your expenses, but you need to have an understanding of them.
[00:06:21] Let's say you're a brand new agent and you're bringing in $35,000 in your first year.
[00:06:27] And you decide that in order to take your business up a notch, you need to go to a conference,
[00:06:32] which I'm always going to advocate for. If it fits into your budget, if you can,
[00:06:39] afford it, which means that you can't go drop $2,000 on a ticket and spend $5,000 on the hotel
[00:06:51] and then another $1,000 on airfare. It just does not add up. You can't be spending that kind of
[00:06:57] money when you're only making $35,000 in income. Okay, so keep that in mind. Maybe you need to find a
[00:07:03] local, a local conference. Maybe you need to figure out you need to stay at a cheaper hotel or
[00:07:10] bunk up with somebody or not fly and drive. So many ways that you can get around this and still end
[00:07:16] up in the same place and still go to an amazing conference that will change your business
[00:07:22] without that overhead cost. Okay, and that's just an example. You need to look at what you're spending
[00:07:28] and make sure that it adds up to an income-producing activity. Make sure that it's leading to something
[00:07:34] that's going to turn into more income, especially when it comes to advertising.
[00:07:39] Okay, so if you are not tracking your expenses, your money will disappear.
[00:07:46] Next up is budgeting and forecasting. So you want to create a budget and financial forecast
[00:07:52] as part of your financial management plan. Establishing a budget allows you to plan for expenses
[00:07:58] cycles for savings and allocate funds for business growth and development. This is where your
[00:08:03] advertising budget comes from, your ability to hire an assistant, your, you can order marketing
[00:08:10] materials here, and this is essentially how you scale and how you grow and how you level up
[00:08:17] this right here, budgeting and forecasting. Meanwhile, forecasting helps you anticipate future
[00:08:22] revenue streams and expenses, aiding and proactive decision-making and risk management.
[00:08:29] So what does that mean? You anticipate this is what money is going to come up in the future alongside
[00:08:35] the idea of what you're going to have to budget for and that helps you make decisions
[00:08:40] and that helps you also to not take unnecessary risks. So going back to the example of going to
[00:08:47] a conference. If you know that you don't have any closings in the next two months and your,
[00:08:54] your checking account is pretty much at zero, then don't go spending a bunch of money on a conference
[00:09:00] or don't go spending a bunch of money on anything. You need to have that income coming in and planned
[00:09:05] for before you start having money come out. Next up is tax planning and compliance. Understanding
[00:09:14] tax obligations and planning accordingly is next level stuff. This is what separates the business owners
[00:09:20] from the independent contractors. What do I mean by that? It's kind of having a hard time articulating
[00:09:26] this. So I asked Chappie Chat, I asked Chat GPT and this is what I got. A 1099 employee is an individual
[00:09:36] who works as a self-employed contractor while a business owner is someone who owns and operates
[00:09:41] their own business, which may include hiring 1099 employees or other employees as needed.
[00:09:47] So ask yourself, what do you want to be? Do you want to be an employee or someone who operates your
[00:09:52] own business? I imagine that if you're here listening to this, you want to operate your own business
[00:09:59] or maybe you already are. Hopefully you already are. The difference between those two individuals is
[00:10:04] that business owners plan for taxes. They don't just do their taxes. They're aware of tax
[00:10:10] of deductible expenses, tax credits and any specific tax regulations that apply to real estate
[00:10:17] professionals. If you haven't already done so, you need to consult with and eventually hire a
[00:10:23] tax professional to optimize your tax strategy and ensure compliance with local, state and federal
[00:10:29] laws. I promise you if you find the right one, they will cost you much less than they will save you.
[00:10:36] All right, next up, investment strategies. As your real estate business grows, you may have surplus
[00:10:42] funds that could be strategically invested to generate additional income. Explore investment options
[00:10:48] such as real estate properties, stocks, bonds or retirement accounts. Developing a well-considered
[00:10:55] investment strategy aligns with your long-term financial goals and can diversify and add to your
[00:11:00] existing revenue streams. This is truly what will make you be able to enjoy your life and retire
[00:11:09] as a REALTOR is having multiple streams of income. You're already in the real estate industry,
[00:11:15] you know that real estate appreciates. This is a great opportunity for you to build some wealth and
[00:11:21] build some cash flow each month. Other things you can do are most brokerages pay you profit share
[00:11:28] or revenue share for introducing agents to your brokerage. I know at eXp we have an exceptional
[00:11:33] revenue share model and this is a huge income stream for me and allows it will allow me to retire
[00:11:39] someday as a REALTOR. Most people won't be able to retire as a REALTOR because as soon as your
[00:11:44] transactions stop you're no longer going to get paid. So you need to have something to fill that
[00:11:51] income gap. Otherwise you're not going to have a plan for retirement. Okay. So the more
[00:11:59] income streams you can have the more you're going to be able to enjoy your life, relax in your life
[00:12:04] and take control of your life because you'll have money coming in from a multitude of your places.
[00:12:11] So one dries up or one doesn't work out. You still have all these other ones you can rely on.
[00:12:16] If you want to talk more specifically about this, this is my life's passion. Please send me an
[00:12:20] email. Again, you guys can check me out at BC Global Investments.com, Ford slash Keeping It Real.
[00:12:26] There's a link on there to send me an email. You can book a call with me and love to chat about this
[00:12:30] with you. I'd love to chat about any of this with you. All right. Next up we're going to talk about
[00:12:35] debt management. If you have debt, managing debt is a critical aspect of financial health.
[00:12:41] Whether it's a business loan, a mortgage, credit card debt, you need to understand what you owe,
[00:12:45] your interest rates and repayment schedule. Developing a plan to minimize and manage debt effectively
[00:12:52] will positively impact your financial stability and long-term growth. Guys, debt is crippling.
[00:12:59] If you are constantly having to pay off commercial credit card debts, you are working backward.
[00:13:07] This, I think, is probably the first thing you need to do on your entire journey is pay down
[00:13:13] this debt. You probably shouldn't be investing in something that promises a six to maybe 12% return
[00:13:19] on a good day. When you have 18% credit card debt, pay that off first. Then you'll have more money
[00:13:27] to invest and then your money will grow instead of you working backward every single month.
[00:13:33] All right. So in conclusion, a strong gas, a strong grasp of financial management is the only way
[00:13:41] of REALTOR can sustain success in this industry. By meticulously tracking income and expenses,
[00:13:47] budgeting effectively, ensuring tax compliance, strategizing investments, and managing debt
[00:13:51] diligently, you can maintain financial stability and position your business for long-term growth.
[00:13:57] Which is what it's all about. That's it for today. Remember to check out BC Global Investments.com
