[00:01:15] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:18] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:22] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:24] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:26] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:29] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:31] Well, what if I were to tell you
[00:01:33] there's a recruiting and retention tool
[00:01:34] powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:36] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:40] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:42] and which agents at your own firm
[00:01:45] are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:47] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:50] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:52] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:55] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:56] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:01:59] for each agent in your market
[00:02:01] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:05] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:06] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:09] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:11] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:13] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:16] based on that agent's needs
[00:02:17] and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:19] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:21] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:23] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:25] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:28] corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:31] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.

[00:02:52] Hello.
[00:02:52] Hello.
[00:02:52] Hello, people.
[00:02:53] You're listeners.
[00:02:53] I'm very excited to join you today.
[00:02:55] My name is Kimberly Bergen.
[00:02:56] I'm going to be teaching you all about
[00:02:58] how to position yourself as the mayor of the town,
[00:03:02] the go to agent, the expert in your field.
[00:03:06] For those of you who don't know me,
[00:03:07] my name is Sandra.
[00:03:07] 
[00:03:07] 
[00:03:07] 
[00:03:07] Kim Rittberg and I coach Real Estate Agents around the country on how to leverage video to build up
[00:03:13] your business, bringing more buyers, more sellers, be seen as they go to agent in your area.
[00:03:19] I recently spoke at Exit Realty keynote, the California Association of REALTORS, Inman Connect,
[00:03:28] Next Home. Anyway, a whole lot of wonderful Real Estate conventions. I love, love, love, love,
[00:03:37] teenagers, and then I shifted into digital and social media. So I launched the video unit for
[00:03:42] Us Weekly Magazine and I worked at Netflix. So really, I helped people build themselves
[00:03:46] as experts, experts in their fields, and I showed them how to make content that converts, and now I
[00:03:52] do that for agents around the country. So let's dive in. One of the things is really, really important.
[00:03:57] I teach my five Cs when I do keynotes. One of them I want to dig into today is credibility.
[00:04:03] How do you seem like an expert in the way to do that is through credibility. The important part
[00:04:08] to remember though, it doesn't matter if you're brand new or if you've been doing this for 20 years.
[00:04:12] So I'm going to take this back to, I was a TV producer in the beginning of my career, and part of my
[00:04:17] job was to decide who gets to be on camera and who doesn't, who gets to be situated as an expert on TV
[00:04:22] and who doesn't. So really identifying who is like being, whose voice being amplified is something
[00:04:33] that was really, really important to me, and I find really necessary to really be focusing on that,
[00:04:39] to say how do we position ourselves as an expert? How do we show the world that not only do we love
[00:04:45] what we're doing, but we're super duper experienced, right? And so a part of that is really leading with
[00:04:52] credibility. So what does that mean? Okay, so much we think about oh well, to be credible, I have to have
[00:04:57] you know, you know, 50 million dollars sold, 100 million dollars sold, a billion dollars, whatever.
[00:05:02] I have to be doing this for 20 years, 30 years, 10 years, but the truth is you can build up your
[00:05:06] credibility whether you're just starting out or if you've been doing it for 25 years. And people
[00:05:11] are giving you such a large investment. It's such a, it's such an important relationship you're
[00:05:16] building that they need to not only like you, but they obviously need to also trust you with this
[00:05:21] huge investment. So part of that is really making sure they're clear that they're excited to work with
[00:05:24] you, that you're a good steward of their investment. So that is all about building up that credibility.
[00:05:29] So what does that look like, right? So if your experience you've been doing this for a long time, I'm going to
[00:05:35] recommend different types of videos to do versus new agents. And I've had agents come to me. I have this
[00:05:41] coaching program called Video Bootcamp. It's a live small group coaching program for agents around the
[00:05:47] country. And I've had agents come in who are brand new within a month, got four new calls.
[00:05:53] Because we're focusing on that credibility or expert type of content, I've had agents who've
[00:05:58] been in there for 20 years, getting million dollar referral deals specifically through videos we've
[00:06:02] made. So on both ends of it, you can really, really show people that you are credible and knowledgeable.
[00:06:08] So don't be psyched out if you're not super experienced and don't be psyched out if people in the
[00:06:16] video because I've been doing this so long and it's only for the younger people. That's not true,
[00:06:19] right? Video can be for anyone. That's what I love about teaching people about video. It's really
[00:06:23] just about bringing your knowledge to the camera. And if you're struggling with getting on video,
[00:06:28] message me. I have some really amazing free tips on how to feel more confident on camera.
[00:06:32] So let's dive into some ideas that you can use to position yourself for credibility. So
[00:06:37] for if you've been doing this for years, I love the idea of behind the scenes of a deal. So taking
[00:06:43] people through actually what did a deal look like? The key to this is really not making it too inside
[00:06:50] baseball, inside baseball, meaning don't get to in the weeds. I'm actually typing this as I do.
[00:06:55] You don't want to get to in the weeds of this, right? A top level like I had one client come to me
[00:07:00] and he said he saved somebody a hundred thousand dollars off of a purchase. I was like, oh my god,
[00:07:05] tell me about how you did that, right? So you really want to at the very high level share how you
[00:07:11] saved someone a bunch of money or share how you sold someone's home in two weeks. You really,
[00:07:16] but you don't want to get so involved that someone can't follow along. So that's also a great way to
[00:07:21] use chat GBT. So if you're having a hard time distilling down your storytelling, you can voice memo
[00:07:27] it, put it into chat GBT and then say, build me a short video script for this or build me a short
[00:07:33] post for this. So that's a really great way to use chat GBT. Cool. Next, next, next. Case studies. So
[00:07:41] the deal. Another great one to do. And this is whether you've been doing this for a long time or if
[00:07:46] you're new, new neighborhoods or neighborhoods, people should consider. So you're selling not just a
[00:07:51] home, but a lifestyle, right? You're selling that area, you're selling like that corner, that block,
[00:07:56] that neighborhood. So really bring in the neighborhoods, your favorite things in the areas. So
[00:08:01] you're positioning yourself as the mayor of that town. Another great thing you can talk about is
[00:08:06] renovations getting the most like resale value, like what's the most valuable. The key to this is
[00:08:11] really making it not just something that they can Google, but really kind of keeping it more
[00:08:15] hyper local. What you're seeing or investing, putting into that content, what you're seeing. So
[00:08:21] you're again, you're kind of like reminding people of doing all this work. This is from my experience,
[00:08:26] right? So I think that's really, really important is to is to kind of share that aspect that it's
[00:08:33] clearly from your experience. And that's why I especially like the behind the scenes of the
[00:08:37] behind the scenes of the deal is because it shows you have business, right? So it sort of does a double
[00:08:43] double thing of showing you as an expert and also like bragging a little bit about you without you
[00:08:47] bragging. Okay. Another other things that you can do. So if you're less experienced, you kind of
[00:08:52] newer, you can do a little bit more of the life day in the life of an agent, right? Showing people
[00:08:56] how hard you're working, how busy you are, you're going to the houses, you know, you can use footage
[00:09:01] of homes, even if they're not your listings, obviously. So, you know, you can be showing what you're
[00:09:05] doing throughout the day, even if you haven't been doing this for that long. Another idea that you
[00:09:11] can do, and I have a caveat here as well, market trends and updates. My biggest lesson on this is
[00:09:18] if you're going to do market trends, which I think is great, especially for new agents, because you
[00:09:22] can show that you're knowledgeable and that you're smart without having a whole book of business to
[00:09:26] support. Do not give viewers homework. By that, I mean, I sometimes see market updates and I'll say
[00:09:33] to my clients, my real estate agent clients, I don't want to see that chart, right? That chart for
[00:09:37] a regular person is homework. It's it's high school maths of them. So instead, I want to hear you take
[00:09:42] away the most important three facts from the market update. I want you to say it to them in plain
[00:09:47] English. Okay. Neighborhood tour, we talked about that a little bit before about really bringing
[00:09:53] people in through the neighborhood tour. Another one that I love is what you can get for X dollars
[00:09:59] here versus there. So that can be what you can get for 250K in this area versus that area, what you
[00:10:06] can get for $2 million in this area versus that area. And it's really kind of putting people into
[00:10:09] perspective of like it's, you know, really checking what they're doing, but it's also really showing
[00:10:14] that you're knowledgeable that you have this broad knowledge of the area that you really can help
[00:10:19] guide them. You understand the pricing and all of that. So here are a couple of things to leverage
[00:10:24] your credibility. Of course, we have, you know, you can always be sharing how much you've sold, right?
[00:10:30] Sold X millions this year, been ranked X number in my area. If you have been featured in any local
[00:10:36] papers or national papers, you should always mention that. So again, you really want to remind people,
[00:10:40] this is who I am. I'm a really good partner. Not only do I love this and I can be loyal and trust
[00:10:45] worthy and I'm really work hard for you, but I'm the person, right? I'm the person you should be
[00:10:50] trusting. So I'd love to know if you put these in practice. I'd love for you to tag me. I'm at
[00:10:55] Kim Ritberg K-I-M-R-I-T-T-P-E-R-G. And if I'd love for you to reach out and say hi, I love the
[00:11:01] keeping it real listeners. I'm on YouTube at Kim Ritberg Content and on Instagram, LinkedIn,
[00:11:06] Facebook, at Kim Ritberg. And I have a free download. The news every agent should make. So make sure to
[00:11:12] grab that from me. Just message me and I'll send that on over to you. And I hope you're doing
[00:11:16] great and I hope your business is going awesome. Please tag me and let me know how you're going to use
[00:11:20] this. Thanks so much.
