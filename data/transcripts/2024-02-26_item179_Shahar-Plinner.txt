[00:03:22] Shahar Plinner before we get to Shahar.

[00:04:10] Please support our sponsors as well.
[00:04:12] But guys, let's dive right in.
[00:04:13] My conversation with Shahar Plinner.
[00:04:28] Hey, today on the show, my guest is tax guru Shahar Plinner from Formations Court.
[00:04:36] Let me tell you more about Shahar.
[00:04:38] Now, Shahar Plinner is an entrepreneur and a tax expert on a mission to disrupt the status quo for real estate agents.
[00:04:45] 18 years ago, Shahar moved from Israel to Seattle and founded, scaled and sold a leading tax and accounting firm with the presence in Seattle, Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv.
[00:04:56] Now, during this time, he developed a playbook specifically for 1099 agents, which inspired the launch of formations today as co founder and CEO of Formations Court.
[00:05:06] Shahar continues to champion the cause.
[00:05:09] Formations is a tax management solution for the self employed and powers real estate agents to save thousands on taxes annually, make better financial decision and democratizes access to corporate level benefits such as quality and affordable healthcare as well as easy to implement retirement solutions.
[00:05:27] I want everybody, everybody, even if you have an account to go visit Formations Corp.com.
[00:05:33] Guess what? I have an accountant. I'm going to check it out because even if you do have an accountant, you may not have the perfect account for your situation.
[00:05:40] So go to FormationsCorp.com and learn more Shahar. Welcome to the show.
[00:05:46] Hey, DJ, thank you so much for having me. It's a pleasure.
[00:05:49] Well, this is, this is really embarrassing because I'll pull back the curtain on the show.
[00:05:53] So oftentimes I get to the episode just a few minutes before we're recording and my team puts all the notes together.
[00:06:00] So soon as we got on, I was chatting with Shahar before we started and I said, boy, that sounds like an Israeli accent.
[00:06:07] And then I asked him, I go, was, you know, is that Israeli? He said, oh, yeah, yeah, it is.
[00:06:11] And then sure enough, it's right there in the bio that I was going to read two minutes later.
[00:06:14] So Charles, like, well, this guy does no preparation for the show.
[00:06:18] So I apologize.
[00:06:20] Again, it's behind the scenes thing.
[00:06:22] But anyway, super excited to have you because right now it's towards the end of February, 2024.
[00:06:27] We are right coming up on tax season.
[00:06:30] It's already tax season.
[00:06:32] And this is the time for REALTORS to start thinking about their expenses.
[00:06:37] And of course, all the money they're either going to get back or they have to pay in to Uncle Sam.
[00:06:43] So really excited to have you.
[00:06:44] I think this may be the first time in 550 episodes we've ever had a tax guru on specifically for REALTORS.
[00:06:53] So really appreciate you being here.
[00:06:57] And let's get started with, you know, how did you, you've been in taxes for quite some time?
[00:07:03] How did you get into taxes?
[00:07:04] What, what was your path there?
[00:07:06] My path was, how can I be as far away as possible from my family owned business?
[00:07:13] You know, as someone in the corrupt, in a family owned business, only, you know,
[00:07:16] someone that's been there can understand, you know, the dynamic of being, you know,
[00:07:21] working for your dad, your mom, your brother, your sister, and have all of these
[00:07:27] co-mingering of emotions, you know, between, you know, how do I separate my dad, my parents from, you know, working.
[00:07:35] It's impossible.
[00:07:36] So me is the youngest, basically, a family of three boys and I'm the youngest.
[00:07:41] I rebel and basically, you know, made a decision that I'm no longer part of the family owned business.
[00:07:46] And I look for something in finance, something in numbers.
[00:07:50] And I don't know, it was, you know, it was, I couldn't explain how basically I came, you know, into the tax world.
[00:07:57] But basically, you know, I got an introduction to a person that basically showed me the tax world, the US tax world.
[00:08:06] And I find it amazing, you know, it's a whole world of opportunities and possibilities.
[00:08:13] And I think me as a service provider in nature put myself kind of the mission to be the extension or basic to be the liaison between the systems.
[00:08:26] You know, that speaks sometimes such a complicated language.
[00:08:29] And me as, you know, English my second language, I'm speaking Hebrew fluent.
[00:08:35] I had to basically use my whole English vocabulary, you know, to democratize.
[00:08:42] A tax code to the audience and it worked.
[00:08:46] It kept it super simple, super engaged.
[00:08:49] And being in taxes, you always feel that you're kind of robbing hood, you know, you're the good side of the government allowing people the access to the knowledge and basically to show them what is really possible.
[00:09:05] And what we're telling people about taxes, you know, and I love your kind of keep it real.
[00:09:10] It's real, you know, the savings and the things that you can actually enjoy from the system is real translate in more money in your pocket.
[00:09:21] So I love, you know, the concept of taxes, I see taxes, you know, I come really, you know, unfortunate to see something complicated that most people are really struggling with.
[00:09:33] And then when I start my journey, I just, you know, I felt I'm in my soul, I'm with my people, you know, and this was kind of the foundation of, you know, my journey in taxes.
[00:09:47] And if I can stay in taxes for the rest of my life, you know, this is what I want to do.
[00:09:53] Well, we're going to be paying taxes for the rest of our lives.
[00:09:55] So it makes sense. It's one of those, you know, those jobs that when, and also it's one of those jobs that, you know, it's like a dentist.
[00:10:03] They're just always going to be needed until maybe there's robots to do everything else.
[00:10:07] But until that time, and even even, and really quite frankly, there are robots right now that's to do taxes.
[00:10:13] We've had, you know, automated tax software, tax software solutions for gosh, probably 20 plus years more than that.
[00:10:20] I'm sure, but the a good accountant can see through a lot of what the algorithmic, you know, software solutions can't.
[00:10:30] And so I know too that when I got in a accountant, which was about 13 years ago, and I never thought I needed one before because I had a fairly simple situation.
[00:10:41] But since I started to become a 1099 employee.
[00:10:44] So even though I'm not a practicing REALTOR for our audience that probably knows that already, I am paid very similarly to how REALTORS are paid.
[00:10:52] So you can consider me a REALTOR for this conversation because, you know, I get, I have to pay the same sort of taxes that you guys do.
[00:10:59] And I'm tax the same way. But when I got an accountant, it really changed my outlook on taxes.
[00:11:05] It actually became something that I was a little bit excited to work on every year because I was able to save more.
[00:11:13] And of course, pay less and keep more in my pocket.
[00:11:18] So I'm really, really excited. We're going to do the state.
[00:11:20] It's sort of one of those topics that I think a lot of people could feel like, oh, it's not that exciting.
[00:11:25] But honestly, to save money to me is very exciting.
[00:11:28] So we'll talk about that. And also just to stay out of the crosshairs of the feds.
[00:11:34] None of us want to get those big letters from the IRS.
[00:11:38] And so having a good tax professional is really, I could not.
[00:11:42] You know, this is your business. Of course, talking not not to shahar, but to our audience.
[00:11:46] This is your business. Treat it like a business. Every business really has an accountant or they should.
[00:11:51] This is the same thing you should treat yourself to.
[00:11:54] So let's talk about that. So let's, I would first love to get us to get a talk.
[00:11:59] Well, let's talk about first saving for taxes because REALTORS are paid in lump sums.
[00:12:06] Their taxes are not taken out prior to getting paid.
[00:12:10] Right? So they are responsible ultimately for putting a certain amount of money aside.
[00:12:14] And I'm just curious if you have any best practices there such that I know when I have money in my bank account, I'll tend to spend it.
[00:12:23] So, you know, do you have any sort of suggestions for agents when the money's coming in sort of how to separate that out so that come this time of the year?
[00:12:33] You're not like, oh, my God. Now I have to write a $20,000 check that I didn't expect.
[00:12:36] So I think like everything in finances, it's all about planning.
[00:12:40] And I think that agents need to understand the doors, the great system around them.
[00:12:46] You know, when we speak about the tax world, we always say that the tax for this geared towards corporations.
[00:12:52] You know, when you have the umbrella of either corporate America or you're W2 employee, you're protected.
[00:12:59] You know, the employer is bringing a lot of awareness.
[00:13:01] They recommend you to do things. They put benefits and ideas of how to save money in front of you.
[00:13:09] None of that is existing in the world of our 1099 people.
[00:13:13] You know, there's no way for us to consume information from our corporation.
[00:13:18] We need to basically navigate that complexity on our own.
[00:13:22] And I think when it starts with financial education, it's about no system.
[00:13:31] When real estate agents start practicing, you know, I believe that most of them enjoying real estate.
[00:13:37] You know, this is why they get into the occupation.
[00:13:40] And they believe in themselves that they can actually perform the relationship with our customers.
[00:13:44] Because we know that real estate, it's a very intensive relationship industry.
[00:13:48] It's not about sales. It's about, you know, drive the relationship with your audience.
[00:13:52] So you have those transaction and the final, you know, in front of you, build with prospect
[00:13:58] and potential people that you can buy or sell their businesses.
[00:14:02] The same, you know, with every aspect of your business.
[00:14:05] We are all about, you know, people business and you mentioned about the relationship with your accountant.
[00:14:10] Pick your dream team. I think we speak about, you know, the dream team as something is super important.
[00:14:15] And sometimes we, you know, pick the dream team in the areas that we feel that have the most amount of impact.
[00:14:21] And we like to identify that actually accountants or people that move money for us.
[00:14:27] So deal with money for us.
[00:14:28] Has the ability not just to be just a cost saving, but the profit center.
[00:14:33] Because when I basically delegate stuff, you know, to my accountants and I can act based on information,
[00:14:40] based on numbers, based on insight, based on data, I can actually make better financial decisions.
[00:14:46] And I think what's important for us to make sure that real estate agents and what top producers are doing,
[00:14:55] they set goals. They make some strategic decision and it starts before the actually money comes into my account.
[00:15:03] It starts with my entity structure.
[00:15:05] You know, DJ, 90% of real estate agents still see it in a sole prop, you know, unincorporated structure in 2024.
[00:15:15] Why? You know, it's like a awareness. It's like of basically, you know, understanding that even just by moving into a single member of the C,
[00:15:23] you know, you're not changing your tax position, but at least you get the limited liability protection.
[00:15:29] You get the branding you pay, you get basically the credibility of me treating the business like a business.
[00:15:36] And then when I am already an LLC, then the move to, you know, a different tax-efficient structure like an escort, you know,
[00:15:45] it's a distance of a one form that you can fax to the IRS, you know, for them to accept your selection.
[00:15:50] So I think knowing your option, knowing your system, it's number one thing that we ask real estate agent to lean in, you know,
[00:16:00] the same as you learn, you know, how social media works for you and CRM system and how do you manage customers at the front of the house, you know,
[00:16:08] we ask real estate agent just to be a little bit more open for financial content.
[00:16:15] Yes, I agree with all of that. I would like to start with let's talk about the advantages of moving from a 1099 employee, a 1099 contract to either, you know,
[00:16:32] some sort of corporation. So I think, well, let's start there because as you said, 90% of agents are not taking advantage of the corporate tax structure.
[00:16:42] Why should they?
[00:16:44] Mainly because of the tax savings. So when you basically run a business in the US, you know, you're subject to three tier of tax mainly.
[00:16:53] Again, you have your state that you reside that will tax you either as a state tax, you know, or BNO tax or franchise tax board, but the franchise tax, but there is some relationship between you and the state.
[00:17:05] And then when you go to the federal level, there's some relationship with you between you and the IRS.
[00:17:10] But then us as a 1099 is a self employed, we're also exposed to an additional tax, self employment tax and the self employment tax in the US 15.3%.
[00:17:20] You're basically paying double, then your W2 friend, you know, because it's your W2 friend, you know, he pays half and the corporation is paying, you know, half US, the self employed are subject to both sides of self employment tax,
[00:17:34] 15.3% and this 15.3% usually comes as a surprise at the end of the year because you think about it.
[00:17:41] If I made just a hundred thousand dollar net at the end of the year, boom, I'm get surprised with about 15,000 dollar extra tax on top of my federal and state taxes.
[00:17:53] Escooperation pays zero because again, corporations are not even being, they're not paying so security in Medicare.
[00:18:00] So just the move, you know, to file my taxes as an escort and don't get me wrong.
[00:18:06] There are some requirements to run a healthy and compliant escort, but in general, just moving into an escoperation structure can save me 15% self employment taxes.
[00:18:17] And again, if we're talking about top producers that are making a hundred, 200, 300,000 dollar a year net profit just, you know, by addressing the self employment problem.
[00:18:29] I can save myself between 11 to 18,000 dollar a year, which mean we let real estate agents just sit and think about it.
[00:18:38] Imagine close your eyes. What could I do with another fifth with an additional 1500 bucks, you know, in my net to my overall financial being.
[00:18:49] How much more I can contribute, you know, and provide to my family.
[00:18:53] Yeah, I mean, you're right. You know, you're talking about, yeah, about 1500 a month or so in savings and, you know, at per 100,000 that you earn.
[00:19:02] So we're talking about or a little bit less than that, but essentially a huge amount of money here, you know, 11 to 18,000 per 100,000 that you earn.
[00:19:11] Even if you just took that money and threw it in a savings account or a money market right now, you might be getting five or six percent just on that.
[00:19:19] I would certainly much rather let that accrued interest and give the government that money for no good reason other than I just wasn't structured appropriately.
[00:19:28] So step one would be or incorporate would is a.
[00:19:31] So yeah, step number one, get yourself into the single member LLC because this is the entity that govern you on the state level.
[00:19:41] S corporation, it's a federal election. It's a relationship between between you and the IRS.
[00:19:48] So you continue to be an LLC, you know, for us instead of Washington, but then with the IRS, I asked the permission to tax me as an S corporation.
[00:19:57] Now you mentioned something super cool about hey, let's take this $15,000, you know, and put it in some saving account. Let's make more money.
[00:20:06] And I'm asking you let's put your $15,000 into a solo 401k, you know, because now I can save 30% on that.
[00:20:15] So now I take money that the government is basically paying me because I'm not overpaying on tax.
[00:20:21] And now I'm putting into my retirement account and we can speak the benefits of a 401k, step IRA, traditional, Roth, you know, each one of them has a role in the life of the real estate agent.
[00:20:31] But let's say that I'm using the most common retirement plan by corporate America, the 401k.
[00:20:38] If I put this $15,000 into my 401k, there is an additional 30% tax saving because now I defer this income, you know, to my age of retirement, called it 70, 72, which again, 30%, $15,000 and another $4,500.
[00:20:54] So 11, 15, $4,500. Again, you're talking about $20,000 a year tax savings between entity structure and retirement plan.
[00:21:04] And this is before we start optimizing your expenses. And I want to come back to the expenses maybe a little bit later because one of the things that we try to educate top producers, expenses is not a strategy.
[00:21:16] You know, when you expense that money never come back to you.
[00:21:21] But when you invest or when you basically save or when you use retirement mechanism, you actually use, it doesn't expense because the business can write off those items, but the money stays with you.
[00:21:34] The money stays with other people within your family. This is the pure, you know, increasing wealth, you know, for you as a business owner.
[00:21:43] Yes, all of that makes so much sense. I really like the idea of the retirement savings as well as as, you know, whether it's a Sapp IRA, a 401k, some sort of tax deferred retirement plan because this money will go in pre-tax.
[00:22:01] So, Shara said that. So what that means is, you know, you get paid on a commission, you take a certain percentage of that, throw that into your retirement plan.
[00:22:09] That money is not taxed until it's pulled out, you know, however many years later, this of course is a great retirement saving strategy. And when you pull it out, odds are you'll be at a lower tax bracket because you'll likely be in retirement at that time.
[00:22:21] And if you're still at the high tax, a hybrid tax bracket, well, then you're doing great, but at least you've deferred all of those taxes until, you know, until the end and all of that growth, of course, is wonderful.
[00:22:33] But that money doesn't get taxed right away. So that's a wonderful point. And you, you know, there's ways that you can access it with penalties before you retire, but really is is a great tax saving strategy for retirement and also just for current taxes.
[00:22:48] So you're absolutely right. The money that you'll save going from 1099 to incorporation is is something that you can use in a number of different ways. If you need the money for things you're saving for, then you can put it in, you know, in the market or you could put it in an iron, sorry, not an IRA, but attacks, attacks, taxable investment account, or you could put it in a pre-tax account, which would be an IRA or 401k, SAP as well.
[00:23:15] And so yeah, this is, this is, these are great, great ideas. And really we're talking about saving 15% of, you know, of this money that you would be giving the government if you weren't incorporated if you're just a 1099 contract employee.
[00:23:31] So huge opportunity there. Also want to talk about with respect to income. Do you have a suggestion for agents when they receive a commission check, you talk about planning, of course, being the most important thing. Do you encourage agents or 1099 employees or 1099 workers to have separate accounts in banks for when a income, when a check comes in, a certain percentage goes into my tax account.
[00:23:59] That'll be using to pay later or do you what sort of your thoughts on that.
[00:24:04] So by the way, you mentioned overpaying on taxes in 2022, by the way, based on the IRS information, self employed individual paid $220 billion in self employment tax.
[00:24:18] The move to an escort on most of them, you know, if you can again can send you 60% of it. So you're talking about gazillion amount of money, you know, that are bleeding basically what you call unmanaged into the system.
[00:24:32] So LLC first step because we want to separate our entities, you know, from me and my business. I want to buy, okay, the sugar from sugar LLC or sugar ink. I want to make sure there's separation of entities.
[00:24:47] And then yes, the natural next thing is to have a separate bank account. And the number one mistake that we see real estate agents are making is co-mingling of funds. And when you co-mingle of funds, there's two things that basically you diservice yourself or yourself.
[00:25:03] One, you cannot get visibility into the real numbers. So you're acting based on inaccurate data to make financial decision. You don't know, you know, if you're profitable, you don't know how much do you spend money on, you know, you don't know what is the real kind of a net profit.
[00:25:20] But if it even makes sense for me to stay in the industry, you know, because the other day we're making it because we create our own reality, but also we're making it to provide ourselves, you know, a decent living.
[00:25:34] So this is one second, it's the number one reason for the IRS to come and either revoke your selection or basically make some changes into your tax return.
[00:25:42] It's basically, you know, the IRS go after this co-mingling account and basically pull all of those transactions that are personal.
[00:25:53] And there's no reason, again, to take advantage as we mentioned a couple of minutes ago, you know, with expenses, because I can create a very efficient tax structure with the right escort, which is the thing, the retirement plan and some expense management.
[00:26:07] But it's all about habits. So the habit is, if I am running a business, let's make sure that all of my business expenses run through my business.
[00:26:15] And if I have some personal expenses, make sure that I'm taking, you know, all of those expenses on my personal side.
[00:26:22] And if there is something in the middle, yeah, go aggressive and deduct it through your business worst case at the end of the day when we do your bookkeeping and when we kind of manage your PNL or your expense spreadsheet will throw out some of those expenses.
[00:26:37] If we feel that, you know, a little bit too much for us, but managing your business expenses is should be certain. Forget it's not something that you need to pay attention every month.
[00:26:53] You said the charge of accounts once. So we said first step LLC second step, you know, business account, third step, cheap accounting software.
[00:27:04] You can buy zero today at seven bucks, you know, a month. You can basically go to herdler for ten bucks, you know, a month.
[00:27:11] You can find cheap online solutions that will bookkeeping for you, that will give you all of these expense classification automatically, directly from the bank account, it pull out the transaction, it clean it up, you know, such a life quality.
[00:27:27] If I don't need to do it manually or I don't need to wait until the end of the year to do it when I do it live and I have live information in front of me, I can make so much difference in my business.
[00:27:40] You said something that I hadn't really thought about with respect to mingling fun. So even if you have a business account and you are set up as a corporation, whether it's S Corp, C Corp, whatever it may be.
[00:27:54] I have all of my income to my business going into my business account, what I don't have and you just made me realize that this is something I need to do is I don't automatically take a percentage of of the income that comes into my business and put it in a separate account just to hold it there for taxes.
[00:28:12] And I have done this long enough to have a pretty good idea of what percentage that should be just to protect myself, but you're right.
[00:28:19] As a result, when I count up my income at the end of the year, I'm not taking the taxes out. So the numbers aren't really that accurate.
[00:28:26] I'm just seeing the blanket, you know, revenue that's coming into my business, but it's not really the right number as you were saying.
[00:28:33] So this idea of keeping things separate is so so important. Let's I want to talk about S Corp's because this is this is probably the most common type of structure that REALTORS find themselves doing once.
[00:28:48] And it's I know that S Corp's don't necessarily apply to every REALTOR based on how much income their business is producing, but it can make sense. I know for me, it made sense when I got to a certain income level in my business.
[00:29:00] And then it was a no brainer, but let's define because there's most of our audience probably doesn't understand the benefit of an of an S corporation. Actually, before we do that, I'm going to back up just one step.
[00:29:11] Let's first talk about the benefit of being an LLC before we we subcategorize into like S Corp C Corp. So let's talk about the benefit of it.
[00:29:22] You mentioned some of them, but I also the idea of a limited liability. Let's talk about what that means because REALTORS can be sued.
[00:29:30] And my understanding is there's protection built in to LLC structure that would make lawsuits a little bit more palatable or less scary if somebody comes after because they would come after the business correct versus the individual.
[00:29:49] Correct. And then what we usually recommend to those individuals that don't own or hold any assets within the LLC, you know, bring your commission, make sure that you have, you know, your expenses, maybe, you know, some some payroll liability, maybe some 401k liability, but there's no assets, which means if someone decide to go after you, you will find basically an empty shell, you know, LLC.
[00:30:12] There's no much assets, you can take the cash out and there's nothing to go after. But again, we're not building, you know, on the LLC to protect you, we want to make sure that you do things, you know, very ethically and also to make sure that you have the right insurance in place, which again, it's a business expense, those insurance as you mentioned.
[00:30:30] And then the tax allocation, DJ, if I need to ask you, you know, how much like if you're making two, three hundred thousand dollar a year, you know, if you're in your mind, how much would you set aside for tax? How much would you set aside? What is the percentage amount every check that you're set aside?
[00:30:47] So this is embarrassing because I don't do it and I don't really know, but if I had, I mean, this is embarrassing. I just do what my accountant tells me, which is also not.
[00:30:57] So if I had to guess, I would say 30%.
[00:30:59] Yeah, so again, so we are telling people don't put a dollar behind above 20. If someone is making about 250,000 dollar, your tax liability should not exceed, you know, 20%.
[00:31:14] And I think this is going back to your kind of the dollar amount, you know, the old equation was from every dollar amount, there's about 33% going to maintain business and 33% for tax and I maybe take all 33%.
[00:31:27] You know, each the formula in 2024 because of social media, because of digitalization, because the way that you can run a very efficient, you know, what you call business of one, you should not pay more than 20%, you know, in taxes.
[00:31:42] And you should not pay more than 20% of expenses to keep the lights on, which means in the new world of 2024, we see top agents taking 60% home.
[00:31:54] And when we think about, you know, profit first and profit first is kind of the envelope system, which is income minus my profit equal my expenses, it changed entirely mindset.
[00:32:05] Because if I put a goal that for every dollar coming to my business account, 50% is going into my side, is going to pay my taxes, which is my benefit, is going to fund my retirement, it's going to basically, you know, find my HSA, my health savings account, my FSA, my Flexible spending account for medical.
[00:32:25] And, you know, if I have kids, the 113, I can pay, you know, out of the business, $5,000 for my pre-after school expenses, it's to fund basically maybe my kids payroll, maybe my kids retirement.
[00:32:39] Again, there's so much things that I can keep money within the family.
[00:32:43] And then, you know, the 20% to keep the lights on, because we know it's almost like it's the toothpaste theory, you know, when we have more, we spend more, but when, you know, the toothbrush kind of, you know, the toothpaste is almost done, and we can squeeze, you know, another brush magical, you know, it's like a magic in the air, this is the same with business.
[00:33:03] You know, we see business owners, when they have more and the wealthy kind of, the wealth is coming their way, and the balance sheet become more kind of, you know, with cash and with some spending ability, we see people spend more money.
[00:33:22] And we want to let them know, no, continue to be disciplined about needs versus want, and you'll see that dramatically increase in your take home money.
[00:33:35] Yeah, I agree. I know I pay a lot less than 30%. Usually in the low 20s, maybe 20s is about where I'm at, because of the S corp structure, it is almost a bit magical.
[00:33:49] And something that will be very, very surprising in a good way, if you've never done it, you will find that boy, it is, it is a really nice structure.
[00:33:59] And so number one, you're limiting liability for in case anything someone decides that, you know, they thought you did something nefarious, they can go after it, but there's no assets held within the organization.
[00:34:10] So that of course protects or at least somewhat protects you. And then of course the tax benefits trickle down because my understanding is S corporations have a pass through, where in other words, can you explain what a pass through is.
[00:34:24] So in the corporate orders, two set of tax, you know, there's the C corp, the traditional tax corporate tax, it is double taxation, which means when I'm running a C corp, a traditional corporation, when the money comes in, I'm getting taxed, I'm paying, you know, corporate tax.
[00:34:43] And when I'm taking the money out in a salary or a dividend, I'm paying a second layer of taxation.
[00:34:50] LLC and S corporation are considerably a pass through entity, which we do is not corporate tax. When money comes in, you know, it's not getting taxed.
[00:35:01] When money get out, it's the first time that it's getting taxed and only on month federal rate. So S corporation has two classes of tax because they can take money out of the S corporation in two different ways.
[00:35:15] I'm taking money in the nature of wages, what to call reasonable compensation, because the IRS forces to take a reasonable compensation. So we'll pay some such security in Medicare, but it's definitely far beyond 100% of the bottom line or 100% of the net.
[00:35:30] This is why, you know, there's some margin of tax savings. And then what I'm not taking in the nature of a wage, I can take out in the nature of distributions.
[00:35:41] And those distributions are not subject to self-implum tax. So as an S corporation, again, the pass through element is only one layer of tax on your individual tax rate.
[00:35:54] There is no corporate tax on the S corporation level.
[00:35:58] And because in most cases, you will be the sole owner of the corporation. You ultimately, the entirety of the assets held within the organization are the businesses assets, but you are the sole owner.
[00:36:13] So ultimately, you know, we're all under kind of the same umbrella, but where really, really benefits agents is, as you said, the salary.
[00:36:22] So within an S corporation, I know that my accountant tells me every year, here's the salary, you are going to pay yourself. So, Shar says something very interesting. So that the IRS, you would think the IRS would have a very strict sort of algorithm or calculation to say, okay, you know, you DJ has enough, enough,
[00:36:41] as corporation, and your business makes, you know, X amount per year. So you're going to need to pay yourself, why? You know, there's, you would think there's a calculation, but there really isn't.
[00:36:51] There's just this idea of fair and equitable or what they fair and reasonable salary. It's really, and then I think they've tightened up the language a little bit in more recent years, but, because I know I used to pay myself a lot less of a salary, but I still pay myself much, much less as an employee.
[00:37:08] I am an employee, I'm the sole employee of my own corporation. This is how REALTORS do top REALTORS all do this. They become an employee of their of their corporation. They have to IRS says you have to pay yourself something fair and reasonable.
[00:37:20] So the accountant can work with you to say, okay, we think this percentage or, you know, this is the correct amount. This is, of course, you don't want to try to figure this out yourself. Definitely work with a tax professional.
[00:37:31] This is what they do. And, you know, and, and then what you'll find is your salary is probably much less than it would be if you were just a 1099 where you're paying taxes on all of it.
[00:37:43] So this is a huge, huge benefit. If I were to show you, and if I were to show you what I pay myself every year, you would be like, wow, DJ's not doing very well, but I'm actually doing quite well because my corporation holds the majority of those assets or assets.
[00:38:01] That's being just the income. And I pay myself all I only pay myself with the IRS tells me I need to and I use my account to figure out what that amount is.
[00:38:11] And I think this is something you to mention. Again, we're talking about common mistakes. You know, not knowing escort is a thing, one big mistake. Everybody should at least consider escort and for most.
[00:38:27] And 1099 real estate agents again, if you're making more than $80,000 a year, as corporation will pay, you know, big time. Second is the payroll concept, you know, because it's pretty odd, you know, being sole prop for the rest of my life.
[00:38:41] I never took payroll. I just took money out of the cookie jar. Now I need to be a little bit more disciplined, you know, I need to run the payroll and it runs distributions.
[00:38:48] People believe that I think the payroll is a chore or payroll is something bad. And they don't understand that actually payroll is your enabler.
[00:38:57] Payroll is the one that if you take it reasonably and you're not abuse the system, it allow you to not pay self employment taxes or your distributions, you know, because you actually prove the concept that, you know, how to use the W2 payroll concept.
[00:39:12] But second, paying self employment taxes or security Medicare, FICA is the enabler for banking, is the enabler for lending, is the enabler for retirement planning, is the enabler for so many great corporate level benefits.
[00:39:27] So part of the formations education system is we try to educate and break the status quo around payroll. And letting people know that payroll is actually a great thing for them to consider.
[00:39:41] Again, on the S-cooperation world, it's a must, but the reasonable compensation, how much money do you take, you know, as part of the payroll should basically be tailored for your needs for that financial year.
[00:39:57] Because if I don't need the payroll, I may go all the way to the floor, to the reasonable compensation allowed by the study that we're doing and will perform a study to make sure that those numbers can be dependent in case the IRS is asking.
[00:40:11] But think about it, there are years that actually I want to inflate it, my payroll, because I want to over-contribute into my retirement.
[00:40:17] Or basically I need my W2 for lending, because I know that many of our real estate agents, listener, savings, the retirement with rental properties.
[00:40:28] How do I buy a rental property, you know, how do I get a loan or mortgage without my financials, almost impossible.
[00:40:35] So what we want to do with an S-cooperation is not just to take advantage of all of the benefits, but to position the S-coorp in such an healthy way that you will be a banking sweetheart.
[00:40:47] That everywhere you go, people will want to lend you money because your financials will show that you're super strong and healthy.
[00:40:54] So, Shahar is bringing up a really good point, so I think this is an important topic.
[00:40:59] So I will tell you where people tend to get a little nervous is around refinancing a mortgage or purchasing a property when they have an S-cooperation status, meaning they have a company that they own a corporation and they pay themselves a fair and reasonable salary, which is going to be significantly less than if you were, because you're a W2 employee of your own company.
[00:41:24] But let's say you were working for a large corporation, not your own company, and you're going to be saving a lot more in those taxes.
[00:41:32] But what happens when you go to apply for a loan is when you show your own personal tax returns, it's going to paint a picture that might seem that, well, he just doesn't earn a lot of money.
[00:41:45] However, because this has happened to me a number of times whenever I've bought or refinanced, all I ever have to do is provide all the financials for my corporation and lenders understand this.
[00:41:57] It's not a scary thing. They go, okay, we get it. You really own this company and yes, you pay yourself a smaller salary. It has never been a problem for me.
[00:42:06] If I only showed my W2, it might be a problem, but because I own the company, I can show that and it does not create a problem around refinancing or getting a loan.
[00:42:17] You're absolutely right. In fact, it is something that as soon as they see that there's a corporation in S-Corp and they see the financials of the S-Corp not a problem, or at least has it been a problem in my experience.
[00:42:29] I have a question for you. This is something that I don't fully understand. I'm excited to, I don't know if there's a clear answer here, but I'd love to get your thoughts.
[00:42:38] Here's where I, every year around tax time, I always wonder what I'm supposed to do for this. I should just ask by accountant.
[00:42:46] My corporation, is it better for my, so I pay for individual health insurance. Very common for people who are real estate agents.
[00:42:56] If you don't have a spouse that maybe has a group insurance plan, you're probably paying individual on your own.
[00:43:02] Should me as the individual pay that, those premiums, or should the corporation pay those premiums for me, the employee? Curious to get your thoughts on that.
[00:43:13] So, regardless, how do you pay it? It will be a business deduction. So, your health insurance or self-employment health insurance will be a business expense.
[00:43:23] Sometimes it just depends on how do you basically engage with either the exchange or how do you engage with a third party or a group.
[00:43:33] You know, health insurance, because I know that some real estate agents are using associations or using sometimes like a mini-PO, like a professional employer organization,
[00:43:43] they're joining some solutions that they can run their payroll under a third party and therefore get corporate level benefits.
[00:43:50] So, it depends on this level of engagement. Regardless, we prefer that the business would pay all of your expenses, including all of your health insurance expense.
[00:44:01] But I think you mentioned something earlier, even if you're not as disciplined and you pay some of your expenses privately or in personal court, make sure that you have this cadence or discipline that every two weeks or a month, the business is reimbursing you for those expenses.
[00:44:18] So, now they become part of your business expense.
[00:44:20] But again, health insurance, your issue, we know, we are aware. By doing formations has three plans that we're offering specifically for real estate agents.
[00:44:31] It took us a while to find the right provider. But if you go to the formation website under benefits, you can see and start doing some calculations about health insurance coverage.
[00:44:42] And in many times it's a bit actually the coverage and the cost you can find out there. But regardless what you find as the health insurance, make sure that you run it through the business.
[00:44:54] And you also, again, health insurance is one of those real things that you need to include it actually in your W2.
[00:45:01] So, as an S corporation owner, you need to include your health insurance in the W2 and then you can deduct it under adjustment to income.
[00:45:08] So, overall, you get the deduction. But again, one mistake that people basically are doing, they're not including their health insurance cost on the business.
[00:45:18] And by mistake, they put it under medical expenses on schedule A on your ITEMAS deduction, you know, and it doesn't give them any benefit.
[00:45:26] So, again, regardless how do you pay for your health insurance, make sure that the business is expensive.
[00:45:32] And, you know, there's some really interesting expenses that S corporations can benefit from that I believe are unique to corporate structured entities, which for example, I have a monthly meeting that I hold at my condo for the business.
[00:45:54] I am the sole owner and sole shareholder of the business, but I am allowed to have, I believe monthly meetings and I believe even to events a year, I think as well.
[00:46:06] So, there are some really neat ways that you can increase your deductions by having, by taking advantage, and this is not exploitative, this is actually what the tax code allows for.
[00:46:18] And big corporations do this all the time. They of course take advantage of every opportunity to save on taxes that is applicable and ethical.
[00:46:28] And we want all of you to do the same thing. So, there's a lot of cool stuff that you will find out, but you need to have a tax professional that really is able to say, hey, you know, you're a shareholder in your company, did you know you can have shareholder meetings, this regular, and you can expense what the expenses might be for those meetings.
[00:46:45] So, there's some really, really cool stuff you can do. Also, same thing with transportation. I know there are some, I don't think it makes sense in my situation because I've asked, but maybe I'm wrong, is that there are times when your car expense, whether you're leasing a car, whether you've purchased a car and making payments, that can also be, it might make sense to hold that in the corporation's name or it might make sense to hold that individually and have the corporation help with the payments or, you know, I'm just, I'm not, I don't know.
[00:47:15] I don't know the exact structure, but there are a lot of opportunities. These are the questions that you bring to Shahar and his team and say, hey, I'm thinking about getting a car. Should I, should I lease, should I buy? These are, these are what we need help for because I'm actually in the process now, or I have a car that's been paid off forever. I don't really want to buy a new car, but I probably need to.
[00:47:34] And I'm like, okay, what's the best way to structure it? I don't want to figure that out. I don't know how to figure that out. I'm going to reach out to my accountant or Shahar and his team and say, hey, what's the best structure here? Does it make sense to lease? And I know there are situations where it can. And I just, you know, I don't know the answers to that. But these are the things you bring, of course, to your professional.
[00:47:57] So business use of auto is a huge topic. And today in the EV world, in the electric world, you know, it's even bigger topic just because of the incentives of electric cars. For real estate agents, you know, there's always the benefit of a car, which is a 6,000 pounds and over, you know, then you can get kind of truck, both of the appreciation treatment.
[00:48:21] When you mention about, you know, lease versus buy, usually it's an exotetax discussion, usually it's a cash flow discussion, it's a financial discussion. But again, if you know your numbers, if you know your cash flow, if you know how much money you should keep in the business, how much money you can get out, you know, you can make those discussion with yourself about what can I afford?
[00:48:43] Regarding to business use of auto, again, the mileage rate is 10 out of 10 times better, you know, unless it's kind of 2020, pandemic, when everybody is doing kind of the showing remote and they're not driving when people drive, usually the tax rate to deduct your mileage is way beneficial.
[00:49:05] Then, you know, my actual, because most of us, again, even if you drive an older car, the cost to maintenance today, most of our cars relatively low, which means I can take advantage by the fact that I don't have the actual expense and the IRS is giving me almost like a per-dem, you know, like a flat rate per mileage.
[00:49:25] So if I'm driving, you know, 20,000 miles a year, I can get, you know, close to 12, 13, 14,000 dollar of tax deduction, usually I don't have such a cost to maintain, again, repairs, gas, insurance, etc.
[00:49:42] So, know your options.
[00:49:44] DJ, what extra deduction that we love to speak about is also the business use of home. You know, ask real estate agents, when we wake up in the morning, first thing that we do, we walk into our home office, start checking, mails, what happened overnight, some research, what come available, you know, in the morning on MLS or whatever, you know, what's my pipeline going to look like, this is, you know, a real office.
[00:50:08] Let's deduct some of your home office expenses. And now when I'm actually traveling between, you know, my home office into my business office, into my brokerage, it's not a community, it's actually a business expense.
[00:50:21] So I'm gaining twice the benefit. And, you know, in general, what we just want to make sure the real estate agents understand is that the same is your curious and aggressive and a hassle, you know, at the top and at the front of the house, we want you to behave the same.
[00:50:38] You know, we want you to focus on your home, with your back office, because sometimes when people got into their back office, they're a little bit afraid of the system, they're insecure. You know, we know that there's this five and formal, the fear uncertainty and doubt of taking advantage of the system or the formal missing out on some expenses.
[00:50:56] Again, if you pick the right dream team, the right people around you, if you're curious enough to do a lot of learning. And by the way, we're telling the agent, they need to do also learning because they're coming from such a biased relationship.
[00:51:11] My accountant told me, no, no, no, no, no, how come you guys saying yes, yes, yes, yes, because your accountant sometimes is running in a gender that has the conflict between him and you and you need to find the partner that actually working for you and with you.
[00:51:27] And when you find those amazing people that will working with you as a partner, you will get a world of enablement of more things that you can actually achieve or your financial system.
[00:51:39] And also maybe realizing that there's things you're doing that put you at risk for audits and additional payments. And so having this tax professional on board and not just having one tax professional, I already have an account, I like her, she seems to be good.
[00:51:59] But here's what I don't do every couple of years, I should let someone else take a look and say, how does this, how does this look, you know, you audit, you know, yourself, you audit, you know, other things in your life, you should audit your your accountant.
[00:52:12] And the best way to do that is let, let formations, guys, I'm going to do this and the thought of even breaking up with my accountant is a tough one for me because I really enjoy them, but business is business and there's no harm in having someone else take a look.
[00:52:26] And you know what, I've actually had this done in the past and the other times people have looked at it in the last 13 years, I've had it maybe two or three times, I've had other accountants look at it, they go, you're actually pretty good, I would stay with the person.
[00:52:37] So, you know, but even if you're just getting confirmation that you have a great person, it's worth getting a second opinion, just like you would for any sort of major surgery, any sort of, you know, other health issue, your attorney issue, you know, you're probably going to see a couple attorneys before you make any big moves.
[00:52:54] Formations corp.com is the place to go. You can literally, I am going to do this, even though I love my account and I'm terrified of breaking up with her because I really like her, but I need to think about my business is best financial interest.
[00:53:07] And, you know, maybe she's not as up to date on the more recent, you know, sort of different changes in the tax code.
[00:53:15] So, I'm going to send my stuff over to Shahar and his team. In fact, you can, you can check me on it if you want to know if I really did it, reach out to me and I will let you know what happened, but I promise that that's what I'm going to do, because now I am scared, there's things I'm not doing.
[00:53:30] In fact, I know there's things I'm not doing correctly. So, I am excited to have Shahar and his team take a look at my corporate structure, see what I'm doing that maybe could be done better, maybe there's a tax savings, or maybe it's just, hey DJ, you're doing this thing and it's kind of risky.
[00:53:43] We don't want you to, we don't want to see you getting audited. I've never been audited. Thank goodness. I don't want to be audited. I certainly just don't want to go through that process. So, guys, even if you have a great accountant, even if you have a great account, reach out to formationscorp.com and reach out to Shahar and his team. His team, and this is what they do.
[00:54:02] They get, you can hear the excitement and passion in his voice. By the way, you know, somebody that gets excited about taxes is a unique individual. So, these are the people you want on your team. You want your, you know, your doctors to care about you, you want your attorney to care about you, you should also want your account to feel the same way.
[00:54:18] And guess what, every year around this time, I, all of a sudden go, oh my god, what do I get to expense? I never know.
[00:54:25] So, Shahar and his team are going to help you figure that out. They are going to give you guides and things that you can start tracking from here until, you know, until tax season. And of course, all throughout the year to help you do that as well.
[00:54:37] Okay, formationscorp.com is where to go. Shahar, I wanted to ask one other question related to taxes is any, any other, by the way, top agents are doing the so Shahar said something very important. I just want to reiterate, he said basically when you get to the $80,000 income level with your business or the income coming in, whether you're a 1099 or not.
[00:55:04] This is when you probably make sense to consider it being incorporated. So, you know, if you're at that level, even if you're not at that level, reach out to your accountant and find out if it makes sense. I know for me it took a couple of years when I first started in this business.
[00:55:19] My accountant said, you're good for now when you get to this level and it was right at that $80,000 level. And that's when he said, okay, now we're incorporating and it just completely changed my mind.
[00:55:27] I wanted us to just give ask a question about one other topic, which is talking about cash. So when cash comes in, we talk about different things we can do with it. We can put it in for we can save a pre tax dollars, put it into retirement savings.
[00:55:43] We can put we can put it in a taxable accounts for money markets, you know, taxable retirement taxable investment accounts. We can also consider investing in what we would call syndication deals, real estate deals that that are very interesting.
[00:56:02] And I didn't know about rescind, what we would call syndication deals until the last several years where I had extra cash. I needed it. I didn't want to save it. It wasn't going to be used for retirement, but it was going to be used for future goals that I have down the road.
[00:56:18] And my partner in business said, let's take some of that money and invest in these in like a commercial, a commercial a strip center, for example. So there are companies that run, you know, their property management companies or they own the they also own the land.
[00:56:35] And they rent it out to, you know, whoever, and you have to do your due diligence, of course, but basically the main benefit to me, even though I do get some sort of monthly amount they send me, I get all my money back, hopefully in a few years.
[00:56:49] But most importantly, is this a tax savings because I get what's called a K one at the end of the year. Can I talk just briefly about the brilliance of K ones and what they do to someone's taxes.
[00:57:00] So by the way, K one is what you get also for more escort. This is kind of the form. There's a past rent that is so when you go and syndicate, you know, with someone else, we see, you know, multi-family homes.
[00:57:12] We see more centers, we see some commercial development. And again, what we usually what those syndication are doing, they are leveraging your money, they are taking your money as part of the equity.
[00:57:24] And then they borrow money against it to again for a model of our improvements. The K one that comes back, you know, usually come negative.
[00:57:35] It's come usually when, let's say, put $50,000. So the first $50,000 that I get back will be my return of my investment. It won't be taxable.
[00:57:44] But what usually happens is that those syndication, those big LLCs have net operating losses as they're managing their syndication.
[00:57:53] And because you're a partial owner of that project, you're entitled to get percentage of those losses. So what we see, we see those K one coming negative.
[00:58:03] And because it's a passive income, you know, because, you know, it's it's it's not your core main of business. But because it's real estate, you can offset it against your actually commission income.
[00:58:15] So when we see, you know, people have the appetite for syndication, we encourage them kind of to time this indication the investment such that will every year, we'll have couple of K ones coming back as a negative and that negative income.
[00:58:32] And again, doesn't mean that negative income, it's negative cash flow. It's just book value. How do you use depreciation and loans and and debt basically to allocate to the to the different owners.
[00:58:45] But when that came K one coming back reported on schedule e page two and don't be confused with schedule e page one, which was your rental properties.
[00:58:55] If you have rental properties and K one and commission income, you know, you can actually do something super interesting, what's called tax harvesting.
[00:59:04] You can offset gains and losses and make a really really effective lower effective tax rate.
[00:59:11] Absolutely. So yeah, I get I get I think I get five K ones a year and they are all negative, which I love and that the negative number goes against some of my earnings in other parts of the business or or that's probably not the right way to say it.
[00:59:26] But it basically overall subtracts from my overall income. And that means less taxes guys.
[00:59:33] It's a structure taxable income. It's obviously your taxable income in the end, which means there is basically a both element to get you to a lower tax bracket sometimes.
[00:59:45] So you gain, you know, lower tax bracket to tax your overall contribution, but it's overall tax needs, but it's also offset real income one to one.
[00:59:56] And real estate agents has the benefit that most of them are what called real estate professionals in the eyes of the IRS, they're participating in real estate so much that the IRS allowed them, you know, to take those passive activities and take them against ordinary income, you know, one of the privileges that only real estate agents has due to the fact that such a big lobby, you know, in Washington DC.
[01:00:22] Well, that's true, that's true. That's I believe it's the biggest lobby of all industries is the real estate lobby. I don't know that that's that's true with the capital T, but I've heard that.
[01:00:32] So either way, it's a very powerful lobby and yes, there are benefits to being classified as a real estate professional with the IRS.
[01:00:40] So in fact, I do not believe I am classified that way. So I need to talk to you to see if that would be appropriate for my situation. So I'm going to chat with Shahar offline.
[01:00:51] And I'm also just going to send him all of my information to see number one, how is my account doing and a PC's opportunities, you know, there, there we go. And I'm going to reach reach out and possibly switch switch providers.
[01:01:04] So formations corp is where you go to learn all things Shahar and his team. This is what they do. They focus specifically on 1099 employees. Again, I'm not a 1099 employee anymore.
[01:01:16] But they also of course specialize in the solutions to maybe considering moving beyond 1099 and you all will be, you know, this is a business. You want to run it like a business and you don't want to the time for just doing turbo tax.
[01:01:31] It is probably not the right call for a for a real estate agent. It's just probably not the right call depending on your income. Again, talk to your professional. This is not of course tax advice in any way.
[01:01:44] But it is something that you should reach out to your tax professional to get that advice. So reach out to Shahar and his team formations corp.com. I also want to mention that they have social media. And you think, well, does an account need social media? Yeah, of course.
[01:01:59] Because they're able to give really great information in bite size format. They have several different accounts. They're all over Instagram, Facebook linked in really everywhere. We will have links to that.

Let me tell you more about Shahar. Now, Shahar Plinner is an entrepreneur and a tax expert on a mission to disrupt the status quo for real estate agents. 18 years ago, Shahar moved from Israel to Seattle and founded, scaled and sold a leading tax and accounting firm with the presence in Seattle, Silicon Valley and Tel Aviv.

Shahar continues to champion the cause. Formations is a tax management solution for the self employed and powers real estate agents to save thousands on taxes annually, make better financial decision and democratizes access to corporate level benefits such as quality and affordable healthcare as well as easy to implement retirement solutions. I want everybody, everybody, even if you have an account to go visit Formations Corp.com. Guess what? I have an accountant. I'm going to check it out because even if you do have an accountant, you may not have the perfect account for your situation. So go to FormationsCorp.com and learn more Shahar. Welcome to the show. Hey, DJ, thank you so much for having me. It's a pleasure. Well, this is, this is really embarrassing because I'll pull back the curtain on the show. So oftentimes I get to the episode just a few minutes before we're recording and my team puts all the notes together. So soon as we got on, I was chatting with Shahar before we started and I said, boy, that sounds like an Israeli accent. And then I asked him, I go, was, you know, is that Israeli? He said, oh, yeah, yeah, it is. And then sure enough, it's right there in the bio that I was going to read two minutes later. So Charles, like, well, this guy does no preparation for the show. So I apologize. Again, it's behind the scenes thing. But anyway, super excited to have you because right now it's towards the end of February, 2024. We are right coming up on tax season. It's already tax season. And this is the time for REALTORS to start thinking about their expenses. And of course, all the money they're either going to get back or they have to pay in to Uncle Sam. So really excited to have you. I think this may be the first time in 550 episodes we've ever had a tax guru on specifically for REALTORS. So really appreciate you being here. And let's get started with, you know, how did you, you've been in taxes for quite some time? How did you get into taxes? What, what was your path there? My path was, how can I be as far away as possible from my family owned business? You know, as someone in the corrupt, in a family owned business, only, you know, someone that's been there can understand, you know, the dynamic of being, you know, working for your dad, your mom, your brother, your sister, and have all of these co-mingering of emotions, you know, between, you know, how do I separate my dad, my parents from, you know, working. It's impossible. So me is the youngest, basically, a family of three boys and I'm the youngest. I rebel and basically, you know, made a decision that I'm no longer part of the family owned business. And I look for something in finance, something in numbers. And I don't know, it was, you know, it was, I couldn't explain how basically I came, you know, into the tax world. But basically, you know, I got an introduction to a person that basically showed me the tax world, the US tax world. And I find it amazing, you know, it's a whole world of opportunities and possibilities. And I think me as a service provider in nature put myself kind of the mission to be the extension or basic to be the liaison between the systems. You know, that speaks sometimes such a complicated language. And me as, you know, English my second language, I'm speaking Hebrew fluent. I had to basically use my whole English vocabulary, you know, to democratize. A tax code to the audience and it worked. It kept it super simple, super engaged. And being in taxes, you always feel that you're kind of robbing hood, you know, you're the good side of the government allowing people the access to the knowledge and basically to show them what is really possible. And what we're telling people about taxes, you know, and I love your kind of keep it real. It's real, you know, the savings and the things that you can actually enjoy from the system is real translate in more money in your pocket. So I love, you know, the concept of taxes, I see taxes, you know, I come really, you know, unfortunate to see something complicated that most people are really struggling with. And then when I start my journey, I just, you know, I felt I'm in my soul, I'm with my people, you know, and this was kind of the foundation of, you know, my journey in taxes. And if I can stay in taxes for the rest of my life, you know, this is what I want to do. Well, we're going to be paying taxes for the rest of our lives. So it makes sense. It's one of those, you know, those jobs that when, and also it's one of those jobs that, you know, it's like a dentist. They're just always going to be needed until maybe there's robots to do everything else. But until that time, and even even, and really quite frankly, there are robots right now that's to do taxes. We've had, you know, automated tax software, tax software solutions for gosh, probably 20 plus years more than that. I'm sure, but the a good accountant can see through a lot of what the algorithmic, you know, software solutions can't. And so I know too that when I got in a accountant, which was about 13 years ago, and I never thought I needed one before because I had a fairly simple situation. But since I started to become a 1099 employee. So even though I'm not a practicing REALTOR for our audience that probably knows that already, I am paid very similarly to how REALTORS are paid. So you can consider me a REALTOR for this conversation because, you know, I get, I have to pay the same sort of taxes that you guys do. And I'm tax the same way. But when I got an accountant, it really changed my outlook on taxes. It actually became something that I was a little bit excited to work on every year because I was able to save more. And of course, pay less and keep more in my pocket. So I'm really, really excited. We're going to do the state. It's sort of one of those topics that I think a lot of people could feel like, oh, it's not that exciting. But honestly, to save money to me is very exciting. So we'll talk about that. And also just to stay out of the crosshairs of the feds. None of us want to get those big letters from the IRS. And so having a good tax professional is really, I could not. You know, this is your business. Of course, talking not not to shahar, but to our audience. This is your business. Treat it like a business. Every business really has an accountant or they should. This is the same thing you should treat yourself to. So let's talk about that. So let's, I would first love to get us to get a talk. Well, let's talk about first saving for taxes because REALTORS are paid in lump sums. Their taxes are not taken out prior to getting paid. Right? So they are responsible ultimately for putting a certain amount of money aside. And I'm just curious if you have any best practices there such that I know when I have money in my bank account, I'll tend to spend it. So, you know, do you have any sort of suggestions for agents when the money's coming in sort of how to separate that out so that come this time of the year? You're not like, oh, my God. Now I have to write a $20,000 check that I didn't expect. So I think like everything in finances, it's all about planning. And I think that agents need to understand the doors, the great system around them. You know, when we speak about the tax world, we always say that the tax for this geared towards corporations. You know, when you have the umbrella of either corporate America or you're W2 employee, you're protected. You know, the employer is bringing a lot of awareness. They recommend you to do things. They put benefits and ideas of how to save money in front of you. None of that is existing in the world of our 1099 people. You know, there's no way for us to consume information from our corporation. We need to basically navigate that complexity on our own. And I think when it starts with financial education, it's about no system. When real estate agents start practicing, you know, I believe that most of them enjoying real estate. You know, this is why they get into the occupation. And they believe in themselves that they can actually perform the relationship with our customers. Because we know that real estate, it's a very intensive relationship industry. It's not about sales. It's about, you know, drive the relationship with your audience. So you have those transaction and the final, you know, in front of you, build with prospect and potential people that you can buy or sell their businesses. The same, you know, with every aspect of your business. We are all about, you know, people business and you mentioned about the relationship with your accountant. Pick your dream team. I think we speak about, you know, the dream team as something is super important. And sometimes we, you know, pick the dream team in the areas that we feel that have the most amount of impact. And we like to identify that actually accountants or people that move money for us. So deal with money for us. Has the ability not just to be just a cost saving, but the profit center. Because when I basically delegate stuff, you know, to my accountants and I can act based on information, based on numbers, based on insight, based on data, I can actually make better financial decisions. And I think what's important for us to make sure that real estate agents and what top producers are doing, they set goals. They make some strategic decision and it starts before the actually money comes into my account. It starts with my entity structure. You know, DJ, 90% of real estate agents still see it in a sole prop, you know, unincorporated structure in 2024. Why? You know, it's like a awareness. It's like of basically, you know, understanding that even just by moving into a single member of the C, you know, you're not changing your tax position, but at least you get the limited liability protection. You get the branding you pay, you get basically the credibility of me treating the business like a business. And then when I am already an LLC, then the move to, you know, a different tax-efficient structure like an escort, you know, it's a distance of a one form that you can fax to the IRS, you know, for them to accept your selection. So I think knowing your option, knowing your system, it's number one thing that we ask real estate agent to lean in, you know, the same as you learn, you know, how social media works for you and CRM system and how do you manage customers at the front of the house, you know, we ask real estate agent just to be a little bit more open for financial content. Yes, I agree with all of that. I would like to start with let's talk about the advantages of moving from a 1099 employee, a 1099 contract to either, you know, some sort of corporation. So I think, well, let's start there because as you said, 90% of agents are not taking advantage of the corporate tax structure. Why should they? Mainly because of the tax savings. So when you basically run a business in the US, you know, you're subject to three tier of tax mainly. Again, you have your state that you reside that will tax you either as a state tax, you know, or BNO tax or franchise tax board, but the franchise tax, but there is some relationship between you and the state. And then when you go to the federal level, there's some relationship with you between you and the IRS. But then us as a 1099 is a self employed, we're also exposed to an additional tax, self employment tax and the self employment tax in the US 15.3%. You're basically paying double, then your W2 friend, you know, because it's your W2 friend, you know, he pays half and the corporation is paying, you know, half US, the self employed are subject to both sides of self employment tax, 15.3% and this 15.3% usually comes as a surprise at the end of the year because you think about it. If I made just a hundred thousand dollar net at the end of the year, boom, I'm get surprised with about 15,000 dollar extra tax on top of my federal and state taxes. Escooperation pays zero because again, corporations are not even being, they're not paying so security in Medicare. So just the move, you know, to file my taxes as an escort and don't get me wrong. There are some requirements to run a healthy and compliant escort, but in general, just moving into an escoperation structure can save me 15% self employment taxes. And again, if we're talking about top producers that are making a hundred, 200, 300,000 dollar a year net profit just, you know, by addressing the self employment problem. I can save myself between 11 to 18,000 dollar a year, which mean we let real estate agents just sit and think about it. Imagine close your eyes. What could I do with another fifth with an additional 1500 bucks, you know, in my net to my overall financial being. How much more I can contribute, you know, and provide to my family. Yeah, I mean, you're right. You know, you're talking about, yeah, about 1500 a month or so in savings and, you know, at per 100,000 that you earn. So we're talking about or a little bit less than that, but essentially a huge amount of money here, you know, 11 to 18,000 per 100,000 that you earn. Even if you just took that money and threw it in a savings account or a money market right now, you might be getting five or six percent just on that. I would certainly much rather let that accrued interest and give the government that money for no good reason other than I just wasn't structured appropriately. So step one would be or incorporate would is a. So yeah, step number one, get yourself into the single member LLC because this is the entity that govern you on the state level. S corporation, it's a federal election. It's a relationship between between you and the IRS. So you continue to be an LLC, you know, for us instead of Washington, but then with the IRS, I asked the permission to tax me as an S corporation. Now you mentioned something super cool about hey, let's take this $15,000, you know, and put it in some saving account. Let's make more money. And I'm asking you let's put your $15,000 into a solo 401k, you know, because now I can save 30% on that. So now I take money that the government is basically paying me because I'm not overpaying on tax. And now I'm putting into my retirement account and we can speak the benefits of a 401k, step IRA, traditional, Roth, you know, each one of them has a role in the life of the real estate agent. But let's say that I'm using the most common retirement plan by corporate America, the 401k. If I put this $15,000 into my 401k, there is an additional 30% tax saving because now I defer this income, you know, to my age of retirement, called it 70, 72, which again, 30%, $15,000 and another $4,500. So 11, 15, $4,500. Again, you're talking about $20,000 a year tax savings between entity structure and retirement plan. And this is before we start optimizing your expenses. And I want to come back to the expenses maybe a little bit later because one of the things that we try to educate top producers, expenses is not a strategy. You know, when you expense that money never come back to you. But when you invest or when you basically save or when you use retirement mechanism, you actually use, it doesn't expense because the business can write off those items, but the money stays with you. The money stays with other people within your family. This is the pure, you know, increasing wealth, you know, for you as a business owner. Yes, all of that makes so much sense. I really like the idea of the retirement savings as well as as, you know, whether it's a Sapp IRA, a 401k, some sort of tax deferred retirement plan because this money will go in pre-tax. So, Shara said that. So what that means is, you know, you get paid on a commission, you take a certain percentage of that, throw that into your retirement plan. That money is not taxed until it's pulled out, you know, however many years later, this of course is a great retirement saving strategy. And when you pull it out, odds are you'll be at a lower tax bracket because you'll likely be in retirement at that time. And if you're still at the high tax, a hybrid tax bracket, well, then you're doing great, but at least you've deferred all of those taxes until, you know, until the end and all of that growth, of course, is wonderful. But that money doesn't get taxed right away. So that's a wonderful point. And you, you know, there's ways that you can access it with penalties before you retire, but really is is a great tax saving strategy for retirement and also just for current taxes. So you're absolutely right. The money that you'll save going from 1099 to incorporation is is something that you can use in a number of different ways. If you need the money for things you're saving for, then you can put it in, you know, in the market or you could put it in an iron, sorry, not an IRA, but attacks, attacks, taxable investment account, or you could put it in a pre-tax account, which would be an IRA or 401k, SAP as well. And so yeah, this is, this is, these are great, great ideas. And really we're talking about saving 15% of, you know, of this money that you would be giving the government if you weren't incorporated if you're just a 1099 contract employee. So huge opportunity there. Also want to talk about with respect to income. Do you have a suggestion for agents when they receive a commission check, you talk about planning, of course, being the most important thing. Do you encourage agents or 1099 employees or 1099 workers to have separate accounts in banks for when a income, when a check comes in, a certain percentage goes into my tax account. That'll be using to pay later or do you what sort of your thoughts on that. So by the way, you mentioned overpaying on taxes in 2022, by the way, based on the IRS information, self employed individual paid $220 billion in self employment tax. The move to an escort on most of them, you know, if you can again can send you 60% of it. So you're talking about gazillion amount of money, you know, that are bleeding basically what you call unmanaged into the system. So LLC first step because we want to separate our entities, you know, from me and my business. I want to buy, okay, the sugar from sugar LLC or sugar ink. I want to make sure there's separation of entities. And then yes, the natural next thing is to have a separate bank account. And the number one mistake that we see real estate agents are making is co-mingling of funds. And when you co-mingle of funds, there's two things that basically you diservice yourself or yourself. One, you cannot get visibility into the real numbers. So you're acting based on inaccurate data to make financial decision. You don't know, you know, if you're profitable, you don't know how much do you spend money on, you know, you don't know what is the real kind of a net profit. But if it even makes sense for me to stay in the industry, you know, because the other day we're making it because we create our own reality, but also we're making it to provide ourselves, you know, a decent living. So this is one second, it's the number one reason for the IRS to come and either revoke your selection or basically make some changes into your tax return. It's basically, you know, the IRS go after this co-mingling account and basically pull all of those transactions that are personal. And there's no reason, again, to take advantage as we mentioned a couple of minutes ago, you know, with expenses, because I can create a very efficient tax structure with the right escort, which is the thing, the retirement plan and some expense management. But it's all about habits. So the habit is, if I am running a business, let's make sure that all of my business expenses run through my business. And if I have some personal expenses, make sure that I'm taking, you know, all of those expenses on my personal side. And if there is something in the middle, yeah, go aggressive and deduct it through your business worst case at the end of the day when we do your bookkeeping and when we kind of manage your PNL or your expense spreadsheet will throw out some of those expenses. If we feel that, you know, a little bit too much for us, but managing your business expenses is should be certain. Forget it's not something that you need to pay attention every month. You said the charge of accounts once. So we said first step LLC second step, you know, business account, third step, cheap accounting software. You can buy zero today at seven bucks, you know, a month. You can basically go to herdler for ten bucks, you know, a month. You can find cheap online solutions that will bookkeeping for you, that will give you all of these expense classification automatically, directly from the bank account, it pull out the transaction, it clean it up, you know, such a life quality. If I don't need to do it manually or I don't need to wait until the end of the year to do it when I do it live and I have live information in front of me, I can make so much difference in my business. You said something that I hadn't really thought about with respect to mingling fun. So even if you have a business account and you are set up as a corporation, whether it's S Corp, C Corp, whatever it may be. I have all of my income to my business going into my business account, what I don't have and you just made me realize that this is something I need to do is I don't automatically take a percentage of of the income that comes into my business and put it in a separate account just to hold it there for taxes. And I have done this long enough to have a pretty good idea of what percentage that should be just to protect myself, but you're right. As a result, when I count up my income at the end of the year, I'm not taking the taxes out. So the numbers aren't really that accurate. I'm just seeing the blanket, you know, revenue that's coming into my business, but it's not really the right number as you were saying. So this idea of keeping things separate is so so important. Let's I want to talk about S Corp's because this is this is probably the most common type of structure that REALTORS find themselves doing once. And it's I know that S Corp's don't necessarily apply to every REALTOR based on how much income their business is producing, but it can make sense. I know for me, it made sense when I got to a certain income level in my business. And then it was a no brainer, but let's define because there's most of our audience probably doesn't understand the benefit of an of an S corporation. Actually, before we do that, I'm going to back up just one step. Let's first talk about the benefit of being an LLC before we we subcategorize into like S Corp C Corp. So let's talk about the benefit of it. You mentioned some of them, but I also the idea of a limited liability. Let's talk about what that means because REALTORS can be sued. And my understanding is there's protection built in to LLC structure that would make lawsuits a little bit more palatable or less scary if somebody comes after because they would come after the business correct versus the individual. Correct. And then what we usually recommend to those individuals that don't own or hold any assets within the LLC, you know, bring your commission, make sure that you have, you know, your expenses, maybe, you know, some some payroll liability, maybe some 401k liability, but there's no assets, which means if someone decide to go after you, you will find basically an empty shell, you know, LLC. There's no much assets, you can take the cash out and there's nothing to go after. But again, we're not building, you know, on the LLC to protect you, we want to make sure that you do things, you know, very ethically and also to make sure that you have the right insurance in place, which again, it's a business expense, those insurance as you mentioned. And then the tax allocation, DJ, if I need to ask you, you know, how much like if you're making two, three hundred thousand dollar a year, you know, if you're in your mind, how much would you set aside for tax? How much would you set aside? What is the percentage amount every check that you're set aside? So this is embarrassing because I don't do it and I don't really know, but if I had, I mean, this is embarrassing. I just do what my accountant tells me, which is also not. So if I had to guess, I would say 30%. Yeah, so again, so we are telling people don't put a dollar behind above 20. If someone is making about 250,000 dollar, your tax liability should not exceed, you know, 20%. And I think this is going back to your kind of the dollar amount, you know, the old equation was from every dollar amount, there's about 33% going to maintain business and 33% for tax and I maybe take all 33%. You know, each the formula in 2024 because of social media, because of digitalization, because the way that you can run a very efficient, you know, what you call business of one, you should not pay more than 20%, you know, in taxes. And you should not pay more than 20% of expenses to keep the lights on, which means in the new world of 2024, we see top agents taking 60% home. And when we think about, you know, profit first and profit first is kind of the envelope system, which is income minus my profit equal my expenses, it changed entirely mindset. Because if I put a goal that for every dollar coming to my business account, 50% is going into my side, is going to pay my taxes, which is my benefit, is going to fund my retirement, it's going to basically, you know, find my HSA, my health savings account, my FSA, my Flexible spending account for medical. And, you know, if I have kids, the 113, I can pay, you know, out of the business, $5,000 for my pre-after school expenses, it's to fund basically maybe my kids payroll, maybe my kids retirement. Again, there's so much things that I can keep money within the family. And then, you know, the 20% to keep the lights on, because we know it's almost like it's the toothpaste theory, you know, when we have more, we spend more, but when, you know, the toothbrush kind of, you know, the toothpaste is almost done, and we can squeeze, you know, another brush magical, you know, it's like a magic in the air, this is the same with business. You know, we see business owners, when they have more and the wealthy kind of, the wealth is coming their way, and the balance sheet become more kind of, you know, with cash and with some spending ability, we see people spend more money. And we want to let them know, no, continue to be disciplined about needs versus want, and you'll see that dramatically increase in your take home money. Yeah, I agree. I know I pay a lot less than 30%. Usually in the low 20s, maybe 20s is about where I'm at, because of the S corp structure, it is almost a bit magical. And something that will be very, very surprising in a good way, if you've never done it, you will find that boy, it is, it is a really nice structure. And so number one, you're limiting liability for in case anything someone decides that, you know, they thought you did something nefarious, they can go after it, but there's no assets held within the organization. So that of course protects or at least somewhat protects you. And then of course the tax benefits trickle down because my understanding is S corporations have a pass through, where in other words, can you explain what a pass through is. So in the corporate orders, two set of tax, you know, there's the C corp, the traditional tax corporate tax, it is double taxation, which means when I'm running a C corp, a traditional corporation, when the money comes in, I'm getting taxed, I'm paying, you know, corporate tax. And when I'm taking the money out in a salary or a dividend, I'm paying a second layer of taxation. LLC and S corporation are considerably a pass through entity, which we do is not corporate tax. When money comes in, you know, it's not getting taxed. When money get out, it's the first time that it's getting taxed and only on month federal rate. So S corporation has two classes of tax because they can take money out of the S corporation in two different ways. I'm taking money in the nature of wages, what to call reasonable compensation, because the IRS forces to take a reasonable compensation. So we'll pay some such security in Medicare, but it's definitely far beyond 100% of the bottom line or 100% of the net. This is why, you know, there's some margin of tax savings. And then what I'm not taking in the nature of a wage, I can take out in the nature of distributions. And those distributions are not subject to self-implum tax. So as an S corporation, again, the pass through element is only one layer of tax on your individual tax rate. There is no corporate tax on the S corporation level. And because in most cases, you will be the sole owner of the corporation. You ultimately, the entirety of the assets held within the organization are the businesses assets, but you are the sole owner. So ultimately, you know, we're all under kind of the same umbrella, but where really, really benefits agents is, as you said, the salary. So within an S corporation, I know that my accountant tells me every year, here's the salary, you are going to pay yourself. So, Shar says something very interesting. So that the IRS, you would think the IRS would have a very strict sort of algorithm or calculation to say, okay, you know, you DJ has enough, enough, as corporation, and your business makes, you know, X amount per year. So you're going to need to pay yourself, why? You know, there's, you would think there's a calculation, but there really isn't. There's just this idea of fair and equitable or what they fair and reasonable salary. It's really, and then I think they've tightened up the language a little bit in more recent years, but, because I know I used to pay myself a lot less of a salary, but I still pay myself much, much less as an employee. I am an employee, I'm the sole employee of my own corporation. This is how REALTORS do top REALTORS all do this. They become an employee of their of their corporation. They have to IRS says you have to pay yourself something fair and reasonable. So the accountant can work with you to say, okay, we think this percentage or, you know, this is the correct amount. This is, of course, you don't want to try to figure this out yourself. Definitely work with a tax professional. This is what they do. And, you know, and, and then what you'll find is your salary is probably much less than it would be if you were just a 1099 where you're paying taxes on all of it. So this is a huge, huge benefit. If I were to show you, and if I were to show you what I pay myself every year, you would be like, wow, DJ's not doing very well, but I'm actually doing quite well because my corporation holds the majority of those assets or assets. That's being just the income. And I pay myself all I only pay myself with the IRS tells me I need to and I use my account to figure out what that amount is. And I think this is something you to mention. Again, we're talking about common mistakes. You know, not knowing escort is a thing, one big mistake. Everybody should at least consider escort and for most. And 1099 real estate agents again, if you're making more than $80,000 a year, as corporation will pay, you know, big time. Second is the payroll concept, you know, because it's pretty odd, you know, being sole prop for the rest of my life. I never took payroll. I just took money out of the cookie jar. Now I need to be a little bit more disciplined, you know, I need to run the payroll and it runs distributions. People believe that I think the payroll is a chore or payroll is something bad. And they don't understand that actually payroll is your enabler. Payroll is the one that if you take it reasonably and you're not abuse the system, it allow you to not pay self employment taxes or your distributions, you know, because you actually prove the concept that, you know, how to use the W2 payroll concept. But second, paying self employment taxes or security Medicare, FICA is the enabler for banking, is the enabler for lending, is the enabler for retirement planning, is the enabler for so many great corporate level benefits. So part of the formations education system is we try to educate and break the status quo around payroll. And letting people know that payroll is actually a great thing for them to consider. Again, on the S-cooperation world, it's a must, but the reasonable compensation, how much money do you take, you know, as part of the payroll should basically be tailored for your needs for that financial year. Because if I don't need the payroll, I may go all the way to the floor, to the reasonable compensation allowed by the study that we're doing and will perform a study to make sure that those numbers can be dependent in case the IRS is asking. But think about it, there are years that actually I want to inflate it, my payroll, because I want to over-contribute into my retirement. Or basically I need my W2 for lending, because I know that many of our real estate agents, listener, savings, the retirement with rental properties. How do I buy a rental property, you know, how do I get a loan or mortgage without my financials, almost impossible. So what we want to do with an S-cooperation is not just to take advantage of all of the benefits, but to position the S-coorp in such an healthy way that you will be a banking sweetheart. That everywhere you go, people will want to lend you money because your financials will show that you're super strong and healthy. So, Shahar is bringing up a really good point, so I think this is an important topic. So I will tell you where people tend to get a little nervous is around refinancing a mortgage or purchasing a property when they have an S-cooperation status, meaning they have a company that they own a corporation and they pay themselves a fair and reasonable salary, which is going to be significantly less than if you were, because you're a W2 employee of your own company. But let's say you were working for a large corporation, not your own company, and you're going to be saving a lot more in those taxes. But what happens when you go to apply for a loan is when you show your own personal tax returns, it's going to paint a picture that might seem that, well, he just doesn't earn a lot of money. However, because this has happened to me a number of times whenever I've bought or refinanced, all I ever have to do is provide all the financials for my corporation and lenders understand this. It's not a scary thing. They go, okay, we get it. You really own this company and yes, you pay yourself a smaller salary. It has never been a problem for me. If I only showed my W2, it might be a problem, but because I own the company, I can show that and it does not create a problem around refinancing or getting a loan. You're absolutely right. In fact, it is something that as soon as they see that there's a corporation in S-Corp and they see the financials of the S-Corp not a problem, or at least has it been a problem in my experience. I have a question for you. This is something that I don't fully understand. I'm excited to, I don't know if there's a clear answer here, but I'd love to get your thoughts. Here's where I, every year around tax time, I always wonder what I'm supposed to do for this. I should just ask by accountant. My corporation, is it better for my, so I pay for individual health insurance. Very common for people who are real estate agents. If you don't have a spouse that maybe has a group insurance plan, you're probably paying individual on your own. Should me as the individual pay that, those premiums, or should the corporation pay those premiums for me, the employee? Curious to get your thoughts on that. So, regardless, how do you pay it? It will be a business deduction. So, your health insurance or self-employment health insurance will be a business expense. Sometimes it just depends on how do you basically engage with either the exchange or how do you engage with a third party or a group. You know, health insurance, because I know that some real estate agents are using associations or using sometimes like a mini-PO, like a professional employer organization, they're joining some solutions that they can run their payroll under a third party and therefore get corporate level benefits. So, it depends on this level of engagement. Regardless, we prefer that the business would pay all of your expenses, including all of your health insurance expense. But I think you mentioned something earlier, even if you're not as disciplined and you pay some of your expenses privately or in personal court, make sure that you have this cadence or discipline that every two weeks or a month, the business is reimbursing you for those expenses. So, now they become part of your business expense. But again, health insurance, your issue, we know, we are aware. By doing formations has three plans that we're offering specifically for real estate agents. It took us a while to find the right provider. But if you go to the formation website under benefits, you can see and start doing some calculations about health insurance coverage. And in many times it's a bit actually the coverage and the cost you can find out there. But regardless what you find as the health insurance, make sure that you run it through the business. And you also, again, health insurance is one of those real things that you need to include it actually in your W2. So, as an S corporation owner, you need to include your health insurance in the W2 and then you can deduct it under adjustment to income. So, overall, you get the deduction. But again, one mistake that people basically are doing, they're not including their health insurance cost on the business. And by mistake, they put it under medical expenses on schedule A on your ITEMAS deduction, you know, and it doesn't give them any benefit. So, again, regardless how do you pay for your health insurance, make sure that the business is expensive. And, you know, there's some really interesting expenses that S corporations can benefit from that I believe are unique to corporate structured entities, which for example, I have a monthly meeting that I hold at my condo for the business. I am the sole owner and sole shareholder of the business, but I am allowed to have, I believe monthly meetings and I believe even to events a year, I think as well. So, there are some really neat ways that you can increase your deductions by having, by taking advantage, and this is not exploitative, this is actually what the tax code allows for. And big corporations do this all the time. They of course take advantage of every opportunity to save on taxes that is applicable and ethical. And we want all of you to do the same thing. So, there's a lot of cool stuff that you will find out, but you need to have a tax professional that really is able to say, hey, you know, you're a shareholder in your company, did you know you can have shareholder meetings, this regular, and you can expense what the expenses might be for those meetings. So, there's some really, really cool stuff you can do. Also, same thing with transportation. I know there are some, I don't think it makes sense in my situation because I've asked, but maybe I'm wrong, is that there are times when your car expense, whether you're leasing a car, whether you've purchased a car and making payments, that can also be, it might make sense to hold that in the corporation's name or it might make sense to hold that individually and have the corporation help with the payments or, you know, I'm just, I'm not, I don't know. I don't know the exact structure, but there are a lot of opportunities. These are the questions that you bring to Shahar and his team and say, hey, I'm thinking about getting a car. Should I, should I lease, should I buy? These are, these are what we need help for because I'm actually in the process now, or I have a car that's been paid off forever. I don't really want to buy a new car, but I probably need to. And I'm like, okay, what's the best way to structure it? I don't want to figure that out. I don't know how to figure that out. I'm going to reach out to my accountant or Shahar and his team and say, hey, what's the best structure here? Does it make sense to lease? And I know there are situations where it can. And I just, you know, I don't know the answers to that. But these are the things you bring, of course, to your professional. So business use of auto is a huge topic. And today in the EV world, in the electric world, you know, it's even bigger topic just because of the incentives of electric cars. For real estate agents, you know, there's always the benefit of a car, which is a 6,000 pounds and over, you know, then you can get kind of truck, both of the appreciation treatment. When you mention about, you know, lease versus buy, usually it's an exotetax discussion, usually it's a cash flow discussion, it's a financial discussion. But again, if you know your numbers, if you know your cash flow, if you know how much money you should keep in the business, how much money you can get out, you know, you can make those discussion with yourself about what can I afford? Regarding to business use of auto, again, the mileage rate is 10 out of 10 times better, you know, unless it's kind of 2020, pandemic, when everybody is doing kind of the showing remote and they're not driving when people drive, usually the tax rate to deduct your mileage is way beneficial. Then, you know, my actual, because most of us, again, even if you drive an older car, the cost to maintenance today, most of our cars relatively low, which means I can take advantage by the fact that I don't have the actual expense and the IRS is giving me almost like a per-dem, you know, like a flat rate per mileage. So if I'm driving, you know, 20,000 miles a year, I can get, you know, close to 12, 13, 14,000 dollar of tax deduction, usually I don't have such a cost to maintain, again, repairs, gas, insurance, etc. So, know your options. DJ, what extra deduction that we love to speak about is also the business use of home. You know, ask real estate agents, when we wake up in the morning, first thing that we do, we walk into our home office, start checking, mails, what happened overnight, some research, what come available, you know, in the morning on MLS or whatever, you know, what's my pipeline going to look like, this is, you know, a real office. Let's deduct some of your home office expenses. And now when I'm actually traveling between, you know, my home office into my business office, into my brokerage, it's not a community, it's actually a business expense. So I'm gaining twice the benefit. And, you know, in general, what we just want to make sure the real estate agents understand is that the same is your curious and aggressive and a hassle, you know, at the top and at the front of the house, we want you to behave the same. You know, we want you to focus on your home, with your back office, because sometimes when people got into their back office, they're a little bit afraid of the system, they're insecure. You know, we know that there's this five and formal, the fear uncertainty and doubt of taking advantage of the system or the formal missing out on some expenses. Again, if you pick the right dream team, the right people around you, if you're curious enough to do a lot of learning. And by the way, we're telling the agent, they need to do also learning because they're coming from such a biased relationship. My accountant told me, no, no, no, no, no, how come you guys saying yes, yes, yes, yes, because your accountant sometimes is running in a gender that has the conflict between him and you and you need to find the partner that actually working for you and with you. And when you find those amazing people that will working with you as a partner, you will get a world of enablement of more things that you can actually achieve or your financial system. And also maybe realizing that there's things you're doing that put you at risk for audits and additional payments. And so having this tax professional on board and not just having one tax professional, I already have an account, I like her, she seems to be good. But here's what I don't do every couple of years, I should let someone else take a look and say, how does this, how does this look, you know, you audit, you know, yourself, you audit, you know, other things in your life, you should audit your your accountant. And the best way to do that is let, let formations, guys, I'm going to do this and the thought of even breaking up with my accountant is a tough one for me because I really enjoy them, but business is business and there's no harm in having someone else take a look. And you know what, I've actually had this done in the past and the other times people have looked at it in the last 13 years, I've had it maybe two or three times, I've had other accountants look at it, they go, you're actually pretty good, I would stay with the person. So, you know, but even if you're just getting confirmation that you have a great person, it's worth getting a second opinion, just like you would for any sort of major surgery, any sort of, you know, other health issue, your attorney issue, you know, you're probably going to see a couple attorneys before you make any big moves. Formations corp.com is the place to go. You can literally, I am going to do this, even though I love my account and I'm terrified of breaking up with her because I really like her, but I need to think about my business is best financial interest. And, you know, maybe she's not as up to date on the more recent, you know, sort of different changes in the tax code. So, I'm going to send my stuff over to Shahar and his team. In fact, you can, you can check me on it if you want to know if I really did it, reach out to me and I will let you know what happened, but I promise that that's what I'm going to do, because now I am scared, there's things I'm not doing. In fact, I know there's things I'm not doing correctly. So, I am excited to have Shahar and his team take a look at my corporate structure, see what I'm doing that maybe could be done better, maybe there's a tax savings, or maybe it's just, hey DJ, you're doing this thing and it's kind of risky. We don't want you to, we don't want to see you getting audited. I've never been audited. Thank goodness. I don't want to be audited. I certainly just don't want to go through that process. So, guys, even if you have a great accountant, even if you have a great account, reach out to formationscorp.com and reach out to Shahar and his team. His team, and this is what they do. They get, you can hear the excitement and passion in his voice. By the way, you know, somebody that gets excited about taxes is a unique individual. So, these are the people you want on your team. You want your, you know, your doctors to care about you, you want your attorney to care about you, you should also want your account to feel the same way. And guess what, every year around this time, I, all of a sudden go, oh my god, what do I get to expense? I never know. So, Shahar and his team are going to help you figure that out. They are going to give you guides and things that you can start tracking from here until, you know, until tax season. And of course, all throughout the year to help you do that as well. Okay, formationscorp.com is where to go. Shahar, I wanted to ask one other question related to taxes is any, any other, by the way, top agents are doing the so Shahar said something very important. I just want to reiterate, he said basically when you get to the $80,000 income level with your business or the income coming in, whether you're a 1099 or not. This is when you probably make sense to consider it being incorporated. So, you know, if you're at that level, even if you're not at that level, reach out to your accountant and find out if it makes sense. I know for me it took a couple of years when I first started in this business. My accountant said, you're good for now when you get to this level and it was right at that $80,000 level. And that's when he said, okay, now we're incorporating and it just completely changed my mind. I wanted us to just give ask a question about one other topic, which is talking about cash. So when cash comes in, we talk about different things we can do with it. We can put it in for we can save a pre tax dollars, put it into retirement savings. We can put we can put it in a taxable accounts for money markets, you know, taxable retirement taxable investment accounts. We can also consider investing in what we would call syndication deals, real estate deals that that are very interesting. And I didn't know about rescind, what we would call syndication deals until the last several years where I had extra cash. I needed it. I didn't want to save it. It wasn't going to be used for retirement, but it was going to be used for future goals that I have down the road. And my partner in business said, let's take some of that money and invest in these in like a commercial, a commercial a strip center, for example. So there are companies that run, you know, their property management companies or they own the they also own the land. And they rent it out to, you know, whoever, and you have to do your due diligence, of course, but basically the main benefit to me, even though I do get some sort of monthly amount they send me, I get all my money back, hopefully in a few years. But most importantly, is this a tax savings because I get what's called a K one at the end of the year. Can I talk just briefly about the brilliance of K ones and what they do to someone's taxes. So by the way, K one is what you get also for more escort. This is kind of the form. There's a past rent that is so when you go and syndicate, you know, with someone else, we see, you know, multi-family homes. We see more centers, we see some commercial development. And again, what we usually what those syndication are doing, they are leveraging your money, they are taking your money as part of the equity. And then they borrow money against it to again for a model of our improvements. The K one that comes back, you know, usually come negative. It's come usually when, let's say, put $50,000. So the first $50,000 that I get back will be my return of my investment. It won't be taxable. But what usually happens is that those syndication, those big LLCs have net operating losses as they're managing their syndication. And because you're a partial owner of that project, you're entitled to get percentage of those losses. So what we see, we see those K one coming negative. And because it's a passive income, you know, because, you know, it's it's it's not your core main of business. But because it's real estate, you can offset it against your actually commission income. So when we see, you know, people have the appetite for syndication, we encourage them kind of to time this indication the investment such that will every year, we'll have couple of K ones coming back as a negative and that negative income. And again, doesn't mean that negative income, it's negative cash flow. It's just book value. How do you use depreciation and loans and and debt basically to allocate to the to the different owners. But when that came K one coming back reported on schedule e page two and don't be confused with schedule e page one, which was your rental properties. If you have rental properties and K one and commission income, you know, you can actually do something super interesting, what's called tax harvesting. You can offset gains and losses and make a really really effective lower effective tax rate. Absolutely. So yeah, I get I get I think I get five K ones a year and they are all negative, which I love and that the negative number goes against some of my earnings in other parts of the business or or that's probably not the right way to say it. But it basically overall subtracts from my overall income. And that means less taxes guys. It's a structure taxable income. It's obviously your taxable income in the end, which means there is basically a both element to get you to a lower tax bracket sometimes. So you gain, you know, lower tax bracket to tax your overall contribution, but it's overall tax needs, but it's also offset real income one to one. And real estate agents has the benefit that most of them are what called real estate professionals in the eyes of the IRS, they're participating in real estate so much that the IRS allowed them, you know, to take those passive activities and take them against ordinary income, you know, one of the privileges that only real estate agents has due to the fact that such a big lobby, you know, in Washington DC. Well, that's true, that's true. That's I believe it's the biggest lobby of all industries is the real estate lobby. I don't know that that's that's true with the capital T, but I've heard that. So either way, it's a very powerful lobby and yes, there are benefits to being classified as a real estate professional with the IRS. So in fact, I do not believe I am classified that way. So I need to talk to you to see if that would be appropriate for my situation. So I'm going to chat with Shahar offline. And I'm also just going to send him all of my information to see number one, how is my account doing and a PC's opportunities, you know, there, there we go. And I'm going to reach reach out and possibly switch switch providers. So formations corp is where you go to learn all things Shahar and his team. This is what they do.

But they also of course specialize in the solutions to maybe considering moving beyond 1099 and you all will be, you know, this is a business. You want to run it like a business and you don't want to the time for just doing turbo tax. It is probably not the right call for a for a real estate agent.
