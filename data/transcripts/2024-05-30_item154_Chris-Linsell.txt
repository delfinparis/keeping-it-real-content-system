[00:02:42] Chris, welcome once again to the show.
[00:02:44] DJ, thanks for having me.
[00:02:45] Great to be back.
[00:02:46] Looking forward to chatting.
[00:02:48] Let's talk about Inman Miami.
[00:02:50] First of all, how was the event and what did you learn?
[00:02:54] So this is the first time that Inman connect has come to Miami and a couple of observations.
[00:03:02] It's really hot in South Florida.
[00:03:04] Come on, guys.
[00:03:04] I'm going there in a couple of weeks, I know.
[00:03:07] I'm not going to lie.
[00:03:09] I am a four seasons guy and I don't mean the hotel.
[00:03:13] I mean, I couldn't survive in the tropics.
[00:03:16] And I mean, it's nice to be there for a couple of days, but I can't be there my entire life.
[00:03:21] So glad to see you, Miami.
[00:03:23] Happy to leave you too.
[00:03:25] Apart from that, it was a great event.
[00:03:28] Brad Inman, shout out to you.
[00:03:31] My favorite thing about Brad Inman, founder of Inman, no longer the owner of Inman, he sold it.
[00:03:36] But my favorite thing about Brad is he has, I think since selling Inman, he has a cared less.
[00:03:46] And less about what other people think of him, which is fantastic.
[00:03:50] This is the way that you want to live your life.
[00:03:53] He has transitioned into his filter between the things that he's thinking and the things that he's saying, which was already pretty porous, has further most part just evaporated.
[00:04:05] And now we hear the uncensored version of exactly what is on his mind at all times.
[00:04:11] And I ran into him in the hallway during during the event because I was speaking out of panel, chatted for a little bit.
[00:04:19] And he is, he is loving every second of his life.
[00:04:23] And it's very clear from the event too.
[00:04:25] The event was vibrant and thoughtful, really provocative conversations.
[00:04:31] I got a chance to raise a few eyebrows and get a few people shifting uncomfortably in their seats as I was providing, you know, provocative and uncomfortable opinions.
[00:04:41] And just generally it's a really good event.
[00:04:44] I'm excited to have the Inman schedule expand out a little bit.
[00:04:48] So yeah, overall big takeaway though.
[00:04:52] People are interested in how their business is going to be different in the next year.
[00:05:00] And believe it or not, all of the conversation was not about the NAR settlements.
[00:05:06] It was also about the way that technology is affecting the way that people are planning for the next level of success.
[00:05:13] It is it is practically taken a place on the stage alongside the conversations with NAR.
[00:05:21] People are really becoming active in their pursuit of understanding the changing field of technology in real estate.
[00:05:28] It's pretty fascinating.
[00:05:30] Yeah, I'm glad that we're not just having another conversation about buyer representation.
[00:05:35] Those changes because I think the vast majority of agents I know are sort of worn out from those conversations about, oh my gosh, how am I going to get paid if there's a 0% co-op?
[00:05:46] And those I think were probably past I think agents have started to figure out that pathway forward there.
[00:05:53] But that's not going to be the focus of this conversation.
[00:05:55] I'm glad we're going to talk about AI because as a tech person myself, I come from the tech world prior to real estate.
[00:06:01] I'm very excited about anything that helps with efficiency and effectiveness.
[00:06:06] And I know you and I were talking about how AI could influence REALTOR behavior or rather REALTOR to do's.
[00:06:15] I guess is maybe even a better way to say it.
[00:06:17] We believe or you believe very strongly that there's going to be a lot of automation that comes as a result of this sort of next gen AI correct?
[00:06:26] Yeah, I really do.
[00:06:27] I think right now we are currently experiencing a season where well, let me back up.
[00:06:35] We are coming to a close potentially of the first season of AI in the life of real estate professionals.
[00:06:42] Most of us now, especially if you're listening to this podcast, you're included in this.
[00:06:50] We've discovered the role that AI can play in the existing iteration in its existing form in the way real estate operates right now.
[00:07:00] But most of the forward thinkers that I know that I talk to are starting to say to themselves, well, if this is what the business looks like now
[00:07:10] and this is what this technology does now and it is changing so quickly, we have to be thoughtful as real estate professionals about what it's going to look like next year, what it's going to look like shoot even in six months from now.
[00:07:25] And this was a lot of conversation that was happening at Inman, which was pretty exciting and pretty shocking frankly to hear.
[00:07:32] Because there are some major opportunities and some major vulnerabilities for real estate and especially for those who are providing tools in the space.
[00:07:46] I'll just go on record to saying I'm pretty biased here. Luxury presence has some incredible integrations with artificial intelligence into our products set.
[00:07:56] We have a lead generation full stack lead generation solution for folks that includes a practically magical interaction with our AI lead nurture tool.
[00:08:07] And it really is uncannily beautiful to talk to.
[00:08:12] And then we have AI built right into our mobile first presence co-pilot.
[00:08:17] And we believe that that's going to be the future, but there are a lot of real estate tech companies out there that are just kind of slapping AI on the banner of the home page of their website, but it's not really a feature set right now.
[00:08:31] It's just kind of a dongle.
[00:08:34] If you are using technology that does not integrate this new kind of wave of technology into its into its operating system, you should be worried that your tool is not going to be competitive any longer pretty soon.
[00:08:51] I think it's a great opportunity to reach out to our tech partners, the people we pay for things like our CRM, our photography, our title services,
[00:09:01] our eSignature platform, all of these tools that we rely upon, this is a great time to reach out because all these tech companies get really excited about AI.
[00:09:11] So they like talking about this, but to ask them, hey, can I see, can you share with me what's on what they call the developer roadmap for artificial intelligence in particular.
[00:09:21] Do you have any any uses that you're building out, for example, I use a to do list program called to do list, and that's just, you know, it's just a personal to do system.
[00:09:31] And I'm beta testing one of their new builds and they asked us if we could wave a magic AI wand, what would you like to see.
[00:09:39] And I said, what I'd like to see is yes, I still have to input all my to do's because it's not going to know my to do's unless I tell it.
[00:09:45] And but I said, I don't really want to organize my to do's every day and figure out what's most important, how much time I should spend.
[00:09:51] And again, I know this is asking a lot of AI, but what I really want is to wake up every morning and my to do a system or my CRM to say, here's your calling today, here's when you're calling it, we already put it in your calendar.
[00:10:02] And you know, I could make adjustments to teach it better to do it more effectively, but that's what I want.
[00:10:08] I'm excited for AI to start telling me, hey, this is the most efficient and effective way to get this done. And if we can do some of it for you, we will.
[00:10:15] Yeah, 100% in fact, to do us as a great example.
[00:10:20] And also, it is a reason for us to be thinking, you know, this is a basic to do list platform. I shouldn't say it's basic. I'm a to do is user as well.
[00:10:31] Oh, you are. Oh, nice. Yeah, you can do a lot of cool stuff with this platform, but the thing that is the like the most, the most equivalent sort of technology in real estate is the CRM.
[00:10:43] Yeah.
[00:10:44] It is a platform where you are managing your priorities and what you should do next based on the activity and needs of your clients.
[00:10:54] And think about how powerful CRMs become when AI starts taking the lead in understanding priorities where we don't have just these static algorithms that essentially you kind of set and forget.
[00:11:13] And they don't react based on the real time data that is coming into the platform.
[00:11:20] This is something that is going to really change the CRM space. And frankly, I think that there are going to be CRMs that are going to go away that can't effectively integrate this technology.
[00:11:32] And I will even go as far as sane. I think I made this prediction in a presentation once and practically got boot off stage when I said this.
[00:11:45] But the I think that Apple, the Apple iPhone with their introduction of AI into their operating system itself could be a CRM killer for a lot of folks.
[00:11:58] Imagine your contacts and your I message and FaceTime and your call logs and your email.
[00:12:07] Imagine all of those things with AI powered suggestion prioritization, even prediction of messaging.
[00:12:17] We're going to start.
[00:12:17] We're going to stop needing these analog tools as they exist right now.
[00:12:22] And if somebody is powerful as Apple starts doing it, the little guys who you are paying, you know, $40 a month for for a basic CRM, they're dead, they're dead in the water.
[00:12:33] They're not going to make it another year and a half. No one is going to if you don't offer that kind of service.
[00:12:38] Yeah, I'm really excited for Google Home Alexa Siri, the the assistance that were supposed to be smarter than I think they are at the moment.
[00:12:48] And we haven't seen much. If you use those tools, you probably have found there isn't been much hasn't been much progress.
[00:12:54] Yeah. So I think we're due for a revolution there and Siri, you know, is a great example of a tool that just doesn't work that well yet.
[00:13:02] But it's it's going to come. It's going to come where it's going to be your right. I think our phone that that operating system absolutely iOS or Android is going to somebody is going to figure out how to really build a good AI engine into it.
[00:13:17] And and then it's going to have access to all of our apps and all of the data if we allow it.
[00:13:23] And it's going to hopefully start organizing information in a way that's useful to us.
[00:13:26] I mean, if you haven't fool around with it yet, get chat GPT's app for I only have an iPhone. So I don't know about the Android, but the iPhone experience that the the app right now that you get access to
[00:13:42] to their newest model to to to 4.5 is an out yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:13:49] And it's got a live voice feature you just touch the microphone and you can talk to it. This is what Siri was supposed to be like.
[00:13:58] Imagine and it is really great. I mean, I'm going to be honest with you, I talked to it all the way home. I ignored my children. The day it came out. I that made them listen to me talk to the computer lady.
[00:14:08] And it is fascinating how thoughtful and responsive it is. And it's using all of its computing power to be able to have conversations with me,
[00:14:52] and I want to give you one other reason why, okay, I think I touched on this a little bit last last time we talked, but this really drives it home. Open AI is the company that powers chat GPT.
[00:15:06] They are continually training on new data. They're continually trying to find new data sets that they can incorporate, but there's a handful of data sets that they can't get a hold of because it's proprietary.
[00:15:18] One of those data sets is Google's review data. Google says chat GPT you can't have access to this because we want access to it. Well, Gemini, which is Google's model, is now training also on the reviews that are being left for businesses.
[00:15:35] So all of those reviews in your Google My Business profile, Gemini is reading them Gemini is ingesting them and we are, I want to say three product cycles away from Google's Gemini being able to answer questions like, hey, Gemini, what's the best real estate professional that I should work with in my area?
[00:15:56] And it's going to read your read those reviews and it's going to make a recommendation. This is not a toy anymore. This is a decision making engine.
[00:16:06] And if real estate professionals are not positioning themselves to be a part of the decision, you are positioning yourself to be a bartender in a couple of years because it is, it is happening.
[00:16:19] This is not a might be. This is a will be and it's just a matter of when.
[00:16:24] Yeah, that's a really important point is that these language or sorry that these AI engines are built on language models, which is are built on data sets.
[00:16:37] So for example, I believe open AI just inked a deal with news corp to get trained on on their content.
[00:16:45] And that might be something you want to consider too, if depending on how you feel about news corp and read it, I know also inked a deal with them.
[00:16:52] So they're, it's interesting, how this, how this data is going to be implemented, who's writing the code to influence things like, you know, making sure there isn't unconscious bias in there and all sorts of interesting safeguards in place.
[00:17:08] But maybe we can save that piece of it, the ethics of it for maybe another day, but, but I'd love to, it is an election year.
[00:17:16] And while we don't discuss politics on the show, we are agnostic, you know, but we do want to talk about how does the election year possibly influence impact buyers sellers and REALTORS.
[00:17:26] Yeah, yeah, it's an interesting pivot because actually I think they're very related in the sense that technology continues to have.
[00:17:40] I don't want to call them invisible effects on the way that we think about and perceive the things that are important to us, but because it's not really invisible, we have a pretty clear, we can draw a pretty clear line between the way that we use technology and the way that we feel about things.
[00:17:59] Politics is really no different. Politics is something that most of us wouldn't say governs our behavior, but if you step back and look at your decisions and look at the decisions of communities and markets, those decisions are often correlated with political activity within the United States.
[00:18:19] And one of the reasons why I think this is important to talk about is bank rate recently did a really interesting study on the typical home appreciation data based on election years.
[00:18:39] And here's the bottom line you can probably find out bank rate as long as that's not firewall or pay walled, but the bottom line here is that election years see higher appreciation rates for real estate than non election years.
[00:18:52] The fact is in 2004 this was an election year real estate prices went up 13 and a half over 13 and a half percent in 2003 the year before the election was 9 percent.
[00:19:08] It was an extra four and a half over four and a half percent in 2000 in 2000 real estate rates jumped 9 and third percent in 2001 the year after six and a third or six and two thirds percent.
[00:19:25] I mean the numbers continue to reinforce this fact election years spur greater real estate appreciation or at least greater real estate activity because there are a number of factors that are a part of this, but what we can see here is that prices tend to accelerate which means there's probably more buyers in the space than there is inventory.
[00:19:51] So what this is mean this means that if you're a real estate professional and you are thinking about coaching clients through timing and strategy this year.
[00:20:02] It is though you don't have a crystal ball we can look at the data and pretty reliably say if the choice is to sell in October of 2024 versus February of 2025 you're probably better off selling in October it's just the numbers right now.
[00:20:20] And you know there's a lot that can go behind that conversation but this is what the numbers say and you should take them and at least give your clients a chance to make their own decision.
[00:20:31] Yeah so just to make sure I understand this we in an election year historically the data suggests that home prices rise more so then there's some sort of positive correlation between election year and home pricing when one when one happens the other goes up.
[00:20:48] And then in the following year after an election we tend to see a lower amount of appreciation than then via the election year.
[00:20:57] Yeah there's there's this hangover following an election year there's a housing price appreciation hangover and you we do not appreciate as quickly.
[00:21:07] Yeah that might that might make sense we could speculate on why the year after is it could be just a sheer number of people going my guy lost the other person or my candidate lost the other person won and maybe I worried that they're going to do something to damage the country and so I'm going to stay put at the moment you know maybe it's just keeps who knows we don't know exactly why it happens and that's not the point of us telling us.
[00:21:28] Well you know I think like one thing that is pretty clear during an election year candidates tend to talk about the economy quite a bit actually and when sentiment in the economy when when economic sentiment in the United States is high homes just tend to sell for a little bit more it is just the reality people have confidence in the economy they are willing to spend a little bit more often though you know I I'm not going to I'm not going to say that this is a for sure but often.
[00:21:59] It's you'll see conveniently that interest rates tend to drop just a little bit during an election year in order for the economy the conversation around the economy to be a little bit more palatable and thoughtful and this tends to spur economic activity including indurable goods like homes the reason why I am confident I'm not crazy here is that you can actually find a similar graph when it comes to the economy.
[00:22:28] It's just to automobiles to even when automobile prices especially used cars have been really struggling in the last six months you can look historically at the typical price or the typical shrink in value because cars kind of go the other way that houses but cars depreciate last during election years then they do it otherwise so this is not this is not like a
[00:22:57] coincidence a phenomenon this is kind of part of the part of the cycle and we should expect it this year in fact I think it could be and I know unpopular here but this this could be a relatively controversial election it's going to be a lot of folks who are going to have conversations on both sides of the aisle the economy is going to be front and center in those conversations if you pair that with all of the kind of roominations happening in the real estate
[00:23:27] in the state space we might be in for kind of a wild ride this year I have a feeling we're going to see prices continue to move up despite the fact that the economy is is you know they'll be divided opinions on how the economy is performing.
[00:23:43] So if you're looking for a reason to reach out to prospective clients or past clients or people that are just interested in maybe considering a change in their real estate situation this would be an opportunity to say you know hey just so you know there's this data that suggests X and Y and I thought you should know that you know being this year homes tend to sell for a little higher than they will in future years or sorry in the following year after an election
[00:24:12] and we don't exactly know why that's happening but we know that historically the data does suggest that this is how it works I want you to be aware of that Mr. and Mrs. Homeowner so that you can make the right decision.
[00:24:23] And you know do your own research too like get into your MLS and understand the specifics for your particular market it is absolutely going to be different in San Francisco and Chicago and rural Michigan and you know upstate New York
[00:24:40] and South Florida all of these markets have their own conditions here but you have the data in front of you in fact it was there's a there's a report from McKinsey the the the consulting firm that was published last year didn't get a lot of attention but it is starting to resurface right now report that basically says real estate possesses an untapped volume
[00:25:10] of value via the data that we have in front of us meaning this is going to be a really valuable data set for AI specifically but right now we don't have AI chewing through the data the historical MLS data in the way that it will be probably a year from now.
[00:25:27] So right now real estate professionals get into your MLS understand the trends happening in your space you have exclusive access to all of the listing data that has been that has powered your market in the last year get in there and understand what are the trends in the last election year versus the the you're following an election what are the trends in your market last year versus this year do some very basic analysis here.
[00:25:57] You have access to data that nobody else does and I guarantee you if you're writing this down right now you are in the vast minority most people are listening to this like oh yeah I should do that but they're not going to do anything about it if you're actually writing this down you're going to get into your MLS and review that data you're going to be one of the 5% who actually takes action here and one of the 2% who was actually going to send anything to your clients so take advantage of it be part of that 2% get use your data
[00:26:25] okay ran over I love it so if you have a tool like info sparks in your MLS or some or some tool that allows you to look at this data please do it and also great opportunity to ask chat GBT to accumulate their information about this as well you want to confirm that data of course with your MLS data but a great opportunity to stay in my local market you know what what have historically have been the the home price movement election year after election year before election year.
[00:26:52] But yeah the great opportunity to reach out to clients and just provide some value in an election year Chris this is a great opportunity for us to wrap this conversation up we will talk again next month one of remind everyone if you're looking for a speaker Chris is spoken conferences all over the country he is consistently asked by national association of REALTORS in men lots of other regional and national conferences to come speak about his thoughts on real estate he's got opinions they are well research.
[00:27:22] And he's a fantastic dynamic speaker consider and reaching out to him to see if he'd be a good fit for your next speaking engagement Chris Lynn cell dot com is where you go we will have a link to that in the show notes Chris anything else we should plug for you.
[00:27:37] Come over to luxury presence we're doing some cool stuff here I know this is not a space for me to plug my gig at luxury presence but I genuinely have never been as confident as I am right now that I'm with a team that is providing the next generation of success for real estate professionals so.

Chris, welcome once again to the show. DJ, thanks for having me. Great to be back. Looking forward to chatting. Let's talk about Inman Miami. First of all, how was the event and what did you learn? So this is the first time that Inman connect has come to Miami and a couple of observations. It's really hot in South Florida. Come on, guys. I'm going there in a couple of weeks, I know. I'm not going to lie. I am a four seasons guy and I don't mean the hotel. I mean, I couldn't survive in the tropics. And I mean, it's nice to be there for a couple of days, but I can't be there my entire life. So glad to see you, Miami. Happy to leave you too. Apart from that, it was a great event. Brad Inman, shout out to you. My favorite thing about Brad Inman, founder of Inman, no longer the owner of Inman, he sold it. But my favorite thing about Brad is he has, I think since selling Inman, he has a cared less. And less about what other people think of him, which is fantastic. This is the way that you want to live your life. He has transitioned into his filter between the things that he's thinking and the things that he's saying, which was already pretty porous, has further most part just evaporated. And now we hear the uncensored version of exactly what is on his mind at all times. And I ran into him in the hallway during during the event because I was speaking out of panel, chatted for a little bit. And he is, he is loving every second of his life. And it's very clear from the event too. The event was vibrant and thoughtful, really provocative conversations. I got a chance to raise a few eyebrows and get a few people shifting uncomfortably in their seats as I was providing, you know, provocative and uncomfortable opinions. And just generally it's a really good event. I'm excited to have the Inman schedule expand out a little bit. So yeah, overall big takeaway though. People are interested in how their business is going to be different in the next year. And believe it or not, all of the conversation was not about the NAR settlements. It was also about the way that technology is affecting the way that people are planning for the next level of success. It is it is practically taken a place on the stage alongside the conversations with NAR. People are really becoming active in their pursuit of understanding the changing field of technology in real estate. It's pretty fascinating. Yeah, I'm glad that we're not just having another conversation about buyer representation. Those changes because I think the vast majority of agents I know are sort of worn out from those conversations about, oh my gosh, how am I going to get paid if there's a 0% co-op? And those I think were probably past I think agents have started to figure out that pathway forward there. But that's not going to be the focus of this conversation. I'm glad we're going to talk about AI because as a tech person myself, I come from the tech world prior to real estate. I'm very excited about anything that helps with efficiency and effectiveness. And I know you and I were talking about how AI could influence REALTOR behavior or rather REALTOR to do's. I guess is maybe even a better way to say it. We believe or you believe very strongly that there's going to be a lot of automation that comes as a result of this sort of next gen AI correct? Yeah, I really do. I think right now we are currently experiencing a season where well, let me back up. We are coming to a close potentially of the first season of AI in the life of real estate professionals. Most of us now, especially if you're listening to this podcast, you're included in this. We've discovered the role that AI can play in the existing iteration in its existing form in the way real estate operates right now. But most of the forward thinkers that I know that I talk to are starting to say to themselves, well, if this is what the business looks like now and this is what this technology does now and it is changing so quickly, we have to be thoughtful as real estate professionals about what it's going to look like next year, what it's going to look like shoot even in six months from now. And this was a lot of conversation that was happening at Inman, which was pretty exciting and pretty shocking frankly to hear. Because there are some major opportunities and some major vulnerabilities for real estate and especially for those who are providing tools in the space. I'll just go on record to saying I'm pretty biased here. Luxury presence has some incredible integrations with artificial intelligence into our products set. We have a lead generation full stack lead generation solution for folks that includes a practically magical interaction with our AI lead nurture tool. And it really is uncannily beautiful to talk to. And then we have AI built right into our mobile first presence co-pilot. And we believe that that's going to be the future, but there are a lot of real estate tech companies out there that are just kind of slapping AI on the banner of the home page of their website, but it's not really a feature set right now. It's just kind of a dongle. If you are using technology that does not integrate this new kind of wave of technology into its into its operating system, you should be worried that your tool is not going to be competitive any longer pretty soon. I think it's a great opportunity to reach out to our tech partners, the people we pay for things like our CRM, our photography, our title services, our eSignature platform, all of these tools that we rely upon, this is a great time to reach out because all these tech companies get really excited about AI. So they like talking about this, but to ask them, hey, can I see, can you share with me what's on what they call the developer roadmap for artificial intelligence in particular. Do you have any any uses that you're building out, for example, I use a to do list program called to do list, and that's just, you know, it's just a personal to do system. And I'm beta testing one of their new builds and they asked us if we could wave a magic AI wand, what would you like to see. And I said, what I'd like to see is yes, I still have to input all my to do's because it's not going to know my to do's unless I tell it. And but I said, I don't really want to organize my to do's every day and figure out what's most important, how much time I should spend. And again, I know this is asking a lot of AI, but what I really want is to wake up every morning and my to do a system or my CRM to say, here's your calling today, here's when you're calling it, we already put it in your calendar. And you know, I could make adjustments to teach it better to do it more effectively, but that's what I want. I'm excited for AI to start telling me, hey, this is the most efficient and effective way to get this done. And if we can do some of it for you, we will. Yeah, 100% in fact, to do us as a great example. And also, it is a reason for us to be thinking, you know, this is a basic to do list platform. I shouldn't say it's basic. I'm a to do is user as well. Oh, you are. Oh, nice. Yeah, you can do a lot of cool stuff with this platform, but the thing that is the like the most, the most equivalent sort of technology in real estate is the CRM. Yeah. It is a platform where you are managing your priorities and what you should do next based on the activity and needs of your clients. And think about how powerful CRMs become when AI starts taking the lead in understanding priorities where we don't have just these static algorithms that essentially you kind of set and forget. And they don't react based on the real time data that is coming into the platform. This is something that is going to really change the CRM space. And frankly, I think that there are going to be CRMs that are going to go away that can't effectively integrate this technology. And I will even go as far as sane. I think I made this prediction in a presentation once and practically got boot off stage when I said this. But the I think that Apple, the Apple iPhone with their introduction of AI into their operating system itself could be a CRM killer for a lot of folks. Imagine your contacts and your I message and FaceTime and your call logs and your email. Imagine all of those things with AI powered suggestion prioritization, even prediction of messaging. We're going to start. We're going to stop needing these analog tools as they exist right now. And if somebody is powerful as Apple starts doing it, the little guys who you are paying, you know, $40 a month for for a basic CRM, they're dead, they're dead in the water. They're not going to make it another year and a half. No one is going to if you don't offer that kind of service. Yeah, I'm really excited for Google Home Alexa Siri, the the assistance that were supposed to be smarter than I think they are at the moment. And we haven't seen much. If you use those tools, you probably have found there isn't been much hasn't been much progress. Yeah. So I think we're due for a revolution there and Siri, you know, is a great example of a tool that just doesn't work that well yet. But it's it's going to come. It's going to come where it's going to be your right. I think our phone that that operating system absolutely iOS or Android is going to somebody is going to figure out how to really build a good AI engine into it. And and then it's going to have access to all of our apps and all of the data if we allow it. And it's going to hopefully start organizing information in a way that's useful to us. I mean, if you haven't fool around with it yet, get chat GPT's app for I only have an iPhone. So I don't know about the Android, but the iPhone experience that the the app right now that you get access to to their newest model to to to 4.5 is an out yeah, yeah, yeah. And it's got a live voice feature you just touch the microphone and you can talk to it. This is what Siri was supposed to be like. Imagine and it is really great. I mean, I'm going to be honest with you, I talked to it all the way home. I ignored my children. The day it came out. I that made them listen to me talk to the computer lady. And it is fascinating how thoughtful and responsive it is. And it's using all of its computing power to be able to have conversations with me, and I want to give you one other reason why, okay, I think I touched on this a little bit last last time we talked, but this really drives it home. Open AI is the company that powers chat GPT. They are continually training on new data. They're continually trying to find new data sets that they can incorporate, but there's a handful of data sets that they can't get a hold of because it's proprietary. One of those data sets is Google's review data. Google says chat GPT you can't have access to this because we want access to it. Well, Gemini, which is Google's model, is now training also on the reviews that are being left for businesses. So all of those reviews in your Google My Business profile, Gemini is reading them Gemini is ingesting them and we are, I want to say three product cycles away from Google's Gemini being able to answer questions like, hey, Gemini, what's the best real estate professional that I should work with in my area? And it's going to read your read those reviews and it's going to make a recommendation. This is not a toy anymore. This is a decision making engine. And if real estate professionals are not positioning themselves to be a part of the decision, you are positioning yourself to be a bartender in a couple of years because it is, it is happening. This is not a might be. This is a will be and it's just a matter of when. Yeah, that's a really important point is that these language or sorry that these AI engines are built on language models, which is are built on data sets. So for example, I believe open AI just inked a deal with news corp to get trained on on their content. And that might be something you want to consider too, if depending on how you feel about news corp and read it, I know also inked a deal with them. So they're, it's interesting, how this, how this data is going to be implemented, who's writing the code to influence things like, you know, making sure there isn't unconscious bias in there and all sorts of interesting safeguards in place. But maybe we can save that piece of it, the ethics of it for maybe another day, but, but I'd love to, it is an election year. And while we don't discuss politics on the show, we are agnostic, you know, but we do want to talk about how does the election year possibly influence impact buyers sellers and REALTORS. Yeah, yeah, it's an interesting pivot because actually I think they're very related in the sense that technology continues to have. I don't want to call them invisible effects on the way that we think about and perceive the things that are important to us, but because it's not really invisible, we have a pretty clear, we can draw a pretty clear line between the way that we use technology and the way that we feel about things. Politics is really no different. Politics is something that most of us wouldn't say governs our behavior, but if you step back and look at your decisions and look at the decisions of communities and markets, those decisions are often correlated with political activity within the United States. And one of the reasons why I think this is important to talk about is bank rate recently did a really interesting study on the typical home appreciation data based on election years. And here's the bottom line you can probably find out bank rate as long as that's not firewall or pay walled, but the bottom line here is that election years see higher appreciation rates for real estate than non election years. The fact is in 2004 this was an election year real estate prices went up 13 and a half over 13 and a half percent in 2003 the year before the election was 9 percent. It was an extra four and a half over four and a half percent in 2000 in 2000 real estate rates jumped 9 and third percent in 2001 the year after six and a third or six and two thirds percent. I mean the numbers continue to reinforce this fact election years spur greater real estate appreciation or at least greater real estate activity because there are a number of factors that are a part of this, but what we can see here is that prices tend to accelerate which means there's probably more buyers in the space than there is inventory. So what this is mean this means that if you're a real estate professional and you are thinking about coaching clients through timing and strategy this year. It is though you don't have a crystal ball we can look at the data and pretty reliably say if the choice is to sell in October of 2024 versus February of 2025 you're probably better off selling in October it's just the numbers right now. And you know there's a lot that can go behind that conversation but this is what the numbers say and you should take them and at least give your clients a chance to make their own decision. Yeah so just to make sure I understand this we in an election year historically the data suggests that home prices rise more so then there's some sort of positive correlation between election year and home pricing when one when one happens the other goes up. And then in the following year after an election we tend to see a lower amount of appreciation than then via the election year. Yeah there's there's this hangover following an election year there's a housing price appreciation hangover and you we do not appreciate as quickly. Yeah that might that might make sense we could speculate on why the year after is it could be just a sheer number of people going my guy lost the other person or my candidate lost the other person won and maybe I worried that they're going to do something to damage the country and so I'm going to stay put at the moment you know maybe it's just keeps who knows we don't know exactly why it happens and that's not the point of us telling us. Well you know I think like one thing that is pretty clear during an election year candidates tend to talk about the economy quite a bit actually and when sentiment in the economy when when economic sentiment in the United States is high homes just tend to sell for a little bit more it is just the reality people have confidence in the economy they are willing to spend a little bit more often though you know I I'm not going to I'm not going to say that this is a for sure but often. It's you'll see conveniently that interest rates tend to drop just a little bit during an election year in order for the economy the conversation around the economy to be a little bit more palatable and thoughtful and this tends to spur economic activity including indurable goods like homes the reason why I am confident I'm not crazy here is that you can actually find a similar graph when it comes to the economy. It's just to automobiles to even when automobile prices especially used cars have been really struggling in the last six months you can look historically at the typical price or the typical shrink in value because cars kind of go the other way that houses but cars depreciate last during election years then they do it otherwise so this is not this is not like a coincidence a phenomenon this is kind of part of the part of the cycle and we should expect it this year in fact I think it could be and I know unpopular here but this this could be a relatively controversial election it's going to be a lot of folks who are going to have conversations on both sides of the aisle the economy is going to be front and center in those conversations if you pair that with all of the kind of roominations happening in the real estate in the state space we might be in for kind of a wild ride this year I have a feeling we're going to see prices continue to move up despite the fact that the economy is is you know they'll be divided opinions on how the economy is performing. So if you're looking for a reason to reach out to prospective clients or past clients or people that are just interested in maybe considering a change in their real estate situation this would be an opportunity to say you know hey just so you know there's this data that suggests X and Y and I thought you should know that you know being this year homes tend to sell for a little higher than they will in future years or sorry in the following year after an election and we don't exactly know why that's happening but we know that historically the data does suggest that this is how it works I want you to be aware of that Mr. and Mrs. Homeowner so that you can make the right decision. And you know do your own research too like get into your MLS and understand the specifics for your particular market it is absolutely going to be different in San Francisco and Chicago and rural Michigan and you know upstate New York and South Florida all of these markets have their own conditions here but you have the data in front of you in fact it was there's a there's a report from McKinsey the the the consulting firm that was published last year didn't get a lot of attention but it is starting to resurface right now report that basically says real estate possesses an untapped volume of value via the data that we have in front of us meaning this is going to be a really valuable data set for AI specifically but right now we don't have AI chewing through the data the historical MLS data in the way that it will be probably a year from now. So right now real estate professionals get into your MLS understand the trends happening in your space you have exclusive access to all of the listing data that has been that has powered your market in the last year get in there and understand what are the trends in the last election year versus the the you're following an election what are the trends in your market last year versus this year do some very basic analysis here. You have access to data that nobody else does and I guarantee you if you're writing this down right now you are in the vast minority most people are listening to this like oh yeah I should do that but they're not going to do anything about it if you're actually writing this down you're going to get into your MLS and review that data you're going to be one of the 5% who actually takes action here and one of the 2% who was actually going to send anything to your clients so take advantage of it be part of that 2% get use your data okay ran over I love it so if you have a tool like info sparks in your MLS or some or some tool that allows you to look at this data please do it and also great opportunity to ask chat GBT to accumulate their information about this as well you want to confirm that data of course with your MLS data but a great opportunity to stay in my local market you know what what have historically have been the the home price movement election year after election year before election year. But yeah the great opportunity to reach out to clients and just provide some value in an election year Chris this is a great opportunity for us to wrap this conversation up we will talk again next month one of remind everyone if you're looking for a speaker Chris is spoken conferences all over the country he is consistently asked by national association of REALTORS in men lots of other regional and national conferences to come speak about his thoughts on real estate he's got opinions they are well research. And he's a fantastic dynamic speaker consider and reaching out to him to see if he'd be a good fit for your next speaking engagement Chris Lynn cell dot com is where you go we will have a link to that in the show notes Chris anything else we should plug for you. Come over to luxury presence we're doing some cool stuff here I know this is not a space for me to plug my gig at luxury presence but I genuinely have never been as confident as I am right now that I'm with a team that is providing the next generation of success for real estate professionals so.
