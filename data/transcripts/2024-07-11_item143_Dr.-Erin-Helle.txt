[00:01:19] And now, on to our show.
[00:01:36] Welcome back to Grow With Me, Business, Wealth, and Health
[00:01:39] with Erin Helling.
[00:01:40] This segment takes you through all the things
[00:01:42] from skills to systems, to mindset, to goal setting,
[00:01:46] and most importantly, dream building.
[00:01:48] After all, business is about freedom and wealth,
[00:01:51] but those are subjective and specific.
[00:01:53] So we need to spend some time figuring out
[00:01:55] what the dream is.
[00:01:56] And then build a business to support that.
[00:01:59] That's what we're doing here in Business, Wealth, and Health.
[00:02:02] Before we dive in, I have something awesome to share.
[00:02:05] I know the webpage where you can connect with me
[00:02:07] and get handouts from my segments on this podcast.
[00:02:11] Check it out at BC Global Investments.com forward slash Keeping
[00:02:15] It Real.
[00:02:17] You can find my value proposition handout, a handout
[00:02:20] from today's training, and a link to book a call with me
[00:02:23] or to send me an email.
[00:02:25] Let's dive into today's training.
[00:02:27] We are talking about building strong client relationships.
[00:02:31] We're going to talk specifically about effective communication
[00:02:35] and client management.
[00:02:38] So these are essential skills for REALTORS.
[00:02:41] Client relationship management is imperative for you.
[00:02:45] Building and maintaining strong relationships with clients
[00:02:47] is crucial for your success in this very competitive industry.
[00:02:51] By the end of this training, you're going to learn
[00:02:52] some effective communication strategies,
[00:02:55] client management techniques, and customer service skills
[00:02:58] that will help you build long-lasting client relationships
[00:03:01] and generate some awesome referrals for future business.
[00:03:06] So let's first start talking about effective communication.
[00:03:10] So this starts with active listening.
[00:03:12] This is really important.
[00:03:14] It shows that you respect the person you're listening to.
[00:03:17] It shows that you understand them.
[00:03:19] And it really builds trust, which obviously
[00:03:22] is sort of like the benchmark here.
[00:03:24] This is the foundation of effective communication,
[00:03:26] effective client relationships is trust.
[00:03:30] So it's going to be sort of the under-arching theme
[00:03:32] throughout this entire segment.
[00:03:34] So I want you to practice some active listening skills
[00:03:38] and techniques as you're going about your day to day.
[00:03:41] Of course with your clients, but maybe just with your spouse
[00:03:43] or your kids.
[00:03:45] And you're going to do this by maintaining eye contact,
[00:03:49] nodding, asking clarifying questions,
[00:03:52] and summarizing what they've told you.
[00:03:54] I bet you'll find that when you summarize stuff,
[00:03:56] you'll realize you might not have been as clear as you thought.
[00:04:00] You might not have had the best communication.
[00:04:03] And when you summarize what, when you have someone else
[00:04:07] summarize what you said, that is made clear to you.
[00:04:09] And you might experience that same way
[00:04:11] when someone's talking to you and you return it
[00:04:13] and summarize what you think they just said.
[00:04:15] There might be some room for clarification.
[00:04:17] There's probably going to be.
[00:04:20] So this is hard, this is hard in and of itself.
[00:04:23] It's even harder on the phone, but it's still doable.
[00:04:26] So I recommend that anytime you get a chance
[00:04:28] to chat with your client or potential client over Zoom
[00:04:32] or Google Meet, take advantage of that, or even just FaceTime.
[00:04:37] Another thing that I really suggest that you guys do
[00:04:41] and that will really set you apart from other REALTORS
[00:04:45] is when you have an update or you need to communicate
[00:04:47] with a client, especially about something that's important.
[00:04:50] Record a video of yourself.
[00:04:52] Record yourself, not just your voice.
[00:04:55] Voice is good if you're like driving or something
[00:04:57] and you want to send a quick message
[00:04:59] because then people can't read into what they think
[00:05:02] your tone might be in a text message.
[00:05:04] But what's even better is a video of you talking
[00:05:09] to your video and giving them an update.
[00:05:13] So they can see your smiling, they can see like the ways
[00:05:15] that your voice is inflecting, they can see
[00:05:17] what's important.
[00:05:18] And then there's just no room for interpretation there.
[00:05:21] I'm sure you've all had a send a text message
[00:05:23] where someone takes it completely the wrong way.
[00:05:25] And sometimes it can be hard for you
[00:05:27] to understand why that person took it that way.
[00:05:30] But what's important to know is there is no,
[00:05:33] there's not tone in written text.
[00:05:36] It's usually how the receiver perceives it.
[00:05:40] So you have no control over that.
[00:05:43] So don't dwell on that.
[00:05:44] Just realize because you don't have control,
[00:05:46] switch it up so you don't have to deal with that at all
[00:05:48] and send them a message, send them a video of you
[00:05:52] with your smiling face, send them a video,
[00:05:55] a voice recording so they can hear that you're not angry
[00:05:58] or short with them or whatever.
[00:06:01] Those will go a really long way,
[00:06:03] especially if you're someone like me who's very direct
[00:06:07] and just sort of like productive in my communication
[00:06:11] and it can come off, really,
[00:06:13] it can come off as rude sometimes, honestly.
[00:06:16] And I don't mean it to be like that,
[00:06:18] at least not most of the time.
[00:06:20] So take it from me, some trips, tips and techniques
[00:06:24] that I've used to sort of alleviate that
[00:06:26] because you might think you're being really brief
[00:06:28] in your communication and being really effective
[00:06:30] and productive, but then when your client is upset
[00:06:32] and you've just spent all this time back tracking
[00:06:35] and making sure they understand you weren't upset
[00:06:37] and they shouldn't be upset because of what you said,
[00:06:39] you waste even more time doing that.
[00:06:42] So try to send voice messages more importantly,
[00:06:44] try to send video messages when you can,
[00:06:48] especially if it's like a big update.
[00:06:50] Like if maybe if you're doing new construction,
[00:06:54] you're by your bought a house and you're went out
[00:06:56] to see the house, like do a video right then and there.
[00:06:59] Show them what you're talking about,
[00:07:00] show them that you're at the site.
[00:07:02] It will really go a long way for customer service, okay?
[00:07:06] Next up, an effective communication is clear
[00:07:09] and concise communication.
[00:07:11] So we wanna talk about the power here
[00:07:14] of simple and straightforward communication.
[00:07:17] Make sure that you're using professional language,
[00:07:20] make sure you're using plain language
[00:07:22] with no jargon or slang, but also make sure
[00:07:25] that you're not using acronyms or terms
[00:07:28] that your client may not understand.
[00:07:31] Because if your client is confused,
[00:07:34] then they're probably going to end up unhappy
[00:07:36] or left in the dark and that's the last thing you want.
[00:07:39] So make sure you are being not just clear,
[00:07:44] but also make sure that they are understanding
[00:07:47] the things that you say and ask for clarity too to make sure.
[00:07:51] So be careful not to be too direct as again,
[00:07:54] this can come up as rude or unprofessional.
[00:07:57] So here's a couple of tips for clear and concise
[00:07:59] written communication.
[00:08:01] So for emails, use a clear and descriptive subject line.
[00:08:06] The subject line should give the recipient
[00:08:07] a good idea of the email's content and purpose.
[00:08:11] Keep it brief and to the point,
[00:08:14] avoid lengthy paragraphs and unnecessary details,
[00:08:16] get to the main point of the email quickly.
[00:08:19] Use bullet points or numbered lists.
[00:08:21] If you're conveying multiple pieces of information,
[00:08:24] use these bullet points or lists
[00:08:27] and this can enhance readability and clarity.
[00:08:30] Watch your tone.
[00:08:31] Ensure your tone is professional and polite,
[00:08:34] avoid using language that could be
[00:08:36] innovative as interpreted as dismissive or unprofessional.
[00:08:40] And notice that what could interpret it,
[00:08:43] that someone could interpret what you're saying
[00:08:45] as dismissive or unprofessional.
[00:08:46] That doesn't mean what you're saying
[00:08:48] is dismissive or unprofessional,
[00:08:50] but it could be interpreted that way.
[00:08:52] So you want to make an effort to avoid that
[00:08:55] and your communication off the bat.
[00:08:58] Proofread before sending always,
[00:09:00] always proofread your emails for spelling, grammar,
[00:09:03] and clarity before hitting the send button.
[00:09:06] If it's particularly complex
[00:09:08] or if you're just having a hard time being brief
[00:09:12] or getting to the point,
[00:09:14] have someone else read it to make sure that they understand it.
[00:09:17] Someone who doesn't already have an idea
[00:09:19] of what you're talking about,
[00:09:20] so that it's clear that it's very well understood
[00:09:24] from start to finish, okay?
[00:09:26] Text messages, get to the point.
[00:09:28] Text messages are meant to be concise.
[00:09:31] State your purpose clearly and succinctly.
[00:09:33] Avoid abbreviations and slang.
[00:09:36] While some familiar informality is acceptable,
[00:09:39] avoid using excessive abbreviations or slang
[00:09:42] that could be misunderstood.
[00:09:44] React, respect the recipients' timeline.
[00:09:47] Be mindful of the recipients' schedule
[00:09:49] and avoid sending non-urgent messages during off hours, right?
[00:09:53] So if it's something that's not important,
[00:09:55] don't send it on a Friday night.
[00:09:57] Use emojis wisely.
[00:09:59] If appropriate, use emojis to convey tone or emotion,
[00:10:03] but do so sparingly and unprofessionally.
[00:10:06] Okay, so this is good when you are being really direct
[00:10:09] or you know that this is a particularly emotional thing
[00:10:14] for your clients, like throw a smiley face in there, right?
[00:10:18] Or if you suspect that the seller's agent
[00:10:23] is being snarky or something like that
[00:10:24] and you are relaying a message,
[00:10:27] like put a little winky emoji in there or something
[00:10:30] or be really clear about what you're trying to say.
[00:10:34] Include a call to action, clearly state what action,
[00:10:37] if any of the recipient needs to take in response
[00:10:39] to the message.
[00:10:42] Okay, so moving on to client management strategies.
[00:10:45] So this first and most important one is regular
[00:10:48] and proactive communications.
[00:10:52] Regular check-ins with clients are so important.
[00:10:55] People are gonna get unhappy or even upset very quickly
[00:10:59] if they feel that they're being left in the dark.
[00:11:02] So you need to be proactive in this communication
[00:11:04] and anticipate their needs and provide updates
[00:11:07] without being prompted.
[00:11:08] Even if there is no update, check in with them
[00:11:11] and let them know that.
[00:11:12] Hey, I don't have an update for you,
[00:11:14] like maybe on a Friday afternoon,
[00:11:16] I know we were waiting on this,
[00:11:17] I don't have an update yet,
[00:11:18] I will check in with you first thing Monday morning.
[00:11:20] Always make sure they know what the next step is
[00:11:23] or when they expect to hear from you next.
[00:11:25] Utilize various communication channels,
[00:11:27] phone calls, emails, text messages, and in-person meetings.
[00:11:31] Don't be the REALTOR that only texts.
[00:11:34] I know it's efficient,
[00:11:35] but I'm telling you right now it irritates a lot of people.
[00:11:38] And maybe you have a buyer or a seller who appreciates
[00:11:43] just text message communication,
[00:11:45] that's okay, but just make sure you clear that with them first.
[00:11:49] Next thing is setting realistic expectations.
[00:11:52] So you want to manage client expectations
[00:11:54] from the very start,
[00:11:55] so be straightforward and honest,
[00:11:57] walk them through the process
[00:11:58] and share what could go wrong or cause delays.
[00:12:01] Clearly explain to them the entire process,
[00:12:04] whether they're buying or selling,
[00:12:05] make sure they know what the timeline is,
[00:12:08] make sure what they know about any potential challenges.
[00:12:11] Keep clients informed of any changes or delays promptly.
[00:12:14] Bad news does not get better with time,
[00:12:17] so share things as you learn them.
[00:12:20] Referral generation,
[00:12:21] let's talk about that next.
[00:12:23] Building trust in loyalty is, again, first and foremost.
[00:12:27] So you need to provide exceptional service
[00:12:29] in order to do this.
[00:12:31] Be authentically you.
[00:12:33] Take care of them as best you can
[00:12:35] and get help when you need it.
[00:12:36] If you don't know something or you're stuck,
[00:12:40] there are so many resources out there to help you.
[00:12:42] You're broker, you're team leader,
[00:12:44] if you have one other agent, you can reach out to me.
[00:12:47] Don't just leave your client hanging.
[00:12:51] Exceed their expectations throughout the transaction.
[00:12:54] Ask for their feedback,
[00:12:55] especially when you feel like their attitude has shifted.
[00:12:58] So the best time to get a review from them
[00:13:00] is after they've closed and everyone's happy and on a high.
[00:13:03] But you can ask them for feedback at any point
[00:13:05] during a transaction.
[00:13:06] If you feel like suddenly your clients gone cold with you
[00:13:09] or suddenly they're really short with you,
[00:13:11] ask them why, ask them what happened,
[00:13:14] ask them what's bothering them
[00:13:15] so that you can come to a solution
[00:13:18] and meet their needs and ultimately make them happy.
[00:13:23] So when we are asking for referrals as we build this
[00:13:28] loyalty and trust, we can now have an opportunity
[00:13:31] to ask for referrals.
[00:13:33] You're not just gonna,
[00:13:34] you're not gonna ask for a referral from somebody
[00:13:35] who wasn't happy with your service
[00:13:37] and you're not gonna ask for a referral
[00:13:39] on your first phone call with them.
[00:13:40] Timing is really important.
[00:13:42] So the best time to ask for referrals
[00:13:44] is when your customer or client is highly satisfied.
[00:13:47] So this is the happiest moment.
[00:13:49] That's what it's typically referred to as.
[00:13:51] And they recognize the value your business has provided
[00:13:54] has provided for them.
[00:13:56] Asking for referrals right after a customer closes
[00:13:59] or achieve a significant win from your services
[00:14:01] is an opportune moment to request referrals.
[00:14:05] It's important to strike the right balance
[00:14:07] and not come across as pushy or opportunistic.
[00:14:11] Timing is also crucial if you're asking for referrals
[00:14:14] through email.
[00:14:16] Schedule the email at a time when it's most convenient
[00:14:18] for the customer and likely that you will receive a response.
[00:14:22] For example, it may be best to avoid sending an email
[00:14:25] on a busy Friday afternoon
[00:14:26] when people are preparing to log off for the weekend.
[00:14:29] Don't expect a response if you send it at that time.
[00:14:32] Overall, there's no one-size-fits-all answer
[00:14:34] to the timing of asking for referrals
[00:14:36] as it can vary based on individual circumstances
[00:14:38] and customer interactions.
[00:14:40] It is essential to observe the customer's level
[00:14:42] of satisfaction and choose a moment
[00:14:44] when they're most receptive to making referrals.
[00:14:48] You also want to utilize online platforms
[00:14:50] and social media to encourage referrals
[00:14:52] and make sure that people know what services you offer,
[00:14:55] how you can provide value and what you can do for those people.
[00:15:00] Always, always, always be adding to your email list.
[00:15:03] This is where your future business will come from.
[00:15:05] If you're recruiting agents or attracting them
[00:15:07] to your brokerage, share that too.
[00:15:09] Share that on emails, share that in text messages,
[00:15:12] send them a thank you and just remind them
[00:15:14] what you do, what you offer,
[00:15:16] and ask them if you know anybody who could benefit
[00:15:18] from your services.
[00:15:21] Our last section here is customer service skills.
[00:15:24] This really revolves around responsiveness as a REALTOR.
[00:15:28] So always return calls, emails, and messages in a timely manner.
[00:15:32] If you can't or you're engaged,
[00:15:34] let them know when you'll get back to them.
[00:15:37] Utilize technology tools like automation
[00:15:39] and customer relationship management software, CRM.
[00:15:43] Use your transaction coordinator or hire an assistant.
[00:15:48] Okay, so in conclusion, building strong relationships
[00:15:51] is an ongoing process that requires effective communication,
[00:15:54] client management strategies and exceptional customer service skills.
[00:15:59] By following these practices,
[00:16:00] you will not only build strong connections with your clients,
[00:16:03] but also generate valuable referrals for your business.
[00:16:06] Remember, happy clients are the foundation of your success as a REALTOR.
[00:16:10] That's it for today.

I know the webpage where you can connect with me and get handouts from my segments on this podcast. Check it out at BC Global Investments.com forward slash Keeping It Real. You can find my value proposition handout, a handout from today's training, and a link to book a call with me or to send me an email. Let's dive into today's training. We are talking about building strong client relationships. We're going to talk specifically about effective communication and client management. So these are essential skills for REALTORS. Client relationship management is imperative for you. Building and maintaining strong relationships with clients is crucial for your success in this very competitive industry. By the end of this training, you're going to learn some effective communication strategies, client management techniques, and customer service skills that will help you build long-lasting client relationships and generate some awesome referrals for future business. So let's first start talking about effective communication. So this starts with active listening. This is really important. It shows that you respect the person you're listening to. It shows that you understand them. And it really builds trust, which obviously is sort of like the benchmark here. This is the foundation of effective communication, effective client relationships is trust. So it's going to be sort of the under-arching theme throughout this entire segment. So I want you to practice some active listening skills and techniques as you're going about your day to day. Of course with your clients, but maybe just with your spouse or your kids. And you're going to do this by maintaining eye contact, nodding, asking clarifying questions, and summarizing what they've told you. I bet you'll find that when you summarize stuff, you'll realize you might not have been as clear as you thought. You might not have had the best communication. And when you summarize what, when you have someone else summarize what you said, that is made clear to you. And you might experience that same way when someone's talking to you and you return it and summarize what you think they just said. There might be some room for clarification. There's probably going to be. So this is hard, this is hard in and of itself. It's even harder on the phone, but it's still doable. So I recommend that anytime you get a chance to chat with your client or potential client over Zoom or Google Meet, take advantage of that, or even just FaceTime. Another thing that I really suggest that you guys do and that will really set you apart from other REALTORS is when you have an update or you need to communicate with a client, especially about something that's important. Record a video of yourself. Record yourself, not just your voice. Voice is good if you're like driving or something and you want to send a quick message because then people can't read into what they think your tone might be in a text message. But what's even better is a video of you talking to your video and giving them an update. So they can see your smiling, they can see like the ways that your voice is inflecting, they can see what's important. And then there's just no room for interpretation there. I'm sure you've all had a send a text message where someone takes it completely the wrong way. And sometimes it can be hard for you to understand why that person took it that way. But what's important to know is there is no, there's not tone in written text. It's usually how the receiver perceives it. So you have no control over that. So don't dwell on that. Just realize because you don't have control, switch it up so you don't have to deal with that at all and send them a message, send them a video of you with your smiling face, send them a video, a voice recording so they can hear that you're not angry or short with them or whatever. Those will go a really long way, especially if you're someone like me who's very direct and just sort of like productive in my communication and it can come off, really, it can come off as rude sometimes, honestly. And I don't mean it to be like that, at least not most of the time. So take it from me, some trips, tips and techniques that I've used to sort of alleviate that because you might think you're being really brief in your communication and being really effective and productive, but then when your client is upset and you've just spent all this time back tracking and making sure they understand you weren't upset and they shouldn't be upset because of what you said, you waste even more time doing that. So try to send voice messages more importantly, try to send video messages when you can, especially if it's like a big update. Like if maybe if you're doing new construction, you're by your bought a house and you're went out to see the house, like do a video right then and there. Show them what you're talking about, show them that you're at the site. It will really go a long way for customer service, okay? Next up, an effective communication is clear and concise communication. So we wanna talk about the power here of simple and straightforward communication. Make sure that you're using professional language, make sure you're using plain language with no jargon or slang, but also make sure that you're not using acronyms or terms that your client may not understand. Because if your client is confused, then they're probably going to end up unhappy or left in the dark and that's the last thing you want. So make sure you are being not just clear, but also make sure that they are understanding the things that you say and ask for clarity too to make sure. So be careful not to be too direct as again, this can come up as rude or unprofessional. So here's a couple of tips for clear and concise written communication. So for emails, use a clear and descriptive subject line. The subject line should give the recipient a good idea of the email's content and purpose. Keep it brief and to the point, avoid lengthy paragraphs and unnecessary details, get to the main point of the email quickly. Use bullet points or numbered lists. If you're conveying multiple pieces of information, use these bullet points or lists and this can enhance readability and clarity. Watch your tone. Ensure your tone is professional and polite, avoid using language that could be innovative as interpreted as dismissive or unprofessional. And notice that what could interpret it, that someone could interpret what you're saying as dismissive or unprofessional. That doesn't mean what you're saying is dismissive or unprofessional, but it could be interpreted that way. So you want to make an effort to avoid that and your communication off the bat. Proofread before sending always, always proofread your emails for spelling, grammar, and clarity before hitting the send button. If it's particularly complex or if you're just having a hard time being brief or getting to the point, have someone else read it to make sure that they understand it. Someone who doesn't already have an idea of what you're talking about, so that it's clear that it's very well understood from start to finish, okay? Text messages, get to the point. Text messages are meant to be concise. State your purpose clearly and succinctly. Avoid abbreviations and slang. While some familiar informality is acceptable, avoid using excessive abbreviations or slang that could be misunderstood. React, respect the recipients' timeline. Be mindful of the recipients' schedule and avoid sending non-urgent messages during off hours, right? So if it's something that's not important, don't send it on a Friday night. Use emojis wisely. If appropriate, use emojis to convey tone or emotion, but do so sparingly and unprofessionally. Okay, so this is good when you are being really direct or you know that this is a particularly emotional thing for your clients, like throw a smiley face in there, right? Or if you suspect that the seller's agent is being snarky or something like that and you are relaying a message, like put a little winky emoji in there or something or be really clear about what you're trying to say. Include a call to action, clearly state what action, if any of the recipient needs to take in response to the message. Okay, so moving on to client management strategies. So this first and most important one is regular and proactive communications. Regular check-ins with clients are so important. People are gonna get unhappy or even upset very quickly if they feel that they're being left in the dark. So you need to be proactive in this communication and anticipate their needs and provide updates without being prompted. Even if there is no update, check in with them and let them know that. Hey, I don't have an update for you, like maybe on a Friday afternoon, I know we were waiting on this, I don't have an update yet, I will check in with you first thing Monday morning. Always make sure they know what the next step is or when they expect to hear from you next. Utilize various communication channels, phone calls, emails, text messages, and in-person meetings. Don't be the REALTOR that only texts. I know it's efficient, but I'm telling you right now it irritates a lot of people. And maybe you have a buyer or a seller who appreciates just text message communication, that's okay, but just make sure you clear that with them first. Next thing is setting realistic expectations. So you want to manage client expectations from the very start, so be straightforward and honest, walk them through the process and share what could go wrong or cause delays. Clearly explain to them the entire process, whether they're buying or selling, make sure they know what the timeline is, make sure what they know about any potential challenges. Keep clients informed of any changes or delays promptly. Bad news does not get better with time, so share things as you learn them. Referral generation, let's talk about that next. Building trust in loyalty is, again, first and foremost. So you need to provide exceptional service in order to do this. Be authentically you. Take care of them as best you can and get help when you need it. If you don't know something or you're stuck, there are so many resources out there to help you. You're broker, you're team leader, if you have one other agent, you can reach out to me. Don't just leave your client hanging. Exceed their expectations throughout the transaction. Ask for their feedback, especially when you feel like their attitude has shifted. So the best time to get a review from them is after they've closed and everyone's happy and on a high. But you can ask them for feedback at any point during a transaction. If you feel like suddenly your clients gone cold with you or suddenly they're really short with you, ask them why, ask them what happened, ask them what's bothering them so that you can come to a solution and meet their needs and ultimately make them happy. So when we are asking for referrals as we build this loyalty and trust, we can now have an opportunity to ask for referrals. You're not just gonna, you're not gonna ask for a referral from somebody who wasn't happy with your service and you're not gonna ask for a referral on your first phone call with them. Timing is really important. So the best time to ask for referrals is when your customer or client is highly satisfied. So this is the happiest moment. That's what it's typically referred to as. And they recognize the value your business has provided has provided for them. Asking for referrals right after a customer closes or achieve a significant win from your services is an opportune moment to request referrals. It's important to strike the right balance and not come across as pushy or opportunistic. Timing is also crucial if you're asking for referrals through email. Schedule the email at a time when it's most convenient for the customer and likely that you will receive a response. For example, it may be best to avoid sending an email on a busy Friday afternoon when people are preparing to log off for the weekend. Don't expect a response if you send it at that time. Overall, there's no one-size-fits-all answer to the timing of asking for referrals as it can vary based on individual circumstances and customer interactions. It is essential to observe the customer's level of satisfaction and choose a moment when they're most receptive to making referrals. You also want to utilize online platforms and social media to encourage referrals and make sure that people know what services you offer, how you can provide value and what you can do for those people. Always, always, always be adding to your email list. This is where your future business will come from. If you're recruiting agents or attracting them to your brokerage, share that too. Share that on emails, share that in text messages, send them a thank you and just remind them what you do, what you offer, and ask them if you know anybody who could benefit from your services. Our last section here is customer service skills. This really revolves around responsiveness as a REALTOR. So always return calls, emails, and messages in a timely manner. If you can't or you're engaged, let them know when you'll get back to them. Utilize technology tools like automation and customer relationship management software, CRM. Use your transaction coordinator or hire an assistant. Okay, so in conclusion, building strong relationships is an ongoing process that requires effective communication, client management strategies and exceptional customer service skills. By following these practices, you will not only build strong connections with your clients, but also generate valuable referrals for your business. Remember, happy clients are the foundation of your success as a REALTOR. That's it for today.
