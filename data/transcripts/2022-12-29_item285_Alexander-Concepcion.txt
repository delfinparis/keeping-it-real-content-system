[00:02:38] Today on this show is Alexander Concepcion
[00:02:41] from Daco Street, locating, serving Austin, Houston,
[00:02:46] and Dallas.
[00:02:46] Let me tell you more about Alexander.
[00:02:48] Now, Alexander is a Cuban American born
[00:02:51] and raised in Miami, Florida.
[00:02:53] He moved to Austin to chase riches and tacos.
[00:02:56] After trying a bunch of random gigs going broke,
[00:03:00] he stumbled into apartment location services
[00:03:02] and created Taco Street, locating.
[00:03:04] Now, after more than 400 deals and 700,000 in revenue,
[00:03:09] he's becoming one of the most successful
[00:03:10] independent apartment locators in Texas,
[00:03:14] probably in the country, not just Texas.
[00:03:16] When he's not locating, he's working on a book
[00:03:19] that he's writing.
[00:03:20] He's also being a low budget Anthony Bourdain.
[00:03:23] That's not the book.
[00:03:24] That's a, uh, Hama being a low budget Anthony Bourdain,
[00:03:27] cooking, playing disc golf, and also working out.
[00:03:30] I have two websites I want everybody to check out.
[00:03:32] First, just to see what Alex and her is all about,
[00:03:35] Taco Street locating is his apartment, locating service.
[00:03:38] But he also teaches and we were just chatting about this beforehand.
[00:03:42] We believe the first and maybe only course out there
[00:03:46] for agents to learn how to do apartment locating.
[00:03:49] So the best way to learn about this course
[00:03:52] and we're going to talk about it today,
[00:03:54] visit the website apartment locating mastery.com.
[00:03:57] By the way, both of those links are in the show notes.
[00:04:00] So just scroll to the show notes.
[00:04:01] Click on a particular apartment locating mastery
[00:04:04] to see his course.
[00:04:06] Alexander, I keep wanting to call you Alex
[00:04:08] because I have a very close friend named Alex.
[00:04:10] So I apologize.
[00:04:11] I might stumble over that here.
[00:04:13] But anyway, Alexander, welcome to the show.
[00:04:16] Thank you.
[00:04:16] Yeah, I used to go by Alex, but I switched to Alexander this year
[00:04:22] because it's my actual full name and I just like it more.
[00:04:26] So there's just a lot, there's lots of Alexander.
[00:04:28] So I'm like, I'm going with it.
[00:04:30] Mine.
[00:04:30] I like it.
[00:04:32] I think there's some names that sound better shortened.
[00:04:34] And I think Alexander is not one of those names.
[00:04:37] I like it better.
[00:04:38] It sort of works all the way through.
[00:04:40] No, my name is a nickname.
[00:04:42] So I'm sort of not one to talk.
[00:04:43] But my name is actually, it's a Spanish name.
[00:04:47] It doesn't, I'm not from any sort of Spanish speaking country.
[00:04:54] But my name is Delphin is the D and J is walking.
[00:04:58] So and I don't look particularly Spanish.
[00:05:01] I don't think so.
[00:05:02] I DJs just a heck of a lot easier for people to absorb.
[00:05:06] But anyway, we're not here to talk about my name.
[00:05:10] But I'm so excited to have you because this came at just a
[00:05:13] perfect time.
[00:05:14] So we have to give you a little background.
[00:05:16] So right now, you know, by the time you're listening to this,
[00:05:19] it's probably mid December and Alexander and I recording this
[00:05:22] late late November, just actually a few days before Thanksgiving.
[00:05:26] And we have about, well, the two, I don't know,
[00:05:29] between seven and 800 agents here at our company.
[00:05:32] And we do mostly sales and we've tried over the years to
[00:05:36] really introduce our brokers, by the way, in Illinois,
[00:05:40] every REALTOR is called a broker.
[00:05:41] So I know that's not the way it is in every state.
[00:05:43] So I'll just say REALTOR.
[00:05:44] But we tried to take to really encourage our REALTOR's in
[00:05:47] between sales to do some, do some rentals because specifically
[00:05:51] here in Chicago, obviously, big rental market and lots of money
[00:05:55] to be had.
[00:05:56] Most agents, however, don't get their license to do rentals,
[00:06:00] meaning they don't, that's not why they got their license.
[00:06:03] And so they oftentimes just overlook it.
[00:06:05] And for me, I think it is a huge mistake, especially if you're
[00:06:09] newer into the business and maybe aren't as busy as somebody
[00:06:12] who's, you know, only doing sales, you know, full time.
[00:06:15] So I think this is so perfect for that reason.
[00:06:18] And also just the state of the market right now with interest
[00:06:21] rates being where they're at every REALTOR.
[00:06:24] I talk to even the ones at the very top of the food chain
[00:06:27] seem to be stressed about next year.
[00:06:30] And I think this is so such perfect timing to talk to you.
[00:06:34] So let's talk about it.
[00:06:35] So first, I'd love to find out, I'd love to hear your origin
[00:06:39] story.
[00:06:39] How did you get to Austin?
[00:06:41] Because there's, I know there's a good story, though.
[00:06:43] So tell us why Austin and how you got into apartment locating.
[00:06:48] Yeah.
[00:06:49] I graduated from college thinking I was getting into finance.
[00:06:55] I spent two years getting rejected from every single job interview I
[00:06:59] were did over 50.
[00:07:01] I can relate to that.
[00:07:03] 
[00:07:05] And I tried a little bit of real estate in Miami and just wasn't
[00:07:09] working.
[00:07:10] And I kind of just snapped.
[00:07:13] I burned my college diplomas.
[00:07:16] And I went to Austin because it just seemed like the right place for
[00:07:21] me.
[00:07:23] I didn't know a lot of people.
[00:07:24] I had like $1,500 in the bank account.
[00:07:27] Get to Austin, get like an actual job job the first time ever.
[00:07:34] Quit that after nine months realizing I've got to be on my own.
[00:07:38] And I spend the next two years doing a bunch of random gigs.
[00:07:43] I sold cricket protein bars.
[00:07:45] I did real safe photography.
[00:07:47] I traveled to Southeast Asia on like a food travel documentary.
[00:07:52] Amazing stuff, but I come back to Austin after the trip and I'm completely broke.
[00:07:58] 
[00:07:59] And in the middle of all that I got my real estate license.
[00:08:04] And I'm like, I really don't want to be in a real estate at all.
[00:08:09] I just want like a job, have money, it's not been broke anymore.
[00:08:14] So I get into apartment locating thinking I was just going to do it for a few months.
[00:08:21] And I realized that what I'm pretty good at it, like it's actually cool work.
[00:08:29] I'm getting to be someone's like ambassador and like building those relationships.
[00:08:34] And realize how much money I could make.
[00:08:37] And given that it was Austin 2017ish and people were flooding there.
[00:08:43] I'm like, yeah.
[00:08:46] Okay, this is this is a serious opportunity.
[00:08:50] So that's how this broke and desperate detour became a business I'm still running five years later.
[00:09:00] It's amazing.
[00:09:01] And yeah, I don't know if it was just, you know, perfect timing meets perfect place meets, you know, meets hard work, which obviously you are a hard worker.
[00:09:11] I just think it's such a smart way to enter the real estate business because number one, you possibly are setting yourself up for future sales, at least a certain percentage of the people you service on the rental side could or will become buyers.
[00:09:27] Also, everyone's got to live somewhere.
[00:09:29] So if they're not buying their renting, right?
[00:09:31] So there's just so much opportunity and you're in a city that is still, I mean, years, years later, still one of the coolest, you know, as far as when you put, you know,
[00:09:40] what are the cool cities of this country?
[00:09:43] Austin's right here at the top, if not right at the top, out there with Charleston and Nashville and others kind of of its ilk.
[00:09:51] But let's, let's, so what's interesting to me is you've built this course apartment, locating mastery and I'm actually a little jealous because it is such a smart idea.
[00:10:01] And I was saying to Alexander earlier, I said, I don't know that there's another product like this out there, which by the way, if you flip that into sales mastery or, you know, being a REALTOR sales mastery, there's about a million courses and there's a lot of really good ones and trying to enter that market.
[00:10:20] I think it's a lot more difficult and trying to make a name for yourself, but you really created something that, and Alexander said, yeah, I think I think I'm the only one out there doing this.
[00:10:29] And I've really created this impressive platform and program.
[00:10:32] So I am super pumped to tell you about it.
[00:10:34] But before we get into that, maybe just for because our audiences is all over, maybe we have listeners that have never sort of done rentals.
[00:10:44] So can you just sort of go through like what is a rental look like as far as how quickly do rentals usually close, meaning, you know, you meet with the person you might show them some properties and then they sign the lease.
[00:10:56] What's the usual average time that you find that that sort of start to finish ends.
[00:11:02] And I'll agree on that.
[00:11:05] This the cycles can be a day.
[00:11:11] Yeah, it could be a year.
[00:11:14] People are just on different timelines.
[00:11:18] Someone someone could reach out to me today.
[00:11:21] I schedule them a tour for the afternoon.
[00:11:24] They close. Bam. That's it.
[00:11:26] Yeah.
[00:11:27] Or they reach out like, hey, I'm moving in January.
[00:11:33] It's got a new job.
[00:11:34] And then, oh, now it's like February or March.
[00:11:38] And then they move into an apartment like April.
[00:11:42] So I may not see that check till like the end of summer.
[00:11:45] Right.
[00:11:49] And the actual transactions themselves, if you want to get into that.
[00:11:55] And so, you know, you know, we're going to see that.
[00:11:55] And then, you know, we're going to see that.
[00:11:57] And then, you know, we're going to see that.
[00:11:57] 
[00:11:57] A really straight forward.
[00:11:58] So when I talk about apartment locating, I'm specifically referring to these big.
[00:12:06] 300, 400 professionally managed buildings.
[00:12:10] You see popping up all over the country.
[00:12:15] Those are the only buildings I work with.
[00:12:18] Because it's effectively about me system.
[00:12:23] Yeah.
[00:12:23] Where I bring someone to a building.
[00:12:27] And the per se there's spending like $2,000 on a one bedroom,
[00:12:32] which in Austin, that's pretty common.
[00:12:34] And the building pays 100% commission.
[00:12:37] And that means I'm making $2,000 for that single deal.
[00:12:42] 
[00:12:43] But I'm not touching paperwork.
[00:12:45] I'm not putting my hands on the lease on the deposit.
[00:12:50] There's no inspections, no financing.
[00:12:54] All it is in my client, putting my name down as I hate this guy referred me.
[00:13:01] And then the building pays out later.
[00:13:04] Yeah.
[00:13:06] Here in Chicago.
[00:13:06] So we have, we call it sort of there's like two buckets or two into.
[00:13:12] Two different inventories for apartments.
[00:13:15] There are what's on the MLS.
[00:13:17] And then there what I just called non MLS or, or maybe better said third,
[00:13:22] third party property management companies, which again, don't list on the MLS.
[00:13:26] These apartments, a lot of times high rises like Alexander was saying.
[00:13:31] But who do pay usually one month's rent, like you were saying as a commission,
[00:13:36] or even more sometimes depending on times of year and how much occupied,
[00:13:42] how many of the units are occupied.
[00:13:44] So it can be incredibly fast.
[00:13:47] It can be incredibly lucrative.
[00:13:49] And in a way, it's kind of nice.
[00:13:51] So the downside is that you may be competing if the building works with other agents as well.
[00:13:56] I know here in Chicago, many of the buildings, they're like,
[00:13:58] we don't really care who rents it.
[00:14:00] Just someone get this thing rented.
[00:14:02] So they'll work oftentimes with with a lot of different firms and provide that inventory to the firm.
[00:14:07] Or they'll only work with certain agents.
[00:14:09] My girlfriend works at a building.
[00:14:11] There's 500 units here in Chicago.
[00:14:13] And they only work with like three to three or four agents total out of 45,000.
[00:14:19] So it all just kind of depends.
[00:14:21] But a lot of agents don't even know that this inventory really exists because they're focused on the MLS.
[00:14:27] When they have a rental, they don't really think beyond that in a lot of markets.
[00:14:32] And there is a market for it in a lot of places.
[00:14:36] So my question is, how did you learn about about, you know, this sort of,
[00:14:41] I don't want to call it off market because it's not off market, but non MLS style of rentals.
[00:14:47] I joined the first brokerage that would.
[00:14:52] Where I can make any kind of money that I was apart from locating.
[00:15:00] And they're like, yeah, this is how it works.
[00:15:02] We work with these buildings. They pay us as much money.
[00:15:05] I'm like, oh, that's kind of cool.
[00:15:09] And I liked it because I didn't have to do like houses.
[00:15:15] Because I never wanted to be like a home, like a classic home buying and selling real estate agent.
[00:15:21] I still don't do any of those deals.
[00:15:24] But yeah, this is kind of just the, this was my point of entry into like making money real estate.
[00:15:32] So I've kind of just stayed in this niche this entire time.
[00:15:38] And I don't plan on getting into sales.
[00:15:44] What's what's nice is that, you know, you can get paid on those referrals.
[00:15:48] So if you do have renters that turn into buyers and you're like, you know, I don't really have time for that.
[00:15:53] I don't really want to do that. It's not my thing.
[00:15:55] You can still earn referral commissions, of course, by, you know, referring, which of course you already know.
[00:16:00] But I'm making that point for everyone else listening.
[00:16:03] It's like, it's not, you know, Alexander is still maintaining relationships with all of these renters.
[00:16:08] So if they want to move to another apartment at the end of their lease, he's their guy.
[00:16:12] If they want to buy a home, he's going to connect them with someone else who can assist.
[00:16:16] But, but tell us.
[00:16:18] So I want to mention one thing for anyone out there who's like, how do I get access to this inventory?
[00:16:24] Let's say they work in a brokerage that doesn't care about rentals and early due rentals.
[00:16:28] And they're like, how do I get access to this inventory?
[00:16:31] How would you suggest that people start to build this?
[00:16:34] We'll call it non-MLS inventory of apartments that, you know, that these management companies will work with you for with.
[00:16:42] Yeah. So there is like a database specifically for apartments, called smarter apartment data.
[00:16:50] And it's basically the MLS for apartments.
[00:16:55] And it's way cheaper than the MLS.
[00:16:58] I don't use the MLS.
[00:17:00] But yeah, there is a database where you could see which buildings are in my market, work, and I send referrals to what commissions do they pay.
[00:17:12] And it also functions as like at least for me the first point of research that I can send to my clients.
[00:17:21] I kind of all happens on that platform.
[00:17:24] But yeah, that's getting the inventory is pretty straightforward.
[00:17:28] Yeah, I know like the way that we built ours before services like that exist is we just called a lot of buildings and said, hey, you know, if our agents want to come rents, is that okay?
[00:17:39] And you usually have to sign some sort of agreement.
[00:17:41] But it was shockingly easy to get access to that information.
[00:17:46] And now I'm so glad to hear that there's a service that does that for you for a relatively low fee.
[00:17:52] That's incredible value.
[00:17:54] I didn't even know that existed.
[00:17:55] So I'm going to take a look at that myself.
[00:17:57] What was that called again if you don't mind me asking?
[00:17:59] Smart apartment data.
[00:18:01] Got it.
[00:18:02] So let's let's talk about apartment locating itself.
[00:18:05] We talked about like the cycle of sales cycle, the rental cycle could be as quickly as you said as an afternoon could be as long as a year depending on how, you know, when the person's moving.
[00:18:18] But let's talk about lead generation because that's always, you know, on our listeners minds is, hey, this is all great.
[00:18:26] How do I get leads now in the past years and years ago when I first started in this industry and this is going back to like 2010 or 11.
[00:18:35] There was the way that a lot of people did is they posted ads on Craigslist because it was free.
[00:18:41] It's no no longer free.
[00:18:42] I believe to do that, but it's still pretty inexpensive.
[00:18:44] I believe but it was free at the time and people would post hundreds of ads because there was a software that could do this.
[00:18:50] And I think it's maybe now transition more in a Facebook marketplace, but would love to hear the, oh, I'm sorry.
[00:18:56] So let me to complete my thought.
[00:18:58] The reason why people would post ads on Craigslist is because that was used to be the number one place people looked for apartments.
[00:19:03] And so they would reply to ads.
[00:19:05] And by the way, the buildings that Alexander is referencing oftentimes allow it's sometimes they don't sometimes they do, but they some allow you to actually promote their listings.
[00:19:15] They're open apartments.
[00:19:17] And so I don't know if that existed so much in 2017, but I'd love to hear about how you recommend people go about, you know, getting their getting the name out there and finding some leads.
[00:19:28] Yeah, just start.
[00:19:31] I started on Craigslist.
[00:19:33] Yeah, early on it worked, but Craigslist is a lot manage.
[00:19:40] But it is something you could do to start off.
[00:19:43] There are a lot of apartment rents, whole websites where you can like, yeah, you just take up buildings information, like ads with it, get leads like that.
[00:19:56] Yeah, pretty much all buildings I know.
[00:19:58] Just let you do that.
[00:20:00] Some don't.
[00:20:01] Some will ask you to take yourself now.
[00:20:02] Then you take it out.
[00:20:04] But it's knowing like all the channels you put, like those ads on and get leads like that.
[00:20:10] I mean, a lot of people do that.
[00:20:14] And a lot of people just make the ads look like how everyone else's looked like.
[00:20:19] So everyone's kind of just blending in.
[00:20:21] And the ones I would make would stand out.
[00:20:26] Yeah, it's my, I do a lot of creative writing, a lot of silly fun stuff.
[00:20:32] I've put like a business card picture on there has me and like my alpaca selfie business card picture.
[00:20:41] So yeah, what I do stands out.
[00:20:44] At all layers.
[00:20:47] But zooming out.
[00:20:50] There's a difference between what I'll describe as rented channels and owned channels.
[00:20:57] So our rented channel could be like Facebook, Google, any of these platforms to post ads, Craigslist.
[00:21:07] I don't, I don't own any of them. I don't control any of them.
[00:21:11] And for me to survive long term in this business, I didn't want to rely on channels I didn't control.
[00:21:20] If I didn't control my channels, then I didn't control my business.
[00:21:23] That's good point.
[00:21:25] So that's why early on I would, I got my own website, like professionally done for top of street.
[00:21:33] It's a brand I own.
[00:21:35] It's a website I own and control.
[00:21:37] And I knew that had to be one of my primary lead channels, because it's something I owned and control.
[00:21:45] So these days, why more than half of the deals I close come from my website.
[00:21:52] But that took a while to build.
[00:21:54] That's not something that immediately started getting traffic.
[00:21:58] But I think it's just practical to have a website day one that in my case, I got to be the face of my own business.
[00:22:07] It was my website.
[00:22:09] I can capture leads.
[00:22:11] I use really fun like lead form software.
[00:22:17] Yeah, so.
[00:22:20] I'm very pro owned channels of a rented channels.
[00:22:23] It's actually really smart because Craigslist in particular going back a ways used to be you could get away with posting 100 ads an hour.
[00:22:32] And then eventually Craigslist goes, well, that's we don't really want people doing that.
[00:22:35] And they make an algorithm change or or or just a change to their code.
[00:22:39] And all of a sudden now you can't as easily do that.
[00:22:41] All of a sudden, you know, Zillow starts charging for rental ads.
[00:22:45] These are what what Alexander saying these these rented channels.
[00:22:49] You're at the mercy of how friendly they they are feeling at that moment.
[00:22:53] And all of a sudden now Craigslist is like, oh, by the way, we're going to start charging you now for ads that used to be free.
[00:22:59] You know, and it's probably still reasonably priced, but it now it all of a sudden now changes your business.
[00:23:05] And so this idea of creating your own brand is so smart.
[00:23:08] And I really encourage everyone to go to Taco Street locating because Alexander has done such a good job of making it fun.
[00:23:15] It's a fun experience to browse this website, which by the way, if we contrast that with the average real estate agent's website.
[00:23:24] And I guess of course, Alexander is a real estate agent, but I mean somebody who's who's a more traditional sales agent.
[00:23:29] It's going to it's going to give you a different experience.
[00:23:31] I think going to your website.
[00:23:33] It's a fun experience.
[00:23:34] You get to learn about you.
[00:23:35] You get to very easily browse through inventory and and just, you know, you provide a lot of value on that website.
[00:23:41] And I think it's it's a and also it's funny.
[00:23:44] Like you have humor in there.
[00:23:45] And humor is oftentimes doesn't show up anywhere in a REALTOR website.
[00:23:50] So I love the fact that you made it fun and funny.
[00:23:54] I think that probably goes a long way with with your clients.
[00:23:57] Yeah. So one big.
[00:24:00] So again, I think of everything through a survival first framework.
[00:24:06] And from this, this tangent begins on why I don't believe competitions real.
[00:24:13] Because I'm never going head to head against another locator.
[00:24:18] Even though there's a lot of them out there, I'm never going head to head against any of them.
[00:24:21] The reality is the the quote unquote trophy is a human and they get to choose.
[00:24:28] So the risk is that I don't it's not that I lose a competition.
[00:24:32] It's that I don't get chosen.
[00:24:35] So I call that I call it like replacement risk.
[00:24:40] And I have to make myself a replaceable.
[00:24:45] So I start with that with brand.
[00:24:47] I'm the only talk with theme real say company that is.
[00:24:51] But there's a lot of content on the website.
[00:24:54] I have a lot of videos, a lot of blogs, a lot of guides, which means by the time.
[00:25:01] People get to me, they've gone through all this.
[00:25:05] And I become the only one they trust.
[00:25:09] Yeah.
[00:25:10] And by the time they get to me, they're like, hey, I've seen your videos.
[00:25:14] I've seen your content.
[00:25:16] They're like, I'm ready to go.
[00:25:18] Like, great. I've won.
[00:25:20] It's a good point because we're really talking about what is also known as social proof is sort of showing somebody your expertise.
[00:25:29] In a way that they now feel more connected to you as an individual as as somebody who, oh, I feel like I know Alexander a little bit through his writing through his videos through his fun website.
[00:25:41] But also I don't I don't have another experience to sort of compare to that because no one else has this content in this particular way.
[00:25:48] And so you're right. You're not competing with with other agents online because you're like my contents better, my sites more fun.
[00:25:56] And I'm going to provide a better service.
[00:25:58] So that's a really important point, which which really goes.
[00:26:02] I think a lot of our agents.
[00:26:04] Or a lot sorry, a lot of our listeners can really sort of go, gosh, wouldn't it be great to to have such an incredible experience for somebody that by that time they get to me.
[00:26:13] I've already been chosen, which is a pretty incredible task that you've that you've completed for them.
[00:26:21] And it goes a long way to me preserve my energy.
[00:26:27] Before my first calls would be like 25 30 minutes.
[00:26:34] And they be the same phone call every single time what service how does process works what neighborhoods you recommend what buildings do you like.
[00:26:42] And I just made videos about all of that.
[00:26:45] And just put it up front.
[00:26:47] So by the time someone gets to me, they've seen those videos.
[00:26:50] And it goes what would have been a 30 minute call is now like a 5 10 minute call.
[00:26:57] And through a survival first framework.
[00:27:00] My most important resource is my energy.
[00:27:04] Yeah. And department local it's a high volume business.
[00:27:08] To make good money, you need to work with a lot of people.
[00:27:11] And there's just a lot of mechanics.
[00:27:13] There's a lot of doing a lot.
[00:27:16] And most people I know who make it to a certain point of this business burn out.
[00:27:25] Yeah.
[00:27:25] Because even though one transaction isn't hard, 100 is if you don't have the right systems and operations.
[00:27:34] So yeah, everything is something I look at through survival first.
[00:27:41] And that's a really really good point.
[00:27:43] So I recruit REALTORS.
[00:27:44] I was thinking about this putting it through my own lens.
[00:27:46] And I have essentially a very similar conversation with every which about a half an hour like you were like your apartment locating of initial conversations.
[00:27:55] And I just realized I could be doing a better job of this as well where I could have that 30 minute sort of monologue for lack of a pitch.
[00:28:04] I guess for lack of a better word the way I do it.
[00:28:06] That could be that could be a video that I could send in advance to somebody.
[00:28:10] And maybe I wouldn't make a 30 minutes, but whatever I would make it a certain period of time where they could get the vast majority of the information.
[00:28:16] Feel like they know me a little bit.
[00:28:18] This is actually helping me in my business.
[00:28:19] So thank you for that.
[00:28:20] But I love this too because also you're branding yourself in such a way that I would assume other agents are like who don't want to deal with rentals.
[00:28:28] It's just not what they do.
[00:28:30] They're like, oh, Alexander's the guy.
[00:28:32] He's got all the cut with the best content.
[00:28:34] He's got, you know, the buildings. He knows he knows the inventory.
[00:28:37] By the way, I am curious.
[00:28:40] I'm sorry. I'm going to interrupt myself.
[00:28:42] I am curious how important knowing the inventory is as a rental agent because as a sales agent inventory is always changing for rentals.
[00:28:51] You know, there's a finite number of buildings that you probably work with.
[00:28:54] How important is it to just know those buildings in and out and everything about it?
[00:29:02] I'm going to flip this on you.
[00:29:03] Go ahead.
[00:29:04] You go to restaurant Chicago.
[00:29:07] How important is it for you that the waiter knows the menu?
[00:29:11] It's super important.
[00:29:12] Exactly.
[00:29:13] Yeah, because because I ask the waiter, hey, I'm looking through here.
[00:29:17] What are the best things I always ask that because I don't know and you're absolutely right.
[00:29:22] It's an amazing point.
[00:29:23] So the way most locators get trained is you get a few meetings with a broker, a pet on the back.
[00:29:34] Good luck. Here's some leads. Have at it.
[00:29:36] Yeah.
[00:29:38] And these people don't know the inventory.
[00:29:41] They're like people that they serve food on the menu.
[00:29:45] They just don't know what's on the menu.
[00:29:49] And that's why they're service kind of sucks.
[00:29:53] Yeah.
[00:29:55] Whereas I did the opposite and I teach the opposite in my course.
[00:29:59] It's no, you need to be an expert first.
[00:30:03] You need to go out into the market to our buildings see what's going on.
[00:30:08] So when you're talking to like prospective leads, they know you know your stuff.
[00:30:15] Yeah.
[00:30:16] I even take it a step further.
[00:30:20] I made videos where I talk about these are the buildings in the market.
[00:30:25] I love it.
[00:30:26] And people watch the videos are like this guy knows the stuff.
[00:30:30] Yeah. And all that's something.
[00:30:32] If you're starting, you could do pre fast.
[00:30:34] Yeah.
[00:30:35] You don't have to wait five years to do this.
[00:30:36] It took me years to figure out maybe I should make these videos, but that's something you could do now.
[00:30:42] Yeah.
[00:30:43] 
[00:30:43] It's a really, again, it goes back to this setting yourself up to be able to have people know that you are the expert.
[00:30:53] And having this content at the ready is like, oh, hey, you know, I'm thinking as your chat, you know, you're, you're having your initial conversation with somebody.
[00:31:02] And maybe they don't know about you yet.
[00:31:04] Maybe it's kind of a random introduction.
[00:31:05] They don't know you as the support great apartment locator and all of a sudden, you're like, okay, based on what you're doing.
[00:31:11] And what you said, there's two places that are probably the best fit.
[00:31:14] I have videos for both.
[00:31:15] I'm going to shoot them over to you so you can get a sense of what I think about it and things to learn.
[00:31:20] And all of a sudden, I mean, that is such an amazing high level of service.
[00:31:24] I guess the idea is providing the highest level of service, right?
[00:31:27] And that is an incredibly high level of service.
[00:31:30] It's not, well, here's what we're going to do.
[00:31:32] We're going to go, we're going to go see these properties, but of course, you're probably going to do that too.
[00:31:36] But you're like, before we do that, let's just make sure that you kind of like what you see.
[00:31:40] And of course, they can go to the building websites as well.
[00:31:43] But with your own spin on it and your own videos, your own content.
[00:31:47] Boy, you again, you're just branding yourself as I am the guy.
[00:31:52] And that doesn't even get into like the actual service that I'm doing.
[00:31:57] Is like the research process because I don't know if you've had to find your own apartment.
[00:32:01] It takes you a lot of time.
[00:32:02] It's a pain.
[00:32:03] Yeah, super pain.
[00:32:04] And most of the time, I guess.
[00:32:05] Yeah.
[00:32:06] And most locators take people who are very like, just like a bunch of options on this database, send it over.
[00:32:14] And there's no real value add to that.
[00:32:17] Anyone can do that.
[00:32:18] Yeah.
[00:32:18] I built a process I call the big fancy spreadsheet, which is exactly what it's out like.
[00:32:24] It's exactly what it sounds like.
[00:32:26] It's a really big detailed spreadsheet.
[00:32:28] But that takes inventory where I like, not me, my, my, my freelancers do this for me.
[00:32:35] But they will like call every single building you're interested and tell you what's available.
[00:32:39] Put all one place and organize it.
[00:32:43] And just it condenses your research process by so much.
[00:32:47] Yeah.
[00:32:48] I don't know a single locator that does anything close to that.
[00:32:53] So I know what I send that spreadsheet to someone who are like, oh,
[00:32:58] yeah, that's not, this guy's I'm messing around.
[00:33:02] Because the biggest waste of time is to tour an apartment that doesn't have what you want.
[00:33:07] Yes.
[00:33:08] For both, for both parties for the agent and for the tenant.
[00:33:11] Yeah.
[00:33:11] Yeah.
[00:33:12] It goes back to like survival first.
[00:33:14] If I'm touring, if I'm spending all my day touring places that don't have the right availability.
[00:33:19] That's wasting my time's wasting their time.
[00:33:23] So if I do all this research ahead of time, then we're not wasting any.
[00:33:31] Yeah.
[00:33:32] Yeah.
[00:33:33] It's it's a great, it's a great point.
[00:33:36] And you know, as you were talking about touring the building, I, I wanted just to mention something you said at the very beginning that I just want to make sure everyone understands.
[00:33:43] So it's like, okay, what's somebody's ready to make the decision and the way that Alexander works with with his, his, his perspective clients is by the time they're going to see a building.
[00:33:53] You, they already know this is probably the place.
[00:33:56] Maybe there's one other place, but it's going to be a short list.
[00:33:59] And here's the beauty when the person lands on the property they want.
[00:34:03] Alexander walks them down to the, to the office where if there's an on site office where there usually is for these big buildings.
[00:34:11] And says, I've got somebody and I mean that you've already been introduced to them at this point, but they, you're right, they do the paperwork.
[00:34:18] They have their own process.
[00:34:20] And you're maybe you're there to be present as they do it.
[00:34:23] But, but your jobs basically done at that point, you're just handing the person off to, to the building internal leasing agents or whatever they may have or the property management team.
[00:34:33] And they do a lot of the heavy lifting for you.
[00:34:36] Oh, yeah, I don't touch contracts.
[00:34:40] I'm not doing any of that.
[00:34:43] It's huge pain of the ass. I don't want to do it.
[00:34:46] So I don't. And that's just not part of the locating.
[00:34:50] There's the, there's still stuff.
[00:34:53] There's like invoicing, actually getting the money.
[00:34:56] That's a pain of the ass down the line.
[00:34:58] I, we have, we have 700 plus agents here.
[00:35:03] We, we know that pain. So, so what we're talking about just for anyone to know. And this is important.
[00:35:07] One of the, and I don't want to call it a con. I just want to call it something to know that if you're getting into apartment locating to be aware of.
[00:35:15] And they'll be aware of is how you get paid from these third party management companies, which not like an MLS transaction where closing agent gets the check.
[00:35:24] Everyone's happy. Everyone's paid.
[00:35:27] No, often some, some firms will do that.
[00:35:31] Some apartment locating. Sorry, some apartment companies will pay you that way.
[00:35:35] Most in my experience, as Alexander mentioned, you have to invoice.
[00:35:39] And so you have to send them an invoice saying, hey, you're basically sending them a bill.
[00:35:42] Hey, you owe me one month rent or whatever the agreement is.
[00:35:47] And then they're going to take their time to pay the bill. Some pay faster than others.
[00:35:51] Some, I know some in Chicago can pay as quick as a couple of weeks. Others take a couple of months.
[00:35:56] So that's the thing to know is that getting paid. There may be a little bit of a delay because they're not obligated to pay you the moment the person signs the lease.
[00:36:07] Yeah. And if you're not careful and go through the proper steps.
[00:36:13] A building is going to find a way to not pay you.
[00:36:16] Yeah.
[00:36:18] I've lost a lot of money.
[00:36:21] From thinking I was going to get paid on a deal to the buildings, I actually, you didn't do this small little step.
[00:36:30] So we're not going to pay you that $2,500.
[00:36:34] You thought you were getting.
[00:36:38] And yeah, I, that's part of the course of the idea, just how do you do the upfront work to make sure that you do get paid.
[00:36:45] Yeah, it's a good.
[00:36:46] Getting paid is a huge pain in the ass.
[00:36:49] Huge.
[00:36:52] My freelancer does that for me.
[00:36:54] So I don't, I don't do any of that because it's okay.
[00:36:57] Survival first.
[00:36:58] Yeah, you don't, you don't want to be chasing, you don't want to be chasing the check.
[00:37:02] Yeah.
[00:37:02] And we have a whole department here at our company that chases those checks because.
[00:37:07] And again, some management companies are wonderful and easy and others are more challenging.
[00:37:13] And, and I like some even will have rules that like, well, if the person walked into our office before they met you, Mr. Mrs. Agent, and you brought them in.
[00:37:23] Maybe they walked in, turned around, walked out, but somehow their name got put in the system.
[00:37:27] And then you now walk them in and maybe your person doesn't even tell you that they've already been there.
[00:37:33] That could, that can sometimes be a thing where a banish manager is like, well, we're not going to pay you because this person already knew about us.
[00:37:38] So there's, there's, these are important things to know about each building so that you're not, you know, wasting time or, or not getting paid.
[00:37:45] Yeah, another really important thing is the send an escort policies of a building.
[00:37:51] So in a department locating, there's either escorting a person to a building where you like go with them in person to the tour.
[00:38:00] That's called escort buildings always pay an escort.
[00:38:04] Like, they'll always pay their maximum amount on escorts.
[00:38:08] But then there's a send where you don't tour in person with the client for whatever reason.
[00:38:15] Some buildings actually pay the exact same.
[00:38:19] Both escort and send.
[00:38:21] Some buildings pay a lesser percentage, maybe like where they normally pay one month's rent, maybe on a send they pay 50%.
[00:38:33] Sometimes they don't pay anything.
[00:38:36] So that's one way to lose money is sending someone to a building that doesn't pay commission on sending tenants.
[00:38:46] I lost a lot of money that way.
[00:38:50] But that's something you should research ahead of time.
[00:38:55] But it also makes this a more depending on where you live.
[00:39:00] Different cities are have different blends.
[00:39:05] Austin is a blend of send an escort buildings.
[00:39:08] Dallas and Houston are mostly.
[00:39:11] You could send an escort at the same price, same commission and it's great.
[00:39:16] It's a big reason I'm able to do business in those markets also.
[00:39:19] So that fact makes locating really interesting as to remote operable business.
[00:39:29] So I don't know how most buildings are in Chicago.
[00:39:34] But with if you have a if you operate in or near market with a lot of buildings you could send people I had so I get paid a good amount of money.
[00:39:44] So I think you can do business in Dallas and Houston.
[00:39:49] That's incredible.
[00:39:50] Yeah.
[00:39:52] So it's a really interesting market for that reason.
[00:39:56] And on the lead gen side.
[00:39:59] You can generate a lot of home buyer leads with apartments because people who rent apartments eventually by houses.
[00:40:08] So if you're you can starting off this business apartment locating is really good long term high quality lead source.
[00:40:17] Because you've already built a relationship with a client you don't have to sell yourself again.
[00:40:23] I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss.

[00:41:45] Yeah that's true and you know you just have to remember to stay in touch after after the rental and that's something that also there's not that much competition for because we all know all of the listeners here know most most agents maybe don't do such a great job of staying in touch after a rental after a sale.
[00:42:04] I mean there's always those statistics and I never know which ones to believe but it's a certain percentage of people like three years after they buy or sell something forget the name of their REALTOR so it's not this is something that a lot of agents struggle with so if you're if you're working in the rental space and you want to eventually get those people who who transition to become buyers.
[00:42:25] You better you better do a good job of of staying in touch because you're right you've worked so hard to establish yourself as the apartment locator and you don't want that all that good well to be sort of forgotten about after after the rental.
[00:42:40] Yeah another benefit a lot of people don't think about is because of carbon locating is a higher volume business you get more contact more people.
[00:42:54] Or as nutritional sales you may do I've know what the average amount is like it doesn't maybe but it's not a lot of like human to human contact.
[00:43:04] So at the point yeah where I could do five 10 15 20 deals in a month which means I have that number of people who know me which means more referrals it means more amount.
[00:43:22] It means more rep clients in the future I've had people lease with me for five times.
[00:43:32] It's incredible they get then they send their friends to me so there's just survivors bias kind of like in any in all real estate where the longer you make it more likely you are to go into continue to make it.
[00:43:44] Right well yeah I think there's a lot of benefit to having higher volume client exposure.
[00:43:53] Especially if you're brand new yeah yeah I mean it's it's such a you just you made such this is such an important point for everyone out there who is going nobody wants to buy right now it's you know rates are at seven percent or I guess they just did drop some and now they're in the sixes but it's still higher than a lot of consumers would like.
[00:44:13] And you know but if people aren't buying their renting and yeah you're right it's a high touch.
[00:44:19] Business and you just you reach just goes really far because the transactions are typically shorter in nature so you just get to reach a lot of people and you're right more opportunity for referrals for you know for repeat business or for conversion to sales let's talk I want to talk about apartment locating mastery your course because by now I hope we've made the case that you could.
[00:44:43] Easily depending on the market now if you live in rural I don't know rural Iowa maybe this would be more of a challenge so it's not going to fit every particular market but I guess it could fit probably just about any market because there's always apartment or there's always rental opportunities but.
[00:44:59] What Alton center does is he teaches you exactly how he started the systems he's put in place you know all of the best advice he has about how to run this business even how to select brokerage because not every brokerage is super friendly to their agents doing rentals so some brokerages are kind of like they dissuade agents to do that but tell us about apartment locating mastery which by the way website apartment locating mastery dot com but tell us about the course.
[00:45:28] Yes so before there's been a limited number of options to just learn how to do the business usually the first option is to join an apartment locating specific brokerage that's going to realistically do like two or three meetings with you and here's some leads they're not really going to train you.
[00:45:56] I know people I did one of those quote unquote programs and I know dozens of agents who've gone through similar programs.
[00:46:07] It's really up to you to learn it yourself to just figure things out the hard way.
[00:46:15] And the main reason I started this course was I think you don't need to do that you don't need to go through one of these apartment locating brokerages who are going to take most of your money.
[00:46:30] I effectively paid $27,000 for my quote unquote training wow yeah because it was it was the leads I generated on my own.
[00:46:42] That was the money I paid to my broker right so he got a crazy lot of me yeah but yeah I've spent just five years really fine tuning apartment locating and I hit a point where I realized I don't want to be a locator forever but I do want to transition into training and coaching because for me.
[00:47:10] It's been such an amazing vehicle to become an entrepreneur something I never imagined being to making a good living for myself more than I ever imagined.
[00:47:24] And it's given me the sense of confidence I never imagined for myself.
[00:47:30] I've given a world where I started so it's given me someone to sovereignty and freedom where in the last five years I probably traveled the world for about one of them.
[00:47:45] And I can't imagine that having freedom in any other way and I wanted and I want to teach other people how to use this business to become the own sovereign entrepreneurs.
[00:48:05] Yeah, it's great because it gives you a lot of leverage when you are negotiating with your brokerage or when or maybe you want to open your own brokerage because I can just run it myself but this idea of what what Alexander was saying is is really common here in Chicago is that they have these apartment locating companies who really they've already curated the inventory.
[00:48:32] So they already have the inventory that you don't have to go out and kind of build on your own and and figure out that database.
[00:48:39] They've also figured out some sort of lead generation source where they're usually providing you leads.
[00:48:44] The trade-off is that your commission splits I have seen commission splits as low as like 30 35% and it's usually you know people would find that shocking but but because they can they have the inventory and the leads and they know that you can't do that on your own.
[00:49:02] I mean they you could do it on your own but they're not going to teach you how to do it on your own so they're going to take the lion share of the income and they're probably not going to train you well because you're not probably going to make a lot of money at 35% which means you're going to leave at a certain point which means they'll just keep that machine rolling with people coming and going at all times.
[00:49:19] Right.
[00:49:21] Which means if you're an independent thinking you don't want to go down that route.
[00:49:28] Yeah.
[00:49:28] You don't have to quote unquote compete against those people because they're not going to be there for that long.
[00:49:35] Yeah.
[00:49:35] And so you have these agencies or like they're big and kind of scary on the surface like that can be against them.
[00:49:43] You're not you're on your own building your own brand building your own reputation and you get to choose what brokerage you go with.
[00:49:54] For me once I once I figured out I could do all of it on my own I joined one of these one of these zero commission brokerages smart and that they're basically bring your own everything brokerage where it's on me to bring my own training my own education my own lead source all that stuff.
[00:50:17] But I could effectively running my own business inside of another brokerage.
[00:50:25] And it let me do whatever I wanted to do and no one was there to stop me.
[00:50:32] So.
[00:50:32] Yes.
[00:50:33] And we're talking and again we're keep continuing talking about sovereignty or or now people use the word agency.
[00:50:40] This idea of not to talk about working at an agency but this idea of having really so much control over your own brand, your business, your destiny that even even in the brokerage that you select we're a hundred percent firm as well.
[00:50:55] And so we have a similar model to the firm suspect that you work at and and so it's it's it's it's really nice and I love the fact that if you're an agent out there and you're worried about 20 what even if you're not worried about 2023 if you want to add just another revenue stream and you're like well not a lot of buyers these days.
[00:51:15] And so it's a very important thing to do is the sellers you know a lot of the homes are sitting sitting on the market for longer than I'd like.
[00:51:20] So even you know just having listings isn't a guaranteed sort of quick quick money as it as it was before.
[00:51:27] So things might just be sitting a lot longer add rentals in because number one like Alexander was saying high touch business you're going to expand your reach you're going to just talk to a lot of people.
[00:51:37] You're going to probably have more opportunities to you know get more referrals that way and just reach more and also again people become buyers down the road to or I always like to say the other way instead of some renters become buyers ago pretty much everyone that owns used to rent.
[00:51:53] That's I always like love that expression because it's so true and I shocked that brokerages who do take on newly licensed agents most of them don't really touch on rentals that much.
[00:52:06] And it's a little surprising because I think you know by the time and I'll by the time I was ready to buy a home I had never worked with an agent because I found my own apartments and I nobody I just didn't know that there were even people could help you find apartments so I was always finding my own apartments and by the time I needed a REALTOR I didn't have one.
[00:52:24] I didn't have one in my back pocket and meaning I didn't know anybody and I had to go wait do I know someone who's a REALTOR and then I had to find one and thankfully was my friend I was like oh yeah my friends are REALTOR.
[00:52:34] But had my friend helped me and it wasn't his he wasn't an apartment guy but had he had somebody else helped me along the way I probably wouldn't have gone with my friend not because I don't like them but because I would have felt obligated to work with the person who I've already knew like entrusted as my agent so you're absolutely right you're building that confidence and trust early on and hoping that you know that person stays with you your whole life but you were going to learn all of this stuff.
[00:53:02] By investing in a apartment locating mastery again the website apartment locating mastery.com and Alexander this is or Alexander does not just teach here's how to show apartments here's how to convert he does that to but it's really everything it's like how to deal with inventory lead gen you know converting leads into clients picking the market learning just professionalism and that's another thing in the apartment space is the people that are apartment locators sometimes professionalism and that's not the only thing that I can do is to talk about the apartment.
[00:53:32] And that's not at the top of of everyone's you know sort of value list so that's another way to separate yourself is to be this highly professional and person who's helping people with apartments and the best way to do that is through knowledge and experience and Alexander's going to teach you how to do that you know basically his his goal is zero to 10,000 a month in apartment locating so if you wanted to add anywhere from.
[00:53:55] You know a couple of deals a couple rentals a month to you know gosh 100 plus a year he's going to show you how to do it because he's done it and he is doing it so Alexander if everyone if anyone wants to learn about this and of course you do and you of course you should apartment locating mastery.com is the place and you have some bonuses to that that exists with the with the course not just how to build successful practice can you tell us a little bit about the bonuses.
[00:54:24] Yeah so i'm still working on content for the course that gets more that gets deeper into systems and operations, especially like how to use a CRM.
[00:54:40] Because it's closing one deal is easy and getting the basics down is fairly straightforward but taking that next step into closing like a hundred deals a year requires a lot more kind of operational muscle so that is going to be part of the course so the course already launched but this is going to be a supplemental bonus material.
[00:55:08] So it's going in there and yeah it's a lot I spent months building this course it's extremely detailed comprehensive and yeah it's it's good.
[00:55:22] Yeah well I encourage everyone listening look let's make 2023 the year you add another stream of income to your real estate business I mean this is a way I've always thought you know real estate's transactional of course in nature.
[00:55:37] And we want to try to smooth out the in between as much as we can in between clients in between deals rentals are a great way to say I service everyone I service the buyers the sellers the renters or partnering with somebody who does that like an Alexander like if you if you for example for everyone listening if you have a client that's moving to Austin.
[00:56:00] And once to you know find an apartment for per se you're going to refer Alexander he's the guy he is the guy you want to be if you if you want to take your business to that particular level you can be that person in your local market and I would bet there's not as much competition as there is at the top of the I want to be the top you know sales agent of you know everyone's buying for that spot rentals are often kind of forgotten about and I think it's a good thing for anyone listening because I think it's a good thing for anyone listening because I think I think I'm going to be a good thing for everyone listening to that.
[00:56:30] Because it means there's less competition and again Alexander is right and saying there really isn't competition but there's fewer players in the space I guess we could say and you know I mean Alexander's made almost a million dollars doing rentals like this is incredibly lucrative business and so you can make great money you could help people that a lot of agents would just discard oh you don't want to buy call me when you're ready to buy right that I mean I bet you have stories of renters that come to you going I reached out to an
[00:57:00] agent they basically told me to get lost they don't do rentals I mean it happens which is so shocking to me but it does happen.
[00:57:08] Yeah I get it's I get a lot of other real estate agents are like I don't know what to do with rentals I'm like I'll take them.
[00:57:18] And then I can make like two three thousand dollars never for all and the agent just didn't know how much money they just lost by like referring that to me.
[00:57:28] Yeah and it wouldn't have been like a lot of work for them if they only knew how to do very basic foundational things.
[00:57:37] Yeah.
[00:57:37] There is another really interesting point with locating that I think makes it really compelling in any market.
[00:57:46] So you probably saw a lot of market squeeze when it was got really hot or there just wasn't inventory.
[00:57:54] Yeah.
[00:57:55] That doesn't happen with apartment locating.
[00:57:58] I mean if you're like in San Francisco and you're a city this doesn't work in those markets because it just isn't inventory.
[00:58:05] But in your normal city all of which I lay out on the website.
[00:58:12] A single building has three four hundred units and you have hundreds of buildings.
[00:58:20] You're not running that out of inventory.
[00:58:23] The inventory is going to be there.
[00:58:25] As always turnover every month as well.
[00:58:27] Yeah.
[00:58:28] So the there's always going to be inventory you're never going to get market squeezed out of the business where you could be the world's best real estate agent.
[00:58:37] But if you're in a market where there's nothing to buy or sell, then it's not going to work out well for you.
[00:58:43] Yeah.
[00:58:43] This is just a great way to work with you know a changing market when maybe sales are down rentals tend to tend to go up.
[00:58:53] So this is the time to invest in a course like this apartment locating master and I'll just end with this.
[00:58:59] So I was mentioning my girlfriend works at one of these types of buildings where there's 500 units.
[00:59:03] It's like a super high end luxury building.
[00:59:06] Some of their three bedrooms not not every market's going to have this of course, but some of their three bedrooms are like $7,000.
[00:59:13] They pay a $7,000 commission if you bring them now they only work with a couple of agents.
[00:59:19] It's kind of a goofy building and that's a really extreme example not not every market has things like that.
[00:59:24] But imagine if you walked somebody into a building and you let the like my girlfriend the way that it works at her building is the agent walks in.
[00:59:32] Now they know the agents because they only work with a handful of them.
[00:59:35] My girlfriend does all the work she takes the tour the agent kind of hangs back kind of chimes in when need be.
[00:59:40] But my girlfriend's job is to sell the building.
[00:59:43] So she's leading the tour the agents kind of piping in from time to time.
[00:59:48] And then she goes down and she wants to close the sale to so or the rental.
[00:59:52] So she you know she does the hard heavy lifting.
[00:59:54] So she's leading the whole thing.
[00:59:55] You know they have quotas to hit a lot of these apartment in internal leasing agents for for these buildings.
[01:00:02] And then a $7,000 check it's written to the agent.
[01:00:05] It's in there's incredible money in this.
[01:00:09] Yeah, for me, I would say the average check is about 1500 to 2000.
[01:00:15] But I did have a deal recently where get a call the morning.
[01:00:20] And schedule tour with a client the afternoon.
[01:00:26] And he signs a $4,400 unit lease at a building paying 150% commission.
[01:00:36] Oh.
[01:00:38] It's an amazing. That's about like a $6,000 check or so.
[01:00:41] Yeah, more.
[01:00:44] That's a good days work.
[01:00:46] Yeah.
[01:00:48] So how would everyone out there like to learn to do that?
[01:00:52] So you know, Alexander's not just saying it's possible.
[01:00:54] He's like, I'm going to show you how to do it.
[01:00:56] So check out apartment locating mastery.com.
[01:01:00] Why not learn from the guy.
[01:01:01] He's the guy.
[01:01:03] And also check out his website to get hooked on him.
[01:01:06] Because what what I really want you to do, whether you invest in his course or not,
[01:01:09] I encourage you to invest in it.
[01:01:11] But even if you don't, I want you to look at how he branded himself.
[01:01:14] His, his B to C website business to consumer website is taco street locating.
[01:01:20] That's think about how well go to the website.
[01:01:22] Look at how fun it is.
[01:01:24] He made a really arduous process, stressful process.
[01:01:29] Traditionally not a super fun process.
[01:01:31] He made it fun.
[01:01:32] And that in and of itself is brilliant.
[01:01:35] He's going to teach you how to do these kind of things and build this side business.
[01:01:39] Maybe by the way, maybe you're still like, I don't want to be an apartment.
[01:01:42] I don't want to do a part of rentals.
[01:01:43] Well, maybe you could bring on a team member and they could be the apartment with a rental person and you be the sales person.
[01:01:49] So it's not like even if this doesn't affect you or maybe you're a team you don't really have somebody doing rentals.
[01:01:54] Oh my gosh, there's so much opportunity here.
[01:01:57] So 2023, we know it's going to be tough on the sales side.
[01:02:00] We just know that I wish it wasn't, but it's going to be rentals are where it's at.
[01:02:05] So apartment locating mastery.com is where you can learn about the course taco street locating is Alexander's website.
[01:02:11] To see how he services his clients, the content he provides.
[01:02:15] So that by the time they actually get to him, they're like, he's my guy.
[01:02:18] And he hasn't even met them yet.
[01:02:20] That's an amazing thing to have happen.
[01:02:23] And Alexander, we're so grateful that you came on the show to talk about this.

And on to my conversation, which is really the episode, of Alex Concepcion. [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ [♪ OUTRO MUSIC PLAYING [♪ Today on this show is Alexander Concepcion from Daco Street, locating, serving Austin, Houston, and Dallas. Let me tell you more about Alexander. Now, Alexander is a Cuban American born and raised in Miami, Florida. He moved to Austin to chase riches and tacos. After trying a bunch of random gigs going broke, he stumbled into apartment location services and created Taco Street, locating. Now, after more than 400 deals and 700,000 in revenue, he's becoming one of the most successful independent apartment locators in Texas, probably in the country, not just Texas. When he's not locating, he's working on a book that he's writing. He's also being a low budget Anthony Bourdain. That's not the book. That's a, uh, Hama being a low budget Anthony Bourdain, cooking, playing disc golf, and also working out. I have two websites I want everybody to check out. First, just to see what Alex and her is all about, Taco Street locating is his apartment, locating service. But he also teaches and we were just chatting about this beforehand. We believe the first and maybe only course out there for agents to learn how to do apartment locating. So the best way to learn about this course and we're going to talk about it today, visit the website apartment locating mastery.com. By the way, both of those links are in the show notes. So just scroll to the show notes. Click on a particular apartment locating mastery to see his course. Alexander, I keep wanting to call you Alex because I have a very close friend named Alex. So I apologize. I might stumble over that here. But anyway, Alexander, welcome to the show. Thank you. Yeah, I used to go by Alex, but I switched to Alexander this year because it's my actual full name and I just like it more. So there's just a lot, there's lots of Alexander. So I'm like, I'm going with it. Mine. I like it. I think there's some names that sound better shortened. And I think Alexander is not one of those names. I like it better. It sort of works all the way through. No, my name is a nickname. So I'm sort of not one to talk. But my name is actually, it's a Spanish name. It doesn't, I'm not from any sort of Spanish speaking country. But my name is Delphin is the D and J is walking. So and I don't look particularly Spanish. I don't think so. I DJs just a heck of a lot easier for people to absorb. But anyway, we're not here to talk about my name. But I'm so excited to have you because this came at just a perfect time. So we have to give you a little background. So right now, you know, by the time you're listening to this, it's probably mid December and Alexander and I recording this late late November, just actually a few days before Thanksgiving. And we have about, well, the two, I don't know, between seven and 800 agents here at our company. And we do mostly sales and we've tried over the years to really introduce our brokers, by the way, in Illinois, every REALTOR is called a broker. So I know that's not the way it is in every state. So I'll just say REALTOR. But we tried to take to really encourage our REALTOR's in between sales to do some, do some rentals because specifically here in Chicago, obviously, big rental market and lots of money to be had. Most agents, however, don't get their license to do rentals, meaning they don't, that's not why they got their license. And so they oftentimes just overlook it. And for me, I think it is a huge mistake, especially if you're newer into the business and maybe aren't as busy as somebody who's, you know, only doing sales, you know, full time. So I think this is so perfect for that reason. And also just the state of the market right now with interest rates being where they're at every REALTOR. I talk to even the ones at the very top of the food chain seem to be stressed about next year. And I think this is so such perfect timing to talk to you. So let's talk about it. So first, I'd love to find out, I'd love to hear your origin story. How did you get to Austin? Because there's, I know there's a good story, though. So tell us why Austin and how you got into apartment locating. Yeah. I graduated from college thinking I was getting into finance. I spent two years getting rejected from every single job interview I were did over 50. I can relate to that. And I tried a little bit of real estate in Miami and just wasn't working. And I kind of just snapped. I burned my college diplomas. And I went to Austin because it just seemed like the right place for me. I didn't know a lot of people. I had like $1,500 in the bank account. Get to Austin, get like an actual job job the first time ever. Quit that after nine months realizing I've got to be on my own. And I spend the next two years doing a bunch of random gigs. I sold cricket protein bars. I did real safe photography. I traveled to Southeast Asia on like a food travel documentary. Amazing stuff, but I come back to Austin after the trip and I'm completely broke. And in the middle of all that I got my real estate license. And I'm like, I really don't want to be in a real estate at all. I just want like a job, have money, it's not been broke anymore. So I get into apartment locating thinking I was just going to do it for a few months. And I realized that what I'm pretty good at it, like it's actually cool work. I'm getting to be someone's like ambassador and like building those relationships. And realize how much money I could make. And given that it was Austin 2017ish and people were flooding there. I'm like, yeah. Okay, this is this is a serious opportunity. So that's how this broke and desperate detour became a business I'm still running five years later. It's amazing. And yeah, I don't know if it was just, you know, perfect timing meets perfect place meets, you know, meets hard work, which obviously you are a hard worker. I just think it's such a smart way to enter the real estate business because number one, you possibly are setting yourself up for future sales, at least a certain percentage of the people you service on the rental side could or will become buyers. Also, everyone's got to live somewhere. So if they're not buying their renting, right? So there's just so much opportunity and you're in a city that is still, I mean, years, years later, still one of the coolest, you know, as far as when you put, you know, what are the cool cities of this country? Austin's right here at the top, if not right at the top, out there with Charleston and Nashville and others kind of of its ilk. But let's, let's, so what's interesting to me is you've built this course apartment, locating mastery and I'm actually a little jealous because it is such a smart idea. And I was saying to Alexander earlier, I said, I don't know that there's another product like this out there, which by the way, if you flip that into sales mastery or, you know, being a REALTOR sales mastery, there's about a million courses and there's a lot of really good ones and trying to enter that market. I think it's a lot more difficult and trying to make a name for yourself, but you really created something that, and Alexander said, yeah, I think I think I'm the only one out there doing this. And I've really created this impressive platform and program. So I am super pumped to tell you about it. But before we get into that, maybe just for because our audiences is all over, maybe we have listeners that have never sort of done rentals. So can you just sort of go through like what is a rental look like as far as how quickly do rentals usually close, meaning, you know, you meet with the person you might show them some properties and then they sign the lease. What's the usual average time that you find that that sort of start to finish ends. And I'll agree on that. This the cycles can be a day. Yeah, it could be a year. People are just on different timelines. Someone someone could reach out to me today. I schedule them a tour for the afternoon. They close. Bam. That's it. Yeah. Or they reach out like, hey, I'm moving in January. It's got a new job. And then, oh, now it's like February or March. And then they move into an apartment like April. So I may not see that check till like the end of summer. Right. And the actual transactions themselves, if you want to get into that. And so, you know, you know, we're going to see that. And then, you know, we're going to see that. And then, you know, we're going to see that. A really straight forward. So when I talk about apartment locating, I'm specifically referring to these big. 300, 400 professionally managed buildings. You see popping up all over the country. Those are the only buildings I work with. Because it's effectively about me system. Yeah. Where I bring someone to a building. And the per se there's spending like $2,000 on a one bedroom, which in Austin, that's pretty common. And the building pays 100% commission. And that means I'm making $2,000 for that single deal. But I'm not touching paperwork. I'm not putting my hands on the lease on the deposit. There's no inspections, no financing. All it is in my client, putting my name down as I hate this guy referred me. And then the building pays out later. Yeah. Here in Chicago. So we have, we call it sort of there's like two buckets or two into. Two different inventories for apartments. There are what's on the MLS. And then there what I just called non MLS or, or maybe better said third, third party property management companies, which again, don't list on the MLS. These apartments, a lot of times high rises like Alexander was saying. But who do pay usually one month's rent, like you were saying as a commission, or even more sometimes depending on times of year and how much occupied, how many of the units are occupied. So it can be incredibly fast. It can be incredibly lucrative. And in a way, it's kind of nice. So the downside is that you may be competing if the building works with other agents as well. I know here in Chicago, many of the buildings, they're like, we don't really care who rents it. Just someone get this thing rented. So they'll work oftentimes with with a lot of different firms and provide that inventory to the firm. Or they'll only work with certain agents. My girlfriend works at a building. There's 500 units here in Chicago. And they only work with like three to three or four agents total out of 45,000. So it all just kind of depends. But a lot of agents don't even know that this inventory really exists because they're focused on the MLS. When they have a rental, they don't really think beyond that in a lot of markets. And there is a market for it in a lot of places. So my question is, how did you learn about about, you know, this sort of, I don't want to call it off market because it's not off market, but non MLS style of rentals. I joined the first brokerage that would. Where I can make any kind of money that I was apart from locating. And they're like, yeah, this is how it works. We work with these buildings. They pay us as much money. I'm like, oh, that's kind of cool. And I liked it because I didn't have to do like houses. Because I never wanted to be like a home, like a classic home buying and selling real estate agent. I still don't do any of those deals. But yeah, this is kind of just the, this was my point of entry into like making money real estate. So I've kind of just stayed in this niche this entire time. And I don't plan on getting into sales. What's what's nice is that, you know, you can get paid on those referrals. So if you do have renters that turn into buyers and you're like, you know, I don't really have time for that. I don't really want to do that. It's not my thing. You can still earn referral commissions, of course, by, you know, referring, which of course you already know. But I'm making that point for everyone else listening. It's like, it's not, you know, Alexander is still maintaining relationships with all of these renters. So if they want to move to another apartment at the end of their lease, he's their guy. If they want to buy a home, he's going to connect them with someone else who can assist. But, but tell us. So I want to mention one thing for anyone out there who's like, how do I get access to this inventory? Let's say they work in a brokerage that doesn't care about rentals and early due rentals. And they're like, how do I get access to this inventory? How would you suggest that people start to build this? We'll call it non-MLS inventory of apartments that, you know, that these management companies will work with you for with. Yeah. So there is like a database specifically for apartments, called smarter apartment data. And it's basically the MLS for apartments. And it's way cheaper than the MLS. I don't use the MLS. But yeah, there is a database where you could see which buildings are in my market, work, and I send referrals to what commissions do they pay. And it also functions as like at least for me the first point of research that I can send to my clients. I kind of all happens on that platform. But yeah, that's getting the inventory is pretty straightforward. Yeah, I know like the way that we built ours before services like that exist is we just called a lot of buildings and said, hey, you know, if our agents want to come rents, is that okay? And you usually have to sign some sort of agreement. But it was shockingly easy to get access to that information. And now I'm so glad to hear that there's a service that does that for you for a relatively low fee. That's incredible value. I didn't even know that existed. So I'm going to take a look at that myself. What was that called again if you don't mind me asking? Smart apartment data. Got it. So let's let's talk about apartment locating itself. We talked about like the cycle of sales cycle, the rental cycle could be as quickly as you said as an afternoon could be as long as a year depending on how, you know, when the person's moving. But let's talk about lead generation because that's always, you know, on our listeners minds is, hey, this is all great. How do I get leads now in the past years and years ago when I first started in this industry and this is going back to like 2010 or 11. There was the way that a lot of people did is they posted ads on Craigslist because it was free. It's no no longer free. I believe to do that, but it's still pretty inexpensive. I believe but it was free at the time and people would post hundreds of ads because there was a software that could do this. And I think it's maybe now transition more in a Facebook marketplace, but would love to hear the, oh, I'm sorry. So let me to complete my thought. The reason why people would post ads on Craigslist is because that was used to be the number one place people looked for apartments. And so they would reply to ads. And by the way, the buildings that Alexander is referencing oftentimes allow it's sometimes they don't sometimes they do, but they some allow you to actually promote their listings. They're open apartments. And so I don't know if that existed so much in 2017, but I'd love to hear about how you recommend people go about, you know, getting their getting the name out there and finding some leads. Yeah, just start. I started on Craigslist. Yeah, early on it worked, but Craigslist is a lot manage. But it is something you could do to start off. There are a lot of apartment rents, whole websites where you can like, yeah, you just take up buildings information, like ads with it, get leads like that. Yeah, pretty much all buildings I know. Just let you do that. Some don't. Some will ask you to take yourself now. Then you take it out. But it's knowing like all the channels you put, like those ads on and get leads like that. I mean, a lot of people do that. And a lot of people just make the ads look like how everyone else's looked like. So everyone's kind of just blending in. And the ones I would make would stand out. Yeah, it's my, I do a lot of creative writing, a lot of silly fun stuff. I've put like a business card picture on there has me and like my alpaca selfie business card picture. So yeah, what I do stands out. At all layers. But zooming out. There's a difference between what I'll describe as rented channels and owned channels. So our rented channel could be like Facebook, Google, any of these platforms to post ads, Craigslist. I don't, I don't own any of them. I don't control any of them. And for me to survive long term in this business, I didn't want to rely on channels I didn't control. If I didn't control my channels, then I didn't control my business. That's good point. So that's why early on I would, I got my own website, like professionally done for top of street. It's a brand I own. It's a website I own and control. And I knew that had to be one of my primary lead channels, because it's something I owned and control. So these days, why more than half of the deals I close come from my website. But that took a while to build. That's not something that immediately started getting traffic. But I think it's just practical to have a website day one that in my case, I got to be the face of my own business. It was my website. I can capture leads. I use really fun like lead form software. Yeah, so. I'm very pro owned channels of a rented channels. It's actually really smart because Craigslist in particular going back a ways used to be you could get away with posting 100 ads an hour. And then eventually Craigslist goes, well, that's we don't really want people doing that. And they make an algorithm change or or or just a change to their code. And all of a sudden now you can't as easily do that. All of a sudden, you know, Zillow starts charging for rental ads. These are what what Alexander saying these these rented channels. You're at the mercy of how friendly they they are feeling at that moment. And all of a sudden now Craigslist is like, oh, by the way, we're going to start charging you now for ads that used to be free. You know, and it's probably still reasonably priced, but it now it all of a sudden now changes your business. And so this idea of creating your own brand is so smart. And I really encourage everyone to go to Taco Street locating because Alexander has done such a good job of making it fun. It's a fun experience to browse this website, which by the way, if we contrast that with the average real estate agent's website. And I guess of course, Alexander is a real estate agent, but I mean somebody who's who's a more traditional sales agent. It's going to it's going to give you a different experience. I think going to your website. It's a fun experience. You get to learn about you. You get to very easily browse through inventory and and just, you know, you provide a lot of value on that website. And I think it's it's a and also it's funny. Like you have humor in there. And humor is oftentimes doesn't show up anywhere in a REALTOR website. So I love the fact that you made it fun and funny. I think that probably goes a long way with with your clients. Yeah. So one big. So again, I think of everything through a survival first framework. And from this, this tangent begins on why I don't believe competitions real. Because I'm never going head to head against another locator. Even though there's a lot of them out there, I'm never going head to head against any of them. The reality is the the quote unquote trophy is a human and they get to choose. So the risk is that I don't it's not that I lose a competition. It's that I don't get chosen. So I call that I call it like replacement risk. And I have to make myself a replaceable. So I start with that with brand. I'm the only talk with theme real say company that is. But there's a lot of content on the website. I have a lot of videos, a lot of blogs, a lot of guides, which means by the time. People get to me, they've gone through all this. And I become the only one they trust. Yeah. And by the time they get to me, they're like, hey, I've seen your videos. I've seen your content. They're like, I'm ready to go. Like, great. I've won. It's a good point because we're really talking about what is also known as social proof is sort of showing somebody your expertise. In a way that they now feel more connected to you as an individual as as somebody who, oh, I feel like I know Alexander a little bit through his writing through his videos through his fun website. But also I don't I don't have another experience to sort of compare to that because no one else has this content in this particular way. And so you're right. You're not competing with with other agents online because you're like my contents better, my sites more fun. And I'm going to provide a better service. So that's a really important point, which which really goes. I think a lot of our agents. Or a lot sorry, a lot of our listeners can really sort of go, gosh, wouldn't it be great to to have such an incredible experience for somebody that by that time they get to me. I've already been chosen, which is a pretty incredible task that you've that you've completed for them. And it goes a long way to me preserve my energy. Before my first calls would be like 25 30 minutes. And they be the same phone call every single time what service how does process works what neighborhoods you recommend what buildings do you like. And I just made videos about all of that. And just put it up front. So by the time someone gets to me, they've seen those videos. And it goes what would have been a 30 minute call is now like a 5 10 minute call. And through a survival first framework. My most important resource is my energy. Yeah. And department local it's a high volume business. To make good money, you need to work with a lot of people. And there's just a lot of mechanics. There's a lot of doing a lot. And most people I know who make it to a certain point of this business burn out. Yeah. Because even though one transaction isn't hard, 100 is if you don't have the right systems and operations. So yeah, everything is something I look at through survival first. And that's a really really good point. So I recruit REALTORS. I was thinking about this putting it through my own lens. And I have essentially a very similar conversation with every which about a half an hour like you were like your apartment locating of initial conversations. And I just realized I could be doing a better job of this as well where I could have that 30 minute sort of monologue for lack of a pitch. I guess for lack of a better word the way I do it. That could be that could be a video that I could send in advance to somebody. And maybe I wouldn't make a 30 minutes, but whatever I would make it a certain period of time where they could get the vast majority of the information. Feel like they know me a little bit. This is actually helping me in my business. So thank you for that. But I love this too because also you're branding yourself in such a way that I would assume other agents are like who don't want to deal with rentals. It's just not what they do. They're like, oh, Alexander's the guy. He's got all the cut with the best content. He's got, you know, the buildings. He knows he knows the inventory. By the way, I am curious. I'm sorry. I'm going to interrupt myself. I am curious how important knowing the inventory is as a rental agent because as a sales agent inventory is always changing for rentals. You know, there's a finite number of buildings that you probably work with. How important is it to just know those buildings in and out and everything about it? I'm going to flip this on you. Go ahead. You go to restaurant Chicago. How important is it for you that the waiter knows the menu? It's super important. Exactly. Yeah, because because I ask the waiter, hey, I'm looking through here. What are the best things I always ask that because I don't know and you're absolutely right. It's an amazing point. So the way most locators get trained is you get a few meetings with a broker, a pet on the back. Good luck. Here's some leads. Have at it. Yeah. And these people don't know the inventory. They're like people that they serve food on the menu. They just don't know what's on the menu. And that's why they're service kind of sucks. Yeah. Whereas I did the opposite and I teach the opposite in my course. It's no, you need to be an expert first. You need to go out into the market to our buildings see what's going on. So when you're talking to like prospective leads, they know you know your stuff. Yeah. I even take it a step further. I made videos where I talk about these are the buildings in the market. I love it. And people watch the videos are like this guy knows the stuff. Yeah. And all that's something. If you're starting, you could do pre fast. Yeah. You don't have to wait five years to do this. It took me years to figure out maybe I should make these videos, but that's something you could do now. Yeah. It's a really, again, it goes back to this setting yourself up to be able to have people know that you are the expert. And having this content at the ready is like, oh, hey, you know, I'm thinking as your chat, you know, you're, you're having your initial conversation with somebody. And maybe they don't know about you yet. Maybe it's kind of a random introduction. They don't know you as the support great apartment locator and all of a sudden, you're like, okay, based on what you're doing. And what you said, there's two places that are probably the best fit. I have videos for both. I'm going to shoot them over to you so you can get a sense of what I think about it and things to learn. And all of a sudden, I mean, that is such an amazing high level of service. I guess the idea is providing the highest level of service, right? And that is an incredibly high level of service. It's not, well, here's what we're going to do. We're going to go, we're going to go see these properties, but of course, you're probably going to do that too. But you're like, before we do that, let's just make sure that you kind of like what you see. And of course, they can go to the building websites as well. But with your own spin on it and your own videos, your own content. Boy, you again, you're just branding yourself as I am the guy. And that doesn't even get into like the actual service that I'm doing. Is like the research process because I don't know if you've had to find your own apartment. It takes you a lot of time. It's a pain. Yeah, super pain. And most of the time, I guess. Yeah. And most locators take people who are very like, just like a bunch of options on this database, send it over. And there's no real value add to that. Anyone can do that. Yeah. I built a process I call the big fancy spreadsheet, which is exactly what it's out like. It's exactly what it sounds like. It's a really big detailed spreadsheet. But that takes inventory where I like, not me, my, my, my freelancers do this for me. But they will like call every single building you're interested and tell you what's available. Put all one place and organize it. And just it condenses your research process by so much. Yeah. I don't know a single locator that does anything close to that. So I know what I send that spreadsheet to someone who are like, oh, yeah, that's not, this guy's I'm messing around. Because the biggest waste of time is to tour an apartment that doesn't have what you want. Yes. For both, for both parties for the agent and for the tenant. Yeah. Yeah. It goes back to like survival first. If I'm touring, if I'm spending all my day touring places that don't have the right availability. That's wasting my time's wasting their time. So if I do all this research ahead of time, then we're not wasting any. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's a great, it's a great point. And you know, as you were talking about touring the building, I, I wanted just to mention something you said at the very beginning that I just want to make sure everyone understands. So it's like, okay, what's somebody's ready to make the decision and the way that Alexander works with with his, his, his perspective clients is by the time they're going to see a building. You, they already know this is probably the place. Maybe there's one other place, but it's going to be a short list. And here's the beauty when the person lands on the property they want. Alexander walks them down to the, to the office where if there's an on site office where there usually is for these big buildings. And says, I've got somebody and I mean that you've already been introduced to them at this point, but they, you're right, they do the paperwork. They have their own process. And you're maybe you're there to be present as they do it. But, but your jobs basically done at that point, you're just handing the person off to, to the building internal leasing agents or whatever they may have or the property management team. And they do a lot of the heavy lifting for you. Oh, yeah, I don't touch contracts. I'm not doing any of that. It's huge pain of the ass. I don't want to do it. So I don't. And that's just not part of the locating. There's the, there's still stuff. There's like invoicing, actually getting the money. That's a pain of the ass down the line. I, we have, we have 700 plus agents here. We, we know that pain. So, so what we're talking about just for anyone to know. And this is important. One of the, and I don't want to call it a con. I just want to call it something to know that if you're getting into apartment locating to be aware of. And they'll be aware of is how you get paid from these third party management companies, which not like an MLS transaction where closing agent gets the check. Everyone's happy. Everyone's paid. No, often some, some firms will do that. Some apartment locating. Sorry, some apartment companies will pay you that way. Most in my experience, as Alexander mentioned, you have to invoice. And so you have to send them an invoice saying, hey, you're basically sending them a bill. Hey, you owe me one month rent or whatever the agreement is. And then they're going to take their time to pay the bill. Some pay faster than others. Some, I know some in Chicago can pay as quick as a couple of weeks. Others take a couple of months. So that's the thing to know is that getting paid. There may be a little bit of a delay because they're not obligated to pay you the moment the person signs the lease. Yeah. And if you're not careful and go through the proper steps. A building is going to find a way to not pay you. Yeah. I've lost a lot of money. From thinking I was going to get paid on a deal to the buildings, I actually, you didn't do this small little step. So we're not going to pay you that $2,500. You thought you were getting. And yeah, I, that's part of the course of the idea, just how do you do the upfront work to make sure that you do get paid. Yeah, it's a good. Getting paid is a huge pain in the ass. Huge. My freelancer does that for me. So I don't, I don't do any of that because it's okay. Survival first. Yeah, you don't, you don't want to be chasing, you don't want to be chasing the check. Yeah. And we have a whole department here at our company that chases those checks because. And again, some management companies are wonderful and easy and others are more challenging. And, and I like some even will have rules that like, well, if the person walked into our office before they met you, Mr. Mrs. Agent, and you brought them in. Maybe they walked in, turned around, walked out, but somehow their name got put in the system. And then you now walk them in and maybe your person doesn't even tell you that they've already been there. That could, that can sometimes be a thing where a banish manager is like, well, we're not going to pay you because this person already knew about us. So there's, there's, these are important things to know about each building so that you're not, you know, wasting time or, or not getting paid. Yeah, another really important thing is the send an escort policies of a building. So in a department locating, there's either escorting a person to a building where you like go with them in person to the tour. That's called escort buildings always pay an escort. Like, they'll always pay their maximum amount on escorts. But then there's a send where you don't tour in person with the client for whatever reason. Some buildings actually pay the exact same. Both escort and send. Some buildings pay a lesser percentage, maybe like where they normally pay one month's rent, maybe on a send they pay 50%. Sometimes they don't pay anything. So that's one way to lose money is sending someone to a building that doesn't pay commission on sending tenants. I lost a lot of money that way. But that's something you should research ahead of time. But it also makes this a more depending on where you live. Different cities are have different blends. Austin is a blend of send an escort buildings. Dallas and Houston are mostly. You could send an escort at the same price, same commission and it's great. It's a big reason I'm able to do business in those markets also. So that fact makes locating really interesting as to remote operable business. So I don't know how most buildings are in Chicago. But with if you have a if you operate in or near market with a lot of buildings you could send people I had so I get paid a good amount of money. So I think you can do business in Dallas and Houston. That's incredible. Yeah. So it's a really interesting market for that reason. And on the lead gen side. You can generate a lot of home buyer leads with apartments because people who rent apartments eventually by houses. So if you're you can starting off this business apartment locating is really good long term high quality lead source. Because you've already built a relationship with a client you don't have to sell yourself again.

Yeah that's true and you know you just have to remember to stay in touch after after the rental and that's something that also there's not that much competition for because we all know all of the listeners here know most most agents maybe don't do such a great job of staying in touch after a rental after a sale. I mean there's always those statistics and I never know which ones to believe but it's a certain percentage of people like three years after they buy or sell something forget the name of their REALTOR so it's not this is something that a lot of agents struggle with so if you're if you're working in the rental space and you want to eventually get those people who who transition to become buyers. You better you better do a good job of of staying in touch because you're right you've worked so hard to establish yourself as the apartment locator and you don't want that all that good well to be sort of forgotten about after after the rental. Yeah another benefit a lot of people don't think about is because of carbon locating is a higher volume business you get more contact more people. Or as nutritional sales you may do I've know what the average amount is like it doesn't maybe but it's not a lot of like human to human contact. So at the point yeah where I could do five 10 15 20 deals in a month which means I have that number of people who know me which means more referrals it means more amount. It means more rep clients in the future I've had people lease with me for five times. It's incredible they get then they send their friends to me so there's just survivors bias kind of like in any in all real estate where the longer you make it more likely you are to go into continue to make it. Right well yeah I think there's a lot of benefit to having higher volume client exposure. Especially if you're brand new yeah yeah I mean it's it's such a you just you made such this is such an important point for everyone out there who is going nobody wants to buy right now it's you know rates are at seven percent or I guess they just did drop some and now they're in the sixes but it's still higher than a lot of consumers would like. And you know but if people aren't buying their renting and yeah you're right it's a high touch. Business and you just you reach just goes really far because the transactions are typically shorter in nature so you just get to reach a lot of people and you're right more opportunity for referrals for you know for repeat business or for conversion to sales let's talk I want to talk about apartment locating mastery your course because by now I hope we've made the case that you could. Easily depending on the market now if you live in rural I don't know rural Iowa maybe this would be more of a challenge so it's not going to fit every particular market but I guess it could fit probably just about any market because there's always apartment or there's always rental opportunities but. What Alton center does is he teaches you exactly how he started the systems he's put in place you know all of the best advice he has about how to run this business even how to select brokerage because not every brokerage is super friendly to their agents doing rentals so some brokerages are kind of like they dissuade agents to do that but tell us about apartment locating mastery which by the way website apartment locating mastery dot com but tell us about the course. Yes so before there's been a limited number of options to just learn how to do the business usually the first option is to join an apartment locating specific brokerage that's going to realistically do like two or three meetings with you and here's some leads they're not really going to train you. I know people I did one of those quote unquote programs and I know dozens of agents who've gone through similar programs. It's really up to you to learn it yourself to just figure things out the hard way. And the main reason I started this course was I think you don't need to do that you don't need to go through one of these apartment locating brokerages who are going to take most of your money. I effectively paid $27,000 for my quote unquote training wow yeah because it was it was the leads I generated on my own. That was the money I paid to my broker right so he got a crazy lot of me yeah but yeah I've spent just five years really fine tuning apartment locating and I hit a point where I realized I don't want to be a locator forever but I do want to transition into training and coaching because for me. It's been such an amazing vehicle to become an entrepreneur something I never imagined being to making a good living for myself more than I ever imagined. And it's given me the sense of confidence I never imagined for myself. I've given a world where I started so it's given me someone to sovereignty and freedom where in the last five years I probably traveled the world for about one of them. And I can't imagine that having freedom in any other way and I wanted and I want to teach other people how to use this business to become the own sovereign entrepreneurs. Yeah, it's great because it gives you a lot of leverage when you are negotiating with your brokerage or when or maybe you want to open your own brokerage because I can just run it myself but this idea of what what Alexander was saying is is really common here in Chicago is that they have these apartment locating companies who really they've already curated the inventory. So they already have the inventory that you don't have to go out and kind of build on your own and and figure out that database. They've also figured out some sort of lead generation source where they're usually providing you leads. The trade-off is that your commission splits I have seen commission splits as low as like 30 35% and it's usually you know people would find that shocking but but because they can they have the inventory and the leads and they know that you can't do that on your own. I mean they you could do it on your own but they're not going to teach you how to do it on your own so they're going to take the lion share of the income and they're probably not going to train you well because you're not probably going to make a lot of money at 35% which means you're going to leave at a certain point which means they'll just keep that machine rolling with people coming and going at all times. Right. Which means if you're an independent thinking you don't want to go down that route. Yeah. You don't have to quote unquote compete against those people because they're not going to be there for that long. Yeah. And so you have these agencies or like they're big and kind of scary on the surface like that can be against them. You're not you're on your own building your own brand building your own reputation and you get to choose what brokerage you go with. For me once I once I figured out I could do all of it on my own I joined one of these one of these zero commission brokerages smart and that they're basically bring your own everything brokerage where it's on me to bring my own training my own education my own lead source all that stuff. But I could effectively running my own business inside of another brokerage. And it let me do whatever I wanted to do and no one was there to stop me. So. Yes. And we're talking and again we're keep continuing talking about sovereignty or or now people use the word agency. This idea of not to talk about working at an agency but this idea of having really so much control over your own brand, your business, your destiny that even even in the brokerage that you select we're a hundred percent firm as well. And so we have a similar model to the firm suspect that you work at and and so it's it's it's it's really nice and I love the fact that if you're an agent out there and you're worried about 20 what even if you're not worried about 2023 if you want to add just another revenue stream and you're like well not a lot of buyers these days. And so it's a very important thing to do is the sellers you know a lot of the homes are sitting sitting on the market for longer than I'd like. So even you know just having listings isn't a guaranteed sort of quick quick money as it as it was before. So things might just be sitting a lot longer add rentals in because number one like Alexander was saying high touch business you're going to expand your reach you're going to just talk to a lot of people. You're going to probably have more opportunities to you know get more referrals that way and just reach more and also again people become buyers down the road to or I always like to say the other way instead of some renters become buyers ago pretty much everyone that owns used to rent. That's I always like love that expression because it's so true and I shocked that brokerages who do take on newly licensed agents most of them don't really touch on rentals that much. And it's a little surprising because I think you know by the time and I'll by the time I was ready to buy a home I had never worked with an agent because I found my own apartments and I nobody I just didn't know that there were even people could help you find apartments so I was always finding my own apartments and by the time I needed a REALTOR I didn't have one. I didn't have one in my back pocket and meaning I didn't know anybody and I had to go wait do I know someone who's a REALTOR and then I had to find one and thankfully was my friend I was like oh yeah my friends are REALTOR. But had my friend helped me and it wasn't his he wasn't an apartment guy but had he had somebody else helped me along the way I probably wouldn't have gone with my friend not because I don't like them but because I would have felt obligated to work with the person who I've already knew like entrusted as my agent so you're absolutely right you're building that confidence and trust early on and hoping that you know that person stays with you your whole life but you were going to learn all of this stuff. By investing in a apartment locating mastery again the website apartment locating mastery.com and Alexander this is or Alexander does not just teach here's how to show apartments here's how to convert he does that to but it's really everything it's like how to deal with inventory lead gen you know converting leads into clients picking the market learning just professionalism and that's another thing in the apartment space is the people that are apartment locators sometimes professionalism and that's not the only thing that I can do is to talk about the apartment. And that's not at the top of of everyone's you know sort of value list so that's another way to separate yourself is to be this highly professional and person who's helping people with apartments and the best way to do that is through knowledge and experience and Alexander's going to teach you how to do that you know basically his his goal is zero to 10,000 a month in apartment locating so if you wanted to add anywhere from. You know a couple of deals a couple rentals a month to you know gosh 100 plus a year he's going to show you how to do it because he's done it and he is doing it so Alexander if everyone if anyone wants to learn about this and of course you do and you of course you should apartment locating mastery.com is the place and you have some bonuses to that that exists with the with the course not just how to build successful practice can you tell us a little bit about the bonuses. Yeah so i'm still working on content for the course that gets more that gets deeper into systems and operations, especially like how to use a CRM. Because it's closing one deal is easy and getting the basics down is fairly straightforward but taking that next step into closing like a hundred deals a year requires a lot more kind of operational muscle so that is going to be part of the course so the course already launched but this is going to be a supplemental bonus material. So it's going in there and yeah it's a lot I spent months building this course it's extremely detailed comprehensive and yeah it's it's good. Yeah well I encourage everyone listening look let's make 2023 the year you add another stream of income to your real estate business I mean this is a way I've always thought you know real estate's transactional of course in nature. And we want to try to smooth out the in between as much as we can in between clients in between deals rentals are a great way to say I service everyone I service the buyers the sellers the renters or partnering with somebody who does that like an Alexander like if you if you for example for everyone listening if you have a client that's moving to Austin. And once to you know find an apartment for per se you're going to refer Alexander he's the guy he is the guy you want to be if you if you want to take your business to that particular level you can be that person in your local market and I would bet there's not as much competition as there is at the top of the I want to be the top you know sales agent of you know everyone's buying for that spot rentals are often kind of forgotten about and I think it's a good thing for anyone listening because I think it's a good thing for anyone listening because I think I think I'm going to be a good thing for everyone listening to that. Because it means there's less competition and again Alexander is right and saying there really isn't competition but there's fewer players in the space I guess we could say and you know I mean Alexander's made almost a million dollars doing rentals like this is incredibly lucrative business and so you can make great money you could help people that a lot of agents would just discard oh you don't want to buy call me when you're ready to buy right that I mean I bet you have stories of renters that come to you going I reached out to an agent they basically told me to get lost they don't do rentals I mean it happens which is so shocking to me but it does happen. Yeah I get it's I get a lot of other real estate agents are like I don't know what to do with rentals I'm like I'll take them. And then I can make like two three thousand dollars never for all and the agent just didn't know how much money they just lost by like referring that to me. Yeah and it wouldn't have been like a lot of work for them if they only knew how to do very basic foundational things. Yeah. There is another really interesting point with locating that I think makes it really compelling in any market. So you probably saw a lot of market squeeze when it was got really hot or there just wasn't inventory. Yeah. That doesn't happen with apartment locating. I mean if you're like in San Francisco and you're a city this doesn't work in those markets because it just isn't inventory. But in your normal city all of which I lay out on the website. A single building has three four hundred units and you have hundreds of buildings. You're not running that out of inventory. The inventory is going to be there. As always turnover every month as well. Yeah. So the there's always going to be inventory you're never going to get market squeezed out of the business where you could be the world's best real estate agent. But if you're in a market where there's nothing to buy or sell, then it's not going to work out well for you. Yeah. This is just a great way to work with you know a changing market when maybe sales are down rentals tend to tend to go up. So this is the time to invest in a course like this apartment locating master and I'll just end with this. So I was mentioning my girlfriend works at one of these types of buildings where there's 500 units. It's like a super high end luxury building. Some of their three bedrooms not not every market's going to have this of course, but some of their three bedrooms are like $7,000. They pay a $7,000 commission if you bring them now they only work with a couple of agents. It's kind of a goofy building and that's a really extreme example not not every market has things like that. But imagine if you walked somebody into a building and you let the like my girlfriend the way that it works at her building is the agent walks in. Now they know the agents because they only work with a handful of them. My girlfriend does all the work she takes the tour the agent kind of hangs back kind of chimes in when need be. But my girlfriend's job is to sell the building. So she's leading the tour the agents kind of piping in from time to time. And then she goes down and she wants to close the sale to so or the rental. So she you know she does the hard heavy lifting. So she's leading the whole thing. You know they have quotas to hit a lot of these apartment in internal leasing agents for for these buildings. And then a $7,000 check it's written to the agent. It's in there's incredible money in this. Yeah, for me, I would say the average check is about 1500 to 2000. But I did have a deal recently where get a call the morning. And schedule tour with a client the afternoon. And he signs a $4,400 unit lease at a building paying 150% commission. Oh. It's an amazing. That's about like a $6,000 check or so. Yeah, more. That's a good days work. Yeah. So how would everyone out there like to learn to do that? So you know, Alexander's not just saying it's possible. He's like, I'm going to show you how to do it. So check out apartment locating mastery.com. Why not learn from the guy. He's the guy. And also check out his website to get hooked on him. Because what what I really want you to do, whether you invest in his course or not, I encourage you to invest in it. But even if you don't, I want you to look at how he branded himself. His, his B to C website business to consumer website is taco street locating. That's think about how well go to the website. Look at how fun it is. He made a really arduous process, stressful process. Traditionally not a super fun process. He made it fun. And that in and of itself is brilliant. He's going to teach you how to do these kind of things and build this side business. Maybe by the way, maybe you're still like, I don't want to be an apartment. I don't want to do a part of rentals. Well, maybe you could bring on a team member and they could be the apartment with a rental person and you be the sales person. So it's not like even if this doesn't affect you or maybe you're a team you don't really have somebody doing rentals. Oh my gosh, there's so much opportunity here. So 2023, we know it's going to be tough on the sales side. We just know that I wish it wasn't, but it's going to be rentals are where it's at. So apartment locating mastery.com is where you can learn about the course taco street locating is Alexander's website. To see how he services his clients, the content he provides.
