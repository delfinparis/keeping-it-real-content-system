[00:02:42] And now onto the show.
[00:02:57] 95% of what you do every single day is influenced by your subconscious mind.
[00:03:09] Your subconscious mind is home to your beliefs, your emotions, your habits and your memories.
[00:03:20] Today, we're going to focus on our conversation on your subconscious mind, specifically the beliefs and memories you hold,
[00:03:29] the beliefs, the behaviors, the habits you have as a result of your memories, the emotional charge attached to your past experiences.
[00:03:40] Because as you'll learn in the next 30 to 40 minutes, all of your intangibles, all of the challenges and obstacles you face are a byproduct of your beliefs and your memories,
[00:03:57] which facilitate a collection of learned behaviors, behaviors designed to keep you safe, playing small, stuck in a pattern of comfortability, predictability and familiarity.
[00:04:14] And as we move into and through today's conversation, we're going to talk about the why and the how you've come into a collection of these learned behaviors that are keeping you stuck,
[00:04:25] and ultimately shift our focus to talking about the most effective, fastest way to upgrade your beliefs and unlearn the patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving that are holding you back.
[00:04:44] Welcome back to another episode of the inner game of real estate success, the show within the show of the keeping it real podcast that gives you the tools to master your mind, close with confidence and thrive in both business and life.
[00:05:03] My name is Paul Salter. I am your host of these monthly episodes. I'm a mindset and performance coach and I use hypnosis to help my clients get out of their own way by dismantling the destructive patterns of thinking, feeling, believing and behaving that keep them stuck.
[00:05:23] And on the last Thursday of every single month, we have this conversation here, the inner game of real estate success, empowering you with the shifts, the reframes and the upgrades you need to get unstuck out of your own way and to live, be in achieve your potential.
[00:05:43] Today we're digging into the mind, your memories, your subconscious, and we'll ultimately pivot into talking about just how powerful hypnosis is and of course beginning with what it is not what it is, how it works,
[00:05:59] ultimately sharing a little bit more about how I leverage the power of hypnosis to help my clients thrive and achieve their potential. But our conversation first begins with your subconscious mind and the best way to think about the difference between your conscious mind and your subconscious mind is to picture an iceberg.
[00:06:19] When you look at an iceberg, the tip you see above the surface is estimated to be about 10% of the entire iceberg structure. And we can liken the tip of the iceberg to your conscious mind.
[00:06:34] It's what you're deliberately aware of. It's where thought awareness, the present moment reside. Similarly, beneath the surface, in this case the surface of conscious awareness is the vast majority of your mind.
[00:06:48] It's your subconscious home to your memories, your past experiences, which give birth to your beliefs, your emotion, and the set of accompanying behaviors and habits you have that ultimately influence your results, your reality and shape your identity.
[00:07:07] And what's really important to recognize here is that as you go through life and you accumulate one experience after the next, every experience in your mind is a data point.
[00:07:25] And your mind extracts information from this experience and begins to form stories begins to cultivate beliefs. Remember, a belief is nothing more than a lens through which you see the world, yourself and others.
[00:07:39] And it acts as a filter through which you make decisions and take actions. So as you go through these experiences, memories are created. There's an emotional charge of varying intensities and different emotions, of course, attached to these previously lived experiences.
[00:07:57] And all of these continue to gradually build to produce beliefs and behaviors. These beliefs and behaviors at their core are designed to keep you safe.
[00:08:11] And what I really need you to hear is that you are programmed to survive. You are not programmed to thrive.
[00:08:22] Yet here you are listening to a personal development podcast in the real estate space because you're trying to thrive. You're committed to thrive.
[00:08:30] Or maybe you're already thriving, but it feels exhausting, challenging, and you question if it's sustainable. Are you capable of thriving at the next level?
[00:08:39] And I'm here to tell you candidly, it's an uphill battle. Because yes, your hard-wired program to survive.
[00:08:47] And that's because you, me, as human beings, we are a community-centric species wired to belong.
[00:08:56] And thousands and thousands of years ago, when our ancestors were kicked out of our respective tribe or community, when they were rejected, judged, and ultimately abandoned,
[00:09:09] well, it was pretty much a death sentence by starvation or that saber-toothed tiger lurking around the corner.
[00:09:17] Fast forward all of these thousands of years, we still have that same deep biological need to belong because it was how, and continues to be how our species survived all of these centuries.
[00:09:32] The problem, however, is that as we are going through, particularly the early first few years of life, and we have our tribe that we don't get to choose,
[00:09:45] well, impressed upon us from our immediate tribe, our parents, our siblings, our family, our neighbors, our community,
[00:09:52] in addition to entertainment sources and our experience otherwise, a collection of information is repeatedly pressed upon us.
[00:10:03] A collection of emotional experiences becomes our default norm. And as a result, researchers estimate that by the age of seven, 95% of our belief system is formed.
[00:10:15] Let me give you a couple examples. One of the easiest ones that is coming up often in a lot of the clients I work with, and maybe you relate to, is we talk about the scarcity mindset versus the abundant mindset as it comes to money.
[00:10:30] And if you grew up in a household where every penny was pitched, there was barely enough just to meet basic needs, never enough to get what you want, rich people or jerks, those who are wealthy or assholes.
[00:10:42] Well, guess what? You learned that this constant background noise of anxiety, fear, anger, resentment around money was the norm.
[00:10:53] You didn't choose to experience it as a 3, 4, 5, 6 year old, but your parents, your immediate environment, that was there every day experience.
[00:11:01] So as a natural byproduct, you absorbed that too. And now your emotional home, your core foundational emotions that your subconscious craves for the point of having safety, predictability and familiarity may be rooted in lack, anxiety, worry, fear, scarcity, fear of loss, risk aversion.
[00:11:22] So you go throughout life, repeating patterns to help you get your fix of lack, anxiety, scarcity around money.
[00:11:31] Because again, it's familiar, it's a pattern that's predictable, comfortable, and therefore safe. And your subconscious one has one, subconscious mind, excuse me, has one overarching predictive, our primary objective, keeping you safe.
[00:11:50] So it's an uphill battle to say the leaf, and I'm building a big foundation for us, because we're going to go a different direction in a moment.
[00:11:57] But with that said, your beliefs, I alluded to it earlier, their filters, their lenses through which you see the world, your belief about yourself, are you worthy, deserving and capable, your belief about others, are they likable, are they trustworthy?
[00:12:11] Your belief about life, is it fair or unfair, is it happening to you or for you?
[00:12:18] The manifestation or byproduct of these beliefs begins to show up in the words you use, to speak to and about yourself, your thoughts, they then begin to show up in your actions, or your consistent in actions, these over time repeatedly execute to become your habits.
[00:12:36] And all of a sudden we've got this downstream domino effect of your beliefs, which you're not responsible for, though you're the only one who can do something about them, and we'll come back to that later, your beliefs influence your words, which influence your habits, which influence your results, which shape your identity.
[00:12:55] So so many of you are trying to wheel and deal, go, go, out work hustle and muscle through to get to that next level.
[00:13:03] And I'm here to tell you there's a far more effective, inefficient way.
[00:13:10] And it requires candidly some uncomfortable work that challenges, threatens your identity, your ego, your sense of normalcy, if you will.
[00:13:21] The only way you've ever known to do and be, yet if you're willing to pause, look inward and approach this problem that you're trying to solve to get to the next level, there's an opportunity to do different, to be different, so you can both achieve and experience different.
[00:13:43] And I want to dig into that more. So this is really cool concept.
[00:13:47] You know, the scientific community term for it is memory reconsolidation. And the, and the big premise here is that memory reconsolidation is the process of rewiring the emotional association tied to a memory, so it no longer sabotages your present performance.
[00:14:08] Remember, I shared earlier every experience you accumulate throughout your life, your subconscious views it as a data point.
[00:14:17] It takes the pertinent information and begins to filter out information. The more and more you have experiences to continue to validate and reinforce the beliefs that have been constructed.
[00:14:26] And the reason that's noteworthy is because as you go throughout life and you have these experiences through your particular lenses, you further strengthen those beliefs first and foremost, it cuts off your ability to see differing or other perspectives or frames of mind, and it's limiting.
[00:14:48] And until you look inward to uncover the when, the why, the how, you came to possess these beliefs. How, at one point in time, they served you, they helped you, they protected you, you're not going to be able to actually make any meaningful significance sustainable change in your income, your happiness, your confidence, your health, your wealth, your well being or success.
[00:15:13] However, memory reconciliation is our opportunity, it's our golden ticket. So this process, and I'm going to break it down more simplistically in a moment.
[00:15:22] We don't erase your memories, of course, but when you begin to look inward to edit the emotional charge attached to these memories so that it stops hijacking you at the exact moments you need to be calm, clear and decisive.
[00:15:39] Suddenly, you reclaim your power and that power reclamation process is taking back energy, the emotional charge that was once attached to that memory is taken back as energy that energy can then be used to a let go of any beliefs that were formed and be most importantly to build new beliefs and the accompanying set of complimentary behaviors you need to step into that next best version of you.
[00:16:06] So here's the framework and here's the powerful, I guess, analogy. You know, your brain saves and files memories like a Microsoft Word document. Memories aren't like a tattoo, they're not permanent. And although I guess yes, we can get rid of tattoos.
[00:16:24] The process of memory, reconsolidation and updating a memory is not nearly as painful as what I've heard to be an excruciatingly painful process of getting a tattoo removed.
[00:16:38] So the analogy I want to share with you is that your memories are like a Microsoft Word document. And what I mean by that is every time again you have an experience in life, think of it as your mind writing a quick synopsis, some more detailed and intense than the others in a Microsoft Word document and then saving that file, stuffing it down into your subconscious.
[00:17:04] And when an event or moment or circumstance triggers a need to retrieve that file, your subconscious suddenly brings a top of mind reviews, okay, from this experience that sounds similar to the one we relived 25 years ago, we learned we need to behave in this way so that X, Y and Z can be accomplished.
[00:17:24] Let me share a very common example. You're someone that when somebody provides you a critical piece of feedback, you are triggered, you suddenly find yourself on edge, agitated defensive, maybe even an urge to lash out to attack and injustice has occurred.
[00:17:43] You feel personally attacked, you've taken something personally, even if a third party didn't interpret it that way and the specific person you feel triggered by had no ill intention whatsoever.
[00:17:56] What's taking place there is at light speed, your mind is going back to that moment at nine years old when you were bullied on the playground and you felt attacked and the only way you knew to protect yourself and to stand up for yourself was to verbally lash out, maybe physically even lash out.
[00:18:12] That same nine year old boy or girl and his or her accompanying patterns of safety and protection still lives in you today. And when triggered, it comes to the surface and it plays out.
[00:18:25] And this happens not just with anger, this happens with perfectionism, procrastination when self-doubt takes a seat in your driver's seat and hijacks the steering wheel.
[00:18:35] Every time this is occurring, your mind is accessing all of these old files, these memories to see when this situation happened previously, you protected yourself or you kept yourself safe by doing X, Y and Z.
[00:18:51] And yes, they served you at that time, but you're not nine years old anymore.
[00:18:55] You don't have an immature emotional regulation ability. You don't have an immature nervous system. You're an adult. You're capable of managing and regulating your nervous system. You're capable of managing your emotions.
[00:19:10] But during your youth and your younger years, you're adolescents and during moments as an adult that were incredibly emotionally charged, painful and traumatic, maybe you weren't because some situations we experience, there's no words, tools, blueprint or playbook for.
[00:19:28] And you're stuck in such a fight or flight, triggered nervous system state for so long your body is doing anything and everything it can do in code, safety, safety, safety, protection, protection, protection,
[00:19:45] that a new set of accompanying beliefs and behaviors is formed. Another classic example, you know, maybe you quit your nine to five, you go all in on this passion project and it doesn't work out. It fails, you go bankrupt or you have crippling debt, you feel like a nobody, a failure, everybody judged you, you feel shame, guilt, anger, sadness, embarrassment.
[00:20:05] That's enough for a lot of people to say, I'm never going to try again. I'm only going to play it safe the rest of my life and they live the rest of their life as a shell of themselves playing small, operating a fraction of their potential because this belief and the set of accompanying behaviors or in this case lack thereof action and behavior are byproducts learned experiences from a traumatic event in their life that directly threatened their identity and ultimately the question of what is the most important thing that is happening in their life.
[00:20:36] So with memory consolidation and ultimately one of the fastest most effective ways to unlearn the beliefs, feeling states, thinking and behaviors holding you back is by capitalizing on this concept and using hypnosis. So I want to go back to this analogy because I know I got sidetracked there but when we're opening up that file that Microsoft Word document.
[00:21:04] Every time you open that file, that past memory, that challenging experience, eight years old, you're giving a presentation in front of your classmates and you forget your line, everybody laughs at you, even your teacher, it's humiliating, it's embarrassing. That moment forward, you're afraid, you're anxious to speak up in front of small and large groups, you hide your voice, you play small, you don't share your honest thoughts and opinions. All of that's learned.
[00:21:28] Yet the way our memory works is when we in a safe and supportive environment, reconnect with or open that file, we can go back and edit it, we can diffuse or drain the emotional charge that was once attached to it, we can reframe it, see it differently, provide empathy and ultimately do the work necessary to let go of any destructive beliefs and behaviors that came as a result of said belief.
[00:21:57] As a result, you experience a positive ripple effect in real time and abundance of energy that wasn't once available that you can now put forward to do to take action on what it is you already know you need to be doing to achieve your next level of success.
[00:22:16] Another example, pay attention, I'm moving a million miles an hour today, I'm feeling good, I hope you're picking up when I'm throwing down. You know, one of my clients, phenomenal real estate agent.
[00:22:25] About across the seven figure mark personally in her commissions in 2026, she's made more money every single year for going on 10 years if I recall correctly, she's crushing it yet she like you like me and this happens at every single fucking level of success financially, health wise and otherwise.
[00:22:48] There are destructive ways of thinking, being and feeling that lead to feelings of imposter syndrome, questioning our worthiness and our enoughness to sustain or even achieve next level success and for this particular client, she was born to two immigrant parents who busted their ass when they moved to the States on the promise that they would provide a much better life for their children.
[00:23:13] My client being one of those children watched her mom and dad work tirelessly one sacrifice after the next to provide a better life here in the States for her and her siblings.
[00:23:28] Guess what my client by direct absorption like I alluded to in the beginning of this conversation, she absorbed that same tenacity ambition.
[00:23:40] Next to nobody can match her work ethic type of attitude and propensity to take action and that's what has fueled her incredible success like I mentioned the past 10 gone on 11 years more income more deals more relationships year after year on paper.
[00:24:02] She's absolutely crushing it physically, however, inconsistently taking care of herself, burn it.
[00:24:10] She's constantly trying to start out emotionally drained a glass of wine before bed every night, gradually becoming two, sometimes a bottle before bed, struggling to sleep, struggling to exercise, meditate her care for herself regularly, constantly on edge, feeling uncomfortable, unsafe when she's not working, struggling to disconnect, struggling to detach her results from herself worth it as you can imagine.
[00:24:35] This is a cocktail to operate well below your potential and that's what played out the last couple of years despite her success on paper.
[00:24:48] It was internal warfare chaos very few moments of calm masked by moments of stress her nervous system always triggered on edge and underneath at all, guess what?
[00:25:03] She didn't feel deserving or good enough for this success making great money has the status the recognition both her parents were immigrants who worked incredibly hard to make and meets ends meet just to provide and here she is with significantly more money to her name.
[00:25:21] To I deserve it am I out shining my parents that's not fair they sacrifice so much for me all they did for me.
[00:25:30] The guilt the resentment the sadness the shame the anger the bitterness on top of the entire time wait a second I was born to two immigrants who am I to make this much money to have this impact to build and have these relationships to attend these events the imposter syndrome the enoughness it was a pattern of destruction internally.
[00:25:50] This client struggling to keep it together until she was courageous enough to ask for help courageous enough to look inward to begin owning confronting some of these destructive ways of believing being thinking feeling doing.
[00:26:17] And through the deep work we're going to begin talking about here momentarily and a willingness to look within let go of that wasn't serving her even if it felt scary different or uncomfortable.
[00:26:34] As allowed my client to experience more harmony more ease or flow in her day to day life vastly improved health self care well being habits consistent in her exercise or meditation her sleep protecting her sleep's the perhaps most importantly finding her voice and confidently taking aligned action.
[00:27:03] True to her authentic self.
[00:27:06] And that work I've been alluding to that capitalizes on this concept of memory reconciledation.
[00:27:13] It's high performance hypnotherapy and mindset coaching and I want to pivot our conversation to digging into hypnosis and of course.
[00:27:24] For me the best place to begin and having this conversation is making it abundantly clear what hypnosis is not many of you you heard hypnosis and your mind immediately went to me dangling a pocket watch in front of you.
[00:27:48] Asking you to clock like a chicken or maybe back to some hypnosis stage show you saw a comedy event on a cruise ship or maybe even your own high school graduation.
[00:27:58] That is unlike anything I do or use when working with my clients hypnosis is not magic.
[00:28:07] It's not brain controls not mind control is not brainwashing excuse me hypnosis is a natural state of mind hypnosis is a safe state of mind at the natural safe state of mind you have already been in today multiple times you see hypnosis is just a word used to describe the primary brain wave you are producing at any given moment.
[00:28:32] So right now you're highly engaged and you're listening to this conversation and hopefully you're engaging it with your own self talk and questions and reflection throughout you're primarily producing what are known as beta brain waves and after this long productive work day you're going to go home you're going to take a shower you're going to finally begin to let go and relax your beta brain wave production is going to come down and you're going to begin to primarily produce alpha brain waves.
[00:28:57] And after that hot shower you're finally going to fall asleep and ultimately during sleep you're going to produce what's known as delta brain waves but there exists a sweet spot between sleep in between that slight relaxation I mentioned after that hot shower and that state is our sweet spot theta brain wave production and that's the hypnotic state it's the same state of mind you experience the moment you transition from sleeping to waking.
[00:29:24] It's the same state of mind you experience when you're caught up in a good book podcast your favorite TV show or when you're deeply immersed in the flow state during a deal or on a project at work.
[00:29:37] I share all of that to clarify and reiterate just how natural this hypnotic state of mind is now to significant benefits emerge when you enter this hypnotic state intentional number one.
[00:29:53] The harsh inner critic that judgmental voice you have that constantly reminds you that you're not good enough that'll never work you're not smart enough you can't do this yeah in hypnosis we sidestep all of that noise and negativity we quiet that pain in the ass and two we connect directly with your subconscious mind remember your subconscious mind is home to your memories and therefore your beliefs your emotions and your head.
[00:30:23] So by being able to connect with your subconscious mind quiet that harsh inner critic we begin to have an opportunity to open up some of those past files or Microsoft Word documents where some of these accompanying beliefs and destructive behaviors were first learned and we can use hypnosis to uncover the origin of when why and how you learned performance anxiety.
[00:30:51] To believe you're not good enough worthy enough for deserving to have learned procrastination or perfectionism and learning the when the how and the why in and of itself creates a powerful opportunity for a perspective shift more importantly it creates an opportunity to do the unlearning to remove the emotional charge reclaim that energy that power and use it to build the new set of believe.
[00:31:28] So let's go one step further sounds good you're picking up what I'm putting down how does it really work well first and foremost we need to understand a couple benefits so I mentioned that in hypnosis you're primarily producing what are known as theta brain waves and it's in this state
[00:31:50] that you're incredibly incredibly malleable suggestive to feedback perspective shifts reframing and you heard me say in the beginning of this conversation that researchers estimate by the age of seven 95% of your belief system is formed guess what between the ages of zero and seven
[00:32:10] you're primarily producing theta brain waves that you're very malleable that Microsoft Word document is open ready for edits and upgrades so hypnosis puts you into that malleable state where upgrades can be delivered on demand and number two we enter we share then the concept of neuroplasticity so
[00:32:34] neuroplasticity is a is a basically the opportunity for you to begin building new neural pathways you know a neural pathway is essentially your brain's ability to communicate when a behavior is formed your brain craves efficiency your brain wants to do things as efficiently as possible to conserve energy
[00:32:56] and the way that it does that is through habit formation so neurons begin to fire together they begin to wire together all throughout your brain to speed up the transmission of electrical current and ultimately make sure that some of these tasks in this case behaviors can be carried out more efficiently and more effectively.
[00:33:19] Well many decades centuries ago the prominent belief or school of thought was that your brain was kind of hardwired we're we're fixed we're limited we can't grow expand today we know that is not the case and neuroplasticity is the explanation the concept that highlights we can build new neural pathways we can stop traveling current or pre existing ones and there is a better way to learn to be to think to do to grow.
[00:33:47] And the analogy I like to use for this is let's just highlight for example the destructive mindset program of perfectionism and if perfectionism is something you struggle with often it shows up in every area of your life you know the way that we can think of that neural pathway is it's like a freaking eight lane highway there is no issue with traffic there it is easy breezy to travel that highway easy to move from point of view.
[00:34:17] And then you can get to the point of view at a moment notice to get to where you want to go meaning that you ride or drive that neural pathway of perfectionism quite often well let's say you're doing the work you're right you're taking consistent action and you have the support and accountability you need to begin let go letting go excuse me of these perfectionistic tendencies well the process of what's actually happening is suddenly there are some orange detour cones.
[00:34:47] That are placed on that highway and they take you literally off roading and for the first couple of times you're leaning into these new behaviors it doesn't have to be perfect before I submit that proposal before I draft that new job position description I'm just going to send it well it's literally like using the detour cones off the highway and beginning to blaze your own trail you're walking through tall grass tickets rocks mud and it's uncomfortable it's much more challenging it's far less effective and it's not going to be a lot of fun.
[00:35:17] It feels different.
[00:35:20] Yet the next opportunity you do it again.
[00:35:24] And the next time you feel a tendency in a gravitational pull towards those old perfectionistic patterns you take it again and again suddenly you blazed yourself on nice little dirt path.
[00:35:35] And the more you begin to use this path that becomes clearer becomes more efficient more effective and suddenly it's spacious enough it's well traveled enough where you can pave a one lane road and then suddenly a two lane road and so on and so forth the more you use it next thing you know you've greased an entirely new eight lane highway the other one as crumble it's hard to use you don't even remember even how to get there as much.
[00:35:58] That's neuroplasticity at its core so again through memory reconciledation neuroplasticity and intentionally priming yourself to be in that theta brainwave state you have an opportunity to unlearn the core beliefs emotional states and behaviors that are keeping you stuck facilitating a pattern of you getting in your own way and when you learn them you can harness the energy.

Your subconscious mind is home to your beliefs, your emotions, your habits and your memories. Today, we're going to focus on our conversation on your subconscious mind, specifically the beliefs and memories you hold, the beliefs, the behaviors, the habits you have as a result of your memories, the emotional charge attached to your past experiences. Because as you'll learn in the next 30 to 40 minutes, all of your intangibles, all of the challenges and obstacles you face are a byproduct of your beliefs and your memories, which facilitate a collection of learned behaviors, behaviors designed to keep you safe, playing small, stuck in a pattern of comfortability, predictability and familiarity. And as we move into and through today's conversation, we're going to talk about the why and the how you've come into a collection of these learned behaviors that are keeping you stuck, and ultimately shift our focus to talking about the most effective, fastest way to upgrade your beliefs and unlearn the patterns of thinking, feeling and behaving that are holding you back. Welcome back to another episode of the inner game of real estate success, the show within the show of the keeping it real podcast that gives you the tools to master your mind, close with confidence and thrive in both business and life. My name is Paul Salter. I am your host of these monthly episodes. I'm a mindset and performance coach and I use hypnosis to help my clients get out of their own way by dismantling the destructive patterns of thinking, feeling, believing and behaving that keep them stuck. And on the last Thursday of every single month, we have this conversation here, the inner game of real estate success, empowering you with the shifts, the reframes and the upgrades you need to get unstuck out of your own way and to live, be in achieve your potential. Today we're digging into the mind, your memories, your subconscious, and we'll ultimately pivot into talking about just how powerful hypnosis is and of course beginning with what it is not what it is, how it works, ultimately sharing a little bit more about how I leverage the power of hypnosis to help my clients thrive and achieve their potential. But our conversation first begins with your subconscious mind and the best way to think about the difference between your conscious mind and your subconscious mind is to picture an iceberg. When you look at an iceberg, the tip you see above the surface is estimated to be about 10% of the entire iceberg structure. And we can liken the tip of the iceberg to your conscious mind. It's what you're deliberately aware of. It's where thought awareness, the present moment reside. Similarly, beneath the surface, in this case the surface of conscious awareness is the vast majority of your mind. It's your subconscious home to your memories, your past experiences, which give birth to your beliefs, your emotion, and the set of accompanying behaviors and habits you have that ultimately influence your results, your reality and shape your identity. And what's really important to recognize here is that as you go through life and you accumulate one experience after the next, every experience in your mind is a data point. And your mind extracts information from this experience and begins to form stories begins to cultivate beliefs. Remember, a belief is nothing more than a lens through which you see the world, yourself and others. And it acts as a filter through which you make decisions and take actions. So as you go through these experiences, memories are created. There's an emotional charge of varying intensities and different emotions, of course, attached to these previously lived experiences. And all of these continue to gradually build to produce beliefs and behaviors. These beliefs and behaviors at their core are designed to keep you safe. And what I really need you to hear is that you are programmed to survive. You are not programmed to thrive. Yet here you are listening to a personal development podcast in the real estate space because you're trying to thrive. You're committed to thrive. Or maybe you're already thriving, but it feels exhausting, challenging, and you question if it's sustainable. Are you capable of thriving at the next level? And I'm here to tell you candidly, it's an uphill battle. Because yes, your hard-wired program to survive. And that's because you, me, as human beings, we are a community-centric species wired to belong. And thousands and thousands of years ago, when our ancestors were kicked out of our respective tribe or community, when they were rejected, judged, and ultimately abandoned, well, it was pretty much a death sentence by starvation or that saber-toothed tiger lurking around the corner. Fast forward all of these thousands of years, we still have that same deep biological need to belong because it was how, and continues to be how our species survived all of these centuries. The problem, however, is that as we are going through, particularly the early first few years of life, and we have our tribe that we don't get to choose, well, impressed upon us from our immediate tribe, our parents, our siblings, our family, our neighbors, our community, in addition to entertainment sources and our experience otherwise, a collection of information is repeatedly pressed upon us. A collection of emotional experiences becomes our default norm. And as a result, researchers estimate that by the age of seven, 95% of our belief system is formed. Let me give you a couple examples. One of the easiest ones that is coming up often in a lot of the clients I work with, and maybe you relate to, is we talk about the scarcity mindset versus the abundant mindset as it comes to money. And if you grew up in a household where every penny was pitched, there was barely enough just to meet basic needs, never enough to get what you want, rich people or jerks, those who are wealthy or assholes. Well, guess what? You learned that this constant background noise of anxiety, fear, anger, resentment around money was the norm. You didn't choose to experience it as a 3, 4, 5, 6 year old, but your parents, your immediate environment, that was there every day experience. So as a natural byproduct, you absorbed that too. And now your emotional home, your core foundational emotions that your subconscious craves for the point of having safety, predictability and familiarity may be rooted in lack, anxiety, worry, fear, scarcity, fear of loss, risk aversion. So you go throughout life, repeating patterns to help you get your fix of lack, anxiety, scarcity around money. Because again, it's familiar, it's a pattern that's predictable, comfortable, and therefore safe. And your subconscious one has one, subconscious mind, excuse me, has one overarching predictive, our primary objective, keeping you safe. So it's an uphill battle to say the leaf, and I'm building a big foundation for us, because we're going to go a different direction in a moment. But with that said, your beliefs, I alluded to it earlier, their filters, their lenses through which you see the world, your belief about yourself, are you worthy, deserving and capable, your belief about others, are they likable, are they trustworthy? Your belief about life, is it fair or unfair, is it happening to you or for you? The manifestation or byproduct of these beliefs begins to show up in the words you use, to speak to and about yourself, your thoughts, they then begin to show up in your actions, or your consistent in actions, these over time repeatedly execute to become your habits. And all of a sudden we've got this downstream domino effect of your beliefs, which you're not responsible for, though you're the only one who can do something about them, and we'll come back to that later, your beliefs influence your words, which influence your habits, which influence your results, which shape your identity. So so many of you are trying to wheel and deal, go, go, out work hustle and muscle through to get to that next level. And I'm here to tell you there's a far more effective, inefficient way. And it requires candidly some uncomfortable work that challenges, threatens your identity, your ego, your sense of normalcy, if you will. The only way you've ever known to do and be, yet if you're willing to pause, look inward and approach this problem that you're trying to solve to get to the next level, there's an opportunity to do different, to be different, so you can both achieve and experience different. And I want to dig into that more. So this is really cool concept. You know, the scientific community term for it is memory reconsolidation. And the, and the big premise here is that memory reconsolidation is the process of rewiring the emotional association tied to a memory, so it no longer sabotages your present performance. Remember, I shared earlier every experience you accumulate throughout your life, your subconscious views it as a data point. It takes the pertinent information and begins to filter out information. The more and more you have experiences to continue to validate and reinforce the beliefs that have been constructed. And the reason that's noteworthy is because as you go throughout life and you have these experiences through your particular lenses, you further strengthen those beliefs first and foremost, it cuts off your ability to see differing or other perspectives or frames of mind, and it's limiting. And until you look inward to uncover the when, the why, the how, you came to possess these beliefs. How, at one point in time, they served you, they helped you, they protected you, you're not going to be able to actually make any meaningful significance sustainable change in your income, your happiness, your confidence, your health, your wealth, your well being or success. However, memory reconciliation is our opportunity, it's our golden ticket. So this process, and I'm going to break it down more simplistically in a moment. We don't erase your memories, of course, but when you begin to look inward to edit the emotional charge attached to these memories so that it stops hijacking you at the exact moments you need to be calm, clear and decisive. Suddenly, you reclaim your power and that power reclamation process is taking back energy, the emotional charge that was once attached to that memory is taken back as energy that energy can then be used to a let go of any beliefs that were formed and be most importantly to build new beliefs and the accompanying set of complimentary behaviors you need to step into that next best version of you. So here's the framework and here's the powerful, I guess, analogy. You know, your brain saves and files memories like a Microsoft Word document. Memories aren't like a tattoo, they're not permanent. And although I guess yes, we can get rid of tattoos. The process of memory, reconsolidation and updating a memory is not nearly as painful as what I've heard to be an excruciatingly painful process of getting a tattoo removed. So the analogy I want to share with you is that your memories are like a Microsoft Word document. And what I mean by that is every time again you have an experience in life, think of it as your mind writing a quick synopsis, some more detailed and intense than the others in a Microsoft Word document and then saving that file, stuffing it down into your subconscious. And when an event or moment or circumstance triggers a need to retrieve that file, your subconscious suddenly brings a top of mind reviews, okay, from this experience that sounds similar to the one we relived 25 years ago, we learned we need to behave in this way so that X, Y and Z can be accomplished. Let me share a very common example. You're someone that when somebody provides you a critical piece of feedback, you are triggered, you suddenly find yourself on edge, agitated defensive, maybe even an urge to lash out to attack and injustice has occurred. You feel personally attacked, you've taken something personally, even if a third party didn't interpret it that way and the specific person you feel triggered by had no ill intention whatsoever. What's taking place there is at light speed, your mind is going back to that moment at nine years old when you were bullied on the playground and you felt attacked and the only way you knew to protect yourself and to stand up for yourself was to verbally lash out, maybe physically even lash out. That same nine year old boy or girl and his or her accompanying patterns of safety and protection still lives in you today. And when triggered, it comes to the surface and it plays out. And this happens not just with anger, this happens with perfectionism, procrastination when self-doubt takes a seat in your driver's seat and hijacks the steering wheel. Every time this is occurring, your mind is accessing all of these old files, these memories to see when this situation happened previously, you protected yourself or you kept yourself safe by doing X, Y and Z. And yes, they served you at that time, but you're not nine years old anymore. You don't have an immature emotional regulation ability. You don't have an immature nervous system. You're an adult. You're capable of managing and regulating your nervous system. You're capable of managing your emotions. But during your youth and your younger years, you're adolescents and during moments as an adult that were incredibly emotionally charged, painful and traumatic, maybe you weren't because some situations we experience, there's no words, tools, blueprint or playbook for. And you're stuck in such a fight or flight, triggered nervous system state for so long your body is doing anything and everything it can do in code, safety, safety, safety, protection, protection, protection, that a new set of accompanying beliefs and behaviors is formed. Another classic example, you know, maybe you quit your nine to five, you go all in on this passion project and it doesn't work out. It fails, you go bankrupt or you have crippling debt, you feel like a nobody, a failure, everybody judged you, you feel shame, guilt, anger, sadness, embarrassment. That's enough for a lot of people to say, I'm never going to try again. I'm only going to play it safe the rest of my life and they live the rest of their life as a shell of themselves playing small, operating a fraction of their potential because this belief and the set of accompanying behaviors or in this case lack thereof action and behavior are byproducts learned experiences from a traumatic event in their life that directly threatened their identity and ultimately the question of what is the most important thing that is happening in their life. So with memory consolidation and ultimately one of the fastest most effective ways to unlearn the beliefs, feeling states, thinking and behaviors holding you back is by capitalizing on this concept and using hypnosis. So I want to go back to this analogy because I know I got sidetracked there but when we're opening up that file that Microsoft Word document. Every time you open that file, that past memory, that challenging experience, eight years old, you're giving a presentation in front of your classmates and you forget your line, everybody laughs at you, even your teacher, it's humiliating, it's embarrassing. That moment forward, you're afraid, you're anxious to speak up in front of small and large groups, you hide your voice, you play small, you don't share your honest thoughts and opinions. All of that's learned. Yet the way our memory works is when we in a safe and supportive environment, reconnect with or open that file, we can go back and edit it, we can diffuse or drain the emotional charge that was once attached to it, we can reframe it, see it differently, provide empathy and ultimately do the work necessary to let go of any destructive beliefs and behaviors that came as a result of said belief. As a result, you experience a positive ripple effect in real time and abundance of energy that wasn't once available that you can now put forward to do to take action on what it is you already know you need to be doing to achieve your next level of success. Another example, pay attention, I'm moving a million miles an hour today, I'm feeling good, I hope you're picking up when I'm throwing down. You know, one of my clients, phenomenal real estate agent. About across the seven figure mark personally in her commissions in 2026, she's made more money every single year for going on 10 years if I recall correctly, she's crushing it yet she like you like me and this happens at every single fucking level of success financially, health wise and otherwise. There are destructive ways of thinking, being and feeling that lead to feelings of imposter syndrome, questioning our worthiness and our enoughness to sustain or even achieve next level success and for this particular client, she was born to two immigrant parents who busted their ass when they moved to the States on the promise that they would provide a much better life for their children. My client being one of those children watched her mom and dad work tirelessly one sacrifice after the next to provide a better life here in the States for her and her siblings. Guess what my client by direct absorption like I alluded to in the beginning of this conversation, she absorbed that same tenacity ambition. Next to nobody can match her work ethic type of attitude and propensity to take action and that's what has fueled her incredible success like I mentioned the past 10 gone on 11 years more income more deals more relationships year after year on paper. She's absolutely crushing it physically, however, inconsistently taking care of herself, burn it. She's constantly trying to start out emotionally drained a glass of wine before bed every night, gradually becoming two, sometimes a bottle before bed, struggling to sleep, struggling to exercise, meditate her care for herself regularly, constantly on edge, feeling uncomfortable, unsafe when she's not working, struggling to disconnect, struggling to detach her results from herself worth it as you can imagine. This is a cocktail to operate well below your potential and that's what played out the last couple of years despite her success on paper. It was internal warfare chaos very few moments of calm masked by moments of stress her nervous system always triggered on edge and underneath at all, guess what? She didn't feel deserving or good enough for this success making great money has the status the recognition both her parents were immigrants who worked incredibly hard to make and meets ends meet just to provide and here she is with significantly more money to her name. To I deserve it am I out shining my parents that's not fair they sacrifice so much for me all they did for me. The guilt the resentment the sadness the shame the anger the bitterness on top of the entire time wait a second I was born to two immigrants who am I to make this much money to have this impact to build and have these relationships to attend these events the imposter syndrome the enoughness it was a pattern of destruction internally. This client struggling to keep it together until she was courageous enough to ask for help courageous enough to look inward to begin owning confronting some of these destructive ways of believing being thinking feeling doing. And through the deep work we're going to begin talking about here momentarily and a willingness to look within let go of that wasn't serving her even if it felt scary different or uncomfortable. As allowed my client to experience more harmony more ease or flow in her day to day life vastly improved health self care well being habits consistent in her exercise or meditation her sleep protecting her sleep's the perhaps most importantly finding her voice and confidently taking aligned action. True to her authentic self. And that work I've been alluding to that capitalizes on this concept of memory reconciledation. It's high performance hypnotherapy and mindset coaching and I want to pivot our conversation to digging into hypnosis and of course. For me the best place to begin and having this conversation is making it abundantly clear what hypnosis is not many of you you heard hypnosis and your mind immediately went to me dangling a pocket watch in front of you. Asking you to clock like a chicken or maybe back to some hypnosis stage show you saw a comedy event on a cruise ship or maybe even your own high school graduation. That is unlike anything I do or use when working with my clients hypnosis is not magic. It's not brain controls not mind control is not brainwashing excuse me hypnosis is a natural state of mind hypnosis is a safe state of mind at the natural safe state of mind you have already been in today multiple times you see hypnosis is just a word used to describe the primary brain wave you are producing at any given moment. So right now you're highly engaged and you're listening to this conversation and hopefully you're engaging it with your own self talk and questions and reflection throughout you're primarily producing what are known as beta brain waves and after this long productive work day you're going to go home you're going to take a shower you're going to finally begin to let go and relax your beta brain wave production is going to come down and you're going to begin to primarily produce alpha brain waves. And after that hot shower you're finally going to fall asleep and ultimately during sleep you're going to produce what's known as delta brain waves but there exists a sweet spot between sleep in between that slight relaxation I mentioned after that hot shower and that state is our sweet spot theta brain wave production and that's the hypnotic state it's the same state of mind you experience the moment you transition from sleeping to waking. It's the same state of mind you experience when you're caught up in a good book podcast your favorite TV show or when you're deeply immersed in the flow state during a deal or on a project at work. I share all of that to clarify and reiterate just how natural this hypnotic state of mind is now to significant benefits emerge when you enter this hypnotic state intentional number one. The harsh inner critic that judgmental voice you have that constantly reminds you that you're not good enough that'll never work you're not smart enough you can't do this yeah in hypnosis we sidestep all of that noise and negativity we quiet that pain in the ass and two we connect directly with your subconscious mind remember your subconscious mind is home to your memories and therefore your beliefs your emotions and your head. So by being able to connect with your subconscious mind quiet that harsh inner critic we begin to have an opportunity to open up some of those past files or Microsoft Word documents where some of these accompanying beliefs and destructive behaviors were first learned and we can use hypnosis to uncover the origin of when why and how you learned performance anxiety. To believe you're not good enough worthy enough for deserving to have learned procrastination or perfectionism and learning the when the how and the why in and of itself creates a powerful opportunity for a perspective shift more importantly it creates an opportunity to do the unlearning to remove the emotional charge reclaim that energy that power and use it to build the new set of believe. So let's go one step further sounds good you're picking up what I'm putting down how does it really work well first and foremost we need to understand a couple benefits so I mentioned that in hypnosis you're primarily producing what are known as theta brain waves and it's in this state that you're incredibly incredibly malleable suggestive to feedback perspective shifts reframing and you heard me say in the beginning of this conversation that researchers estimate by the age of seven 95% of your belief system is formed guess what between the ages of zero and seven you're primarily producing theta brain waves that you're very malleable that Microsoft Word document is open ready for edits and upgrades so hypnosis puts you into that malleable state where upgrades can be delivered on demand and number two we enter we share then the concept of neuroplasticity so neuroplasticity is a is a basically the opportunity for you to begin building new neural pathways you know a neural pathway is essentially your brain's ability to communicate when a behavior is formed your brain craves efficiency your brain wants to do things as efficiently as possible to conserve energy and the way that it does that is through habit formation so neurons begin to fire together they begin to wire together all throughout your brain to speed up the transmission of electrical current and ultimately make sure that some of these tasks in this case behaviors can be carried out more efficiently and more effectively. Well many decades centuries ago the prominent belief or school of thought was that your brain was kind of hardwired we're we're fixed we're limited we can't grow expand today we know that is not the case and neuroplasticity is the explanation the concept that highlights we can build new neural pathways we can stop traveling current or pre existing ones and there is a better way to learn to be to think to do to grow. And the analogy I like to use for this is let's just highlight for example the destructive mindset program of perfectionism and if perfectionism is something you struggle with often it shows up in every area of your life you know the way that we can think of that neural pathway is it's like a freaking eight lane highway there is no issue with traffic there it is easy breezy to travel that highway easy to move from point of view. And then you can get to the point of view at a moment notice to get to where you want to go meaning that you ride or drive that neural pathway of perfectionism quite often well let's say you're doing the work you're right you're taking consistent action and you have the support and accountability you need to begin let go letting go excuse me of these perfectionistic tendencies well the process of what's actually happening is suddenly there are some orange detour cones. That are placed on that highway and they take you literally off roading and for the first couple of times you're leaning into these new behaviors it doesn't have to be perfect before I submit that proposal before I draft that new job position description I'm just going to send it well it's literally like using the detour cones off the highway and beginning to blaze your own trail you're walking through tall grass tickets rocks mud and it's uncomfortable it's much more challenging it's far less effective and it's not going to be a lot of fun. It feels different. Yet the next opportunity you do it again. And the next time you feel a tendency in a gravitational pull towards those old perfectionistic patterns you take it again and again suddenly you blazed yourself on nice little dirt path. And the more you begin to use this path that becomes clearer becomes more efficient more effective and suddenly it's spacious enough it's well traveled enough where you can pave a one lane road and then suddenly a two lane road and so on and so forth the more you use it next thing you know you've greased an entirely new eight lane highway the other one as crumble it's hard to use you don't even remember even how to get there as much. That's neuroplasticity at its core so again through memory reconciledation neuroplasticity and intentionally priming yourself to be in that theta brainwave state you have an opportunity to unlearn the core beliefs emotional states and behaviors that are keeping you stuck facilitating a pattern of you getting in your own way and when you learn them you can harness the energy. To build the beliefs and behaviors you need to achieve your potential to be the best version of yourself. And obviously I'm biased hypnosis changed my life I've shared that story before hypnosis is allowed me to have an indescribable impact on my clients lives professionally personally athletically healthily and everywhere in between. And if I'm correct this is the eighth episode that I've done here as part of the inner game of real estate success here on the keeping it real podcast and I want to just say thank you for listening to these episodes it's a treat getting to tune in connect with you every single month I'm grateful to DJ in the team for the opportunity to continue to good faith in me to show up and provide value every single month. So thank you for listening and as a thank you specific to DJ in the real estate community who candidly some of my favorite clients are real estate agents investors and brokers.
