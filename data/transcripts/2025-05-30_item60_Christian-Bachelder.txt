[00:01:12] Today's episode is brought to you by Corded.io.
[00:01:15] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:19] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:20] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:23] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:26] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:28] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:30] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:33] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:37] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:39] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:44] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:47] and I've hired over 2,000 agents.

[00:01:51] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:53] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:01:56] for each agent in your market
[00:01:58] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:01] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:03] but Corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:06] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:08] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:10] Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:12] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:16] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:18] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:20] and I use it every single day.

[00:02:47] Welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by Real Estate Agents.
[00:02:52] And for Real Estate Agents, my name is DJ Paris.
[00:02:54] I'm your guide and host and today is our monthly series,
[00:02:57] Learn with a Lender.
[00:02:59] We have Christian Batchelder here from the one brokerage.
[00:03:02] I'm going to tell you, by the way, before I introduce Christian,
[00:03:05] if you've heard of a little thing called bigger pockets,
[00:03:07] Christian and his partner, David Green,
[00:03:09] these guys basically were the face of bigger pockets.
[00:03:12] They were on the podcast.
[00:03:13] They were all over the forums and they
[00:03:15] got a lot of certainly notoriety and attention.
[00:03:20] They are considered experts in the field of Real Estate,
[00:03:23] particularly around Real Estate investing,
[00:03:25] also traditional loans too.
[00:03:27] And they created their own brokerage.
[00:03:29] But they have a, let me tell you,
[00:03:32] four about the one brokerage.
[00:03:34] Together with David Green, Christian co-founded the one brokerage.
[00:03:36] Team D get this fastest growing broker in the nation in 2021 and 2022.
[00:03:41] Ranked in the top 20 brokerages by funded loan volume.
[00:03:44] Christian is a UC Berkeley grad.
[00:03:46] He has a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering,
[00:03:48] but he hated the industry and wanted to get out of
[00:03:50] craft earning potential.
[00:03:51] He got into Real Estate with the help of a childhood family
[00:03:54] friend who had some success in the business and discovered.
[00:03:57] He had a knack for connecting with people and adding value to their
[00:03:59] mindsets, investments, and journeys.
[00:04:01] He has a licensed Real Estate insurance and mortgage broker.

[00:04:13] to how to buy your thousandth property with a focus on what markets
[00:04:17] to target, how to find the best loans,
[00:04:18] and how to protect one's investments with insurance policies
[00:04:21] and other forms of asset protection.
[00:04:23] This guest speaker purchased 15 properties in 12 months last year

[00:04:50] And that's the number one brokerage.com.
[00:04:53] I'll have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:04:54] Christian, welcome back.
[00:04:56] Absolutely. Happy to be here.
[00:04:58] Appreciate the introduction and all the kind of words.
[00:05:02] You are a very, very important person in this industry
[00:05:05] and we're grateful to have you.
[00:05:07] And we are here in the middle of a kind of a strange market.
[00:05:12] So I'd love to get your take again, our audience,
[00:05:16] you know, their REALTORS out there, they're working with buyers,
[00:05:18] as well as sellers.
[00:05:21] And want to kind of just know what's happening.
[00:05:24] Yeah, it's a weird time right now.
[00:05:27] Since I've been in the industry, this is,
[00:05:29] I've kind of pried myself my ability to time things,
[00:05:33] to target good opportunities, to give good advice on
[00:05:36] the past, present, and future of,
[00:05:38] you know, everything as simple as from where rates are going
[00:05:40] to, you know, wins a good time to buy, right?
[00:05:44] And right now is hard.
[00:05:46] You know, it seems like every single day,
[00:05:48] there's new news coming out, there's new, you know,
[00:05:50] whether it's tariffs or wars or, you know, everything in between.
[00:05:56] I mean, even today, you know, as we're recording this,
[00:05:59] it sounds like a, a federal judge sounds like they're blocking Trump's tariffs.
[00:06:06] I saw that.
[00:06:07] Yeah, deeming it unconstitutional and beyond the power of the presidency.
[00:06:12] Which is interesting because that's kind of everything
[00:06:14] that we've been expecting for the last two or three months here now
[00:06:16] that these things are going through.
[00:06:17] And obviously we're negotiating them and, you know,
[00:06:20] we'll see where that lands.
[00:06:21] But it sounds like it's potentially within the power of the courts
[00:06:24] to deem it unconstitutional.
[00:06:26] And if that's the case,
[00:06:27] all this kind of grandstanding has been for another.
[00:06:30] Right?
[00:06:31] So we'll see.
[00:06:31] I mean, that's brand new news as of today.
[00:06:33] We don't know how it will settle yet.
[00:06:36] But it's an interesting time.
[00:06:37] The markets react.
[00:06:39] A lot of stuff's going on that, you know,
[00:06:41] I'll break down a little bit here today to give
[00:06:42] a little bit more of like, you know, the everyday understanding to it.
[00:06:46] So, you know, agents and different service providers can, you know, sound smart
[00:06:50] when discussing this stuff.
[00:06:52] But this is what I do.
[00:06:54] I researched the market to give the best advice and guidance that I can
[00:06:57] to customers and our rural partners.
[00:06:59] Yeah.
[00:07:00] And you are often sought after for your,
[00:07:04] your interpretation of the market.
[00:07:06] And, you know, I think what I was thinking about today is we could just sort of go over
[00:07:10] what products are available right now.
[00:07:12] Like, what is out there?
[00:07:14] You are a guru in all things loans.
[00:07:17] So, yeah, let's just kind of go through a primer.
[00:07:21] Yeah.
[00:07:21] What I usually like to say is I break down basically all lending in the country
[00:07:26] into three main buckets we'll call them.
[00:07:29] 
[00:07:29] And it's basically split up based on how they're underwritten.
[00:07:33] You know, what the qualifying terms are on the low.
[00:07:36] And when you hear the word underwriting, that's what it means.
[00:07:37] It's reviewing the qualifications of either the person buying the house
[00:07:42] or the house being purchased, right?
[00:07:46] And those three buckets are separated.
[00:07:49] The first one, we can kind of call it a, we'll call it A paper loans or prime lending.
[00:07:55] A lot of people refer to it as.
[00:07:57] This encompasses the conforming space.
[00:08:00] So, if you guys have heard of like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, V.A. style loans,
[00:08:05] that's all in this bucket.
[00:08:07] That's where the person, the person buying the house, the borrower,
[00:08:11] is the primary source of the qualifications.
[00:08:14] So, your debt to income matters, your credit score matters,
[00:08:18] the funds that you use for your down payment matters,
[00:08:21] in some situations your experience matters.
[00:08:24] You know, you are the primary qualifying factor, right?
[00:08:30] That's where, you know, we need what I refer to as full documentation to underwrite.
[00:08:34] So, that's tax returns, pay stubs, the insurance policies, mortgage statements, the whole Shabay,
[00:08:41] right? And when you hear people complaining about how hard it is to get a mortgage,
[00:08:46] they're usually talking about loans in the conforming space, just because the documentation is heavy,
[00:08:53] right? Now, as a return for that heavy documentation, though, and the increased
[00:09:00] difficulty of qualifying, this is also the bucket that has the best terms.
[00:09:04] Right?
[00:09:07] Hold on.
[00:09:08] All right, sorry, I closed my window. It should be a...
[00:09:13] Sorry, I didn't get it.
[00:09:14] No problem.
[00:09:15] But yeah, what I was saying is, in return for the increased
[00:09:20] underwriting criteria, you typically get the best terms in this bucket of lending.
[00:09:24] By terms, I mean rate, you know, amortization, closing cost.
[00:09:29] So, what I usually tell people is, when you first start looking for a mortgage,
[00:09:34] check to see if you qualify conventionally, right? Let your lender look at your tax returns,
[00:09:39] let your lender look at your pay stubs. If you're self-employed, let them look at your business
[00:09:42] operations. Because even though you hear things like, you can't get a W2...
[00:09:48] Or you can't get a loan without a W2 job, that's not true. We do conventional, fully underwritten
[00:09:53] loans for business owners and real estate investors all the time. It is true that they are harder
[00:09:58] to qualify, but they're not possible. You just have to work with a lender that knows how to
[00:10:02] write them. And then you sometimes even have to transition to a different loan product,
[00:10:09] which kind of segues as perfectly into my bucket B, so to speak.
[00:10:13] Right? And we'll just call this non-conventional lending, or non-QM mortgages.
[00:10:19] Right? QM stands for qualified mortgage, just another word for conforming basically.
[00:10:23] But this bucket is... We'll call it the investor friendly bucket. Right? So, this is the bucket
[00:10:30] that allows you to be a little bit more flexible with your income sometimes. Right? It allows...
[00:10:36] You know, and it encompasses the loan products that probably a lot of people have heard of,
[00:10:40] DSCR loans is probably the pillar of this category. Right? But basically what it does is that
[00:10:46] they're still underwriting. There is still a underlying qualification calculation in the mortgage.
[00:10:53] So, it's not like a no-dock loan, right? It's an alt-dock loan. Right? So, instead of relying on
[00:11:02] things like your tax returns or your pay stubs or your full documentation, there's things like the
[00:11:08] DSCR loan where it pivots the qualification instead of on the person, it puts it on the property.
[00:11:13] So, basically, does your property cash flow? Right? That's a much easier thing to get approved.
[00:11:18] Right? You don't need tax returns. You don't need all the mess of documentation.
[00:11:22] Basically, we're saying if it makes dollars, it makes sense kind of thing. So, in other words,
[00:11:27] if it's going to make money, if there's a proven track record there, if it's a rental property,
[00:11:32] for example, then much easier to sort of... Because the math is there.
[00:11:36] That's exactly right. And you think of it from the lender's opinion, because remember,
[00:11:40] it's easy to just view it from the consumers side, right? Like, why won't a lender give me a loan
[00:11:45] or why are they doing these loans? Right? And you can look at it from the lender's point of view,
[00:11:49] and if I'm giving you money, and you're going to owe me whatever, $3,000 a month on a mortgage,
[00:11:54] but you have a property that rents for $4,000 a month, it makes sense that you're going to be able
[00:11:58] to pay that mortgage, right? You take $3,000 out of the $4,000 that you make every month, and you pay me my debt.
[00:12:04] Right? So, those are loans that banks are very happy to give. We do them all the time. DSCR loans are
[00:12:11] a big basis of our entire work that we do. It's a great loan product specifically catered for
[00:12:18] investors, obviously people who are pursuing cash-flowing properties. But what people forget is that
[00:12:23] the DSCR is only one type of loan. There's other alternative documentation loans that are very
[00:12:29] forgiving for business owners, real estate investors, entrepreneurs, typically people that don't make
[00:12:34] income in the clean cut ways that banks like to see. But there's still a lot of options for you.
[00:12:39] So, for instance, if a contractor, somebody who's typically paid in maybe chunks or very variable
[00:12:50] methods, they may get a big deposit in March and then not get paid in April. There's loan products
[00:12:57] that I'll call one out, the bank statement loan. It's a loan product that a lot of people
[00:13:02] doesn't know exist. What it does is that it takes the underwriting criteria of the more traditional
[00:13:09] loans that rely on your tax returns and all that, and it loosens the criteria a little bit.
[00:13:15] So, it gets a little bit more flexible. And what I mean by that is that that contractor
[00:13:22] may be motivated to reduce his taxable income on his tax returns. He'll write off that new F-150 he
[00:13:30] bought. He'll write off all of his tools and things that he needs to perform his trade.
[00:13:36] Right? Now, in truth, he probably makes more money than what he reports on his tax returns because
[00:13:43] he deducted a lot of his income. Well, traditionally, in the first bucket of lending that we talked
[00:13:49] about, when you do that, you deduct your way out of qualifying for a mortgage. Because what you're
[00:13:56] doing on your tax returns when you write off things, when you deduct things, you're decreasing
[00:14:00] the income that you made. Right? Well, with mortgages, I need income to qualify you. And you just
[00:14:06] took it all away with your write offs. Right? Which is why this second bucket of lending exists,
[00:14:12] and bank statement financing is most common because instead of going based on what ends up on your
[00:14:17] taxes, a bank statement lender will look at your call it last 12 months of bank statements and tell a
[00:14:24] very reoccurring story of what you make. Right? And we see the deposits in your bank account.
[00:14:32] You know, and every business kind of has similar operating expenses, you know,
[00:14:35] 30, 50 percent whatever of your income goes to expenses. But we're able to give you credit based
[00:14:41] on the money that we actually see you making instead of what you kind of finagle on your tax returns.
[00:14:47] Right? This happens to me when I refinance because I have an S corporation and I am technically
[00:14:53] an employee of my own company. However, I pay myself on paper, I pay myself a very minimal salary.
[00:15:02] So when I go to refinance, they have to look at everything. They have to look at all of my accounts
[00:15:07] to say, Oh, okay, I see what the business is earning. DJ owns the business and he has access to
[00:15:14] the capital. His actual income, his W2 is going to tell only a little piece of the story.
[00:15:21] That's exactly right. Yeah. And that's that's where a lot of people in a similar situation,
[00:15:25] you are really any business owner out there will run into that problem, right? That like in order
[00:15:30] to buy a house, I need to basically take no write offs and report this really high taxable in earnings.
[00:15:36] And as a result of that, get taxed, right? And you end up having to play this balancing game
[00:15:41] versus like not truly reporting your income or qualifying for a mortgage. And the nice thing about
[00:15:46] non-traditional financing, it allows you to get the best in both worlds. You can still write
[00:15:50] off your income and you don't have to get punished by not qualifying for a mortgage because of,
[00:15:54] right? These programs are out there. They're typically less frequently offered. So like, you can't
[00:16:00] walk into Chase and get a bank statement loan. They don't do them, right? But working with the
[00:16:04] lender that understands this product niche and has access to programs, you know, and people will be
[00:16:10] surprised. They're pretty competitive rates even compared to conventional lending. They're higher
[00:16:15] obviously because they're more forgiving. But they're still very competitive and they're still
[00:16:19] 30 year fixed rates, right? A lot of people still think, you know, pre-2008, this was the case,
[00:16:24] but a lot of these programs were adjustable rate mortgages and, you know, balloon periods and,
[00:16:30] you know, really like subprime loans. And that's not the case anymore. You can get these non-conventional
[00:16:35] loans on 30 year fixed rates, you know, without balloon payments and all the negative aspects that
[00:16:41] historically, you know, before these loan products changed, those negative aspects were
[00:16:45] associated one to one with these loans. And they're not anymore. And a lot of people don't know it.
[00:16:49] Right? Knowing what access to financing you have can be the maker break to your next deal
[00:16:56] working or not working. Right? Financing is such an important part of the process.
[00:17:02] But yeah, we'll keep going. So we discuss bucket A. We discuss bucket B. Bucket C is kind of my
[00:17:08] catch all, right? And this is where you guys can see as I'm going through these three buckets,
[00:17:13] I'm going from the most strict criteria, but also the best terms to bucket B, little bit
[00:17:21] loosening criteria, little bit worse terms, still 30 year fixed, still good rates. The third bucket,
[00:17:28] we go to the other extreme, which is the lowest underwriting criteria, but the highest term. So like
[00:17:34] the less competitive interest rates, the higher closing costs. And this is when you start to get into
[00:17:40] the hard money lending sector, the private money, the renovation lending, the bridge lending,
[00:17:47] all of the kind of lending that really I wouldn't recommend unless you kind of know what you're doing.
[00:17:53] Right? Because these are loans that are 10 to 13% interest rate sometimes. Right?
[00:17:57] Right. And a lot of people would say, why would anybody do that? Well, it makes sense a lot. And
[00:18:02] let me give an example. I used one of these loans. And let me just give you a breakdown of a
[00:18:10] sample of the case. So I bought a house, I believe 350,000 was my purchase price.
[00:18:16] Beat crap is in rough shape. Total needed some, you know, I always laugh when agents put on the
[00:18:23] MLS. Contractors dream. Yeah, it's not a contractor dream. It's just a house that's been,
[00:18:32] you know, beat up. Right? But bought it significantly below market. Right? I needed a lot of work.
[00:18:37] It was a hoarder house. You know, needed, needed complete love. Right?
[00:18:43] Bought it. I used a bridge loan that financed my acquisition and my renovation. I spent 100 grand
[00:18:51] renovating it. So I'm all in 350 and 100 all in for a project cost of 450. Right? I targeted
[00:18:58] this property really well because I got an appraisal, what's called an ARV appraisal. Those who are
[00:19:04] familiar, that stands for after a pair of values. So basically, getting somebody to tell me what it's
[00:19:08] going to be worth after my renovations are complete. And it was 700,000. So for an all-in cost of 450,
[00:19:16] I have an asset that after the fact is going to be worth 700. That's an incredible return. Right?
[00:19:20] Same. This is a unique opportunity, right? We, the seller really needed to sell and they were
[00:19:25] willing to take less. So it's a good opportunity. But also need a lot of work. A hundred grand of
[00:19:30] renovation on a 300 grand house is significant. Right? So obviously we did it. The nice part
[00:19:37] is that I got with a contractor. We put together a plan. We got in touch with the city
[00:19:43] permitting department and got an estimation of how long it would take to do everything. And we
[00:19:48] determined four months is what it would take, which is a pretty quick turn time for a flip.
[00:19:52] Yeah. Right? There's professional. I'm not a professional flipper. There's professional flippers
[00:19:56] that could probably have done this in a month. That's not me. Right? I'm not at the house hammer in
[00:20:01] the nails into the wall. Right? Sure. But I got a hard money loan that financed 90% of my project cost.
[00:20:10] So out of that 450,000, I only parted with $45,000. Okay? Do that math. I ended up with a 700,000
[00:20:19] dollar property. So that's less than what, that's almost 5% down at the end of the day, right? But
[00:20:24] it gets better. It gets better. We did the renovation and let's assume I got a little bit lower
[00:20:31] rate in this, but let's just assume it's a 12% rate for easy math. 12% on your mortgage rate is
[00:20:37] the interest that you pay over the course of a year. That's a really high rate, right? Market rate
[00:20:42] at the time was probably a 6% on regular mortgages, right? So I'm getting a rate double that.
[00:20:48] But when you think about it, I didn't hold the loan for six months. I got it done in four.
[00:20:56] Well, if I'm paying 12% annual, that basically breaks down to 1% per month. Kind of, right? Yeah.
[00:21:02] 1% per month, I only held it for four months. Well, in my mind, I borrowed hard money debt for
[00:21:07] 4% interest because I only held it for once. Right? After that four month period was over,
[00:21:13] I had a house that, believe it or not, appraised for $700,000 once we renovated it. Well, what I did
[00:21:20] was I went and did a cash out refinance. And just doing some math here, I was doing it on my
[00:21:24] computer, 700,000. I need one more year. I held 700,000 times. I did a 75% refinance. Sometimes 0.75
[00:21:33] is $525,000 loan. Well, I was all in for $450,000 and I only parted with $45,000 at a pocket.
[00:21:46] Well, now I'm getting a takeout loan and I did a DSCR loan. So going back to our second bucket,
[00:21:52] I started in bucket C came back to bucket B, right? Right. And I ended with a 30-year rate that was
[00:21:59] whatever 6.75, whatever it was. But the important part is out of the first loan that I had,
[00:22:06] which we just do the math here, right? So I had a $450,000 project and I put 10% down.
[00:22:12] So that's a $405,000 loan. Yeah. I took a cash out of $525,000. So $525,000, I had to pay off
[00:22:23] my $405,000 hard money loan. So I made $120,000 at the exit of my deal. While I still own the property.
[00:22:33] Well, I was in the property for $45,000. So if I subtract that from what I just take out,
[00:22:39] I made $75,000 buying a property. That is insane. Yeah. Now it's a producing short-term
[00:22:47] rental for me that I have roughly a $500,000 mortgage on. I think my monthly payments like
[00:22:53] $39,000, $40,000 right around that last month it made $9,000. Oh my gosh. So I made $75,000,
[00:23:01] buying a property took $4,000. And you're getting $45,000 a month.
[00:23:05] Some people would call me crazy for having a 12% interest rate. Well, I got it back down to 6,
[00:23:11] on a 30-year fixed rate. I have a property that has the capacity of generating $9,000,000 a month,
[00:23:15] and it's costing me four grand a month. I don't know what the listeners live in, but in my world,
[00:23:21] that's a win. That includes origination fees and all sorts of things. It doesn't matter. You're still
[00:23:29] netting in sane amounts of money. 100%. And that's when you combine these programs, the nice thing
[00:23:36] about what we've built with the one brokerage and not to be just a shameless plug. But a lot of times
[00:23:41] you'd have to go to a bunch of different lenders to implement a strategy like this. You'd have to go
[00:23:44] to a hard money lender and then go to a bank to buy your primary and then go to a credit union
[00:23:49] to get your HELOC and then go to a broker to get a DSCR loan. We create a place that does everything.
[00:23:56] Every loan that I've talked about here today and I haven't even addressed what I'll call like the
[00:24:01] fourth bucket. I know I told you there was three, but the fourth bucket's commercial. That's if you
[00:24:04] want to buy like a 100-unit apartment complex or a warehouse or a gas station, right? We do that too.
[00:24:10] So no matter what financing structure, if you could go to one place and they can build a strategy like
[00:24:16] the one that I just walked through and you never have to talk to anybody else, like that's pretty
[00:24:21] cool, right? Because what I would have done, let's play this out. My 350K purchase and 100K
[00:24:29] right now, I'm all in for 450. What if all of the houses in that neighborhood instead of my
[00:24:36] after-apparevalu being 700? What if there was no property in the market selling for more than 400?
[00:24:43] So I'm buying for 350, which is a good deal. I'm getting 50K below market, but it takes 100K to get
[00:24:48] it to market standards. But there's no houses that sell for 450. Maybe you say, oh, I'm going to build
[00:24:54] the nicest one. Okay, even if it prays for 450, that's what I'm in for. So there's no gain there.
[00:25:00] There's nothing to win. If I was a hard money lender, I would have still given you that loan.
[00:25:05] Because I don't care about your exit. I just care about getting you in.
[00:25:09] I do the long-term financing as well. So I know I wouldn't have been able to get you that loan for
[00:25:14] the 30-year fixed because there's not enough property value there. So I would have killed that deal.
[00:25:20] And I would have prevented that borrower from getting into a situation where you're over leveraged.
[00:25:25] You have a house that is not worth what you spent on it at the end of the day.
[00:25:29] And it's probably not going to be a win, right? And even though that would have cost me a hard
[00:25:34] money loan, it wins me the better advice to the client at the end of the day. That's why my
[00:25:41] opinion is important to have a lender that works both sides of the transaction because they could
[00:25:46] be an added layer of a failsafe, so to speak, to prevent you from potentially getting too far
[00:25:53] down the wrong path. This is so interesting to me. And this is why you have the reputation you have
[00:26:02] because you are able to creatively structure short-term and long-term goals and integrate them.
[00:26:09] And I think that is a unique, when we think about lenders, we think about lenders being very short-term
[00:26:16] focused. They're transactional, just like real estate agents. They get paid on the close.
[00:26:25] However, as real estate agents, we need to be investing in properties ourselves. This is our business.
[00:26:30] And this is an opportunity for everyone out there who isn't currently working with investors
[00:26:35] or isn't an investor themselves to consider adding this into your arsenal. You know,
[00:26:42] Christian is the guy to talk to. He is brokerage, the one brokerage, incredible. They are really,
[00:26:48] they're the real deal and we love them. The onebrokerage.com is where you go to learn. Please
[00:26:54] reach out to them. They want your business and they can do everything from traditional mortgages
[00:26:58] all the way to hard money lending and alternative products. And he's going to structure deals
[00:27:05] for you that he structures for himself. That's what's so cool. And this is why Christian and David
[00:27:11] have created this amazing company and they're one of the fastest growing brokerages in the nation
[00:27:16] for mortgages because they are so skilled. These are the guys that built up biggerpockets.com.
[00:27:22] They are the face of, they were the face of it and now they're off doing their own thing,
[00:27:26] which is even more incredible that we get to say hi to Christian once a month.

[00:27:40] it could even be a primary residence. Give them a chat. Go to the one, the number one brokerage.com.

I'm your guide and host and today is our monthly series, Learn with a Lender. We have Christian Batchelder here from the one brokerage. I'm going to tell you, by the way, before I introduce Christian, if you've heard of a little thing called bigger pockets, Christian and his partner, David Green, these guys basically were the face of bigger pockets. They were on the podcast. They were all over the forums and they got a lot of certainly notoriety and attention. They are considered experts in the field of Real Estate, particularly around Real Estate investing, also traditional loans too. And they created their own brokerage. But they have a, let me tell you, four about the one brokerage. Together with David Green, Christian co-founded the one brokerage.

Christian, welcome back. Absolutely. Happy to be here. Appreciate the introduction and all the kind of words. You are a very, very important person in this industry and we're grateful to have you. And we are here in the middle of a kind of a strange market. So I'd love to get your take again, our audience, you know, their REALTORS out there, they're working with buyers, as well as sellers. And want to kind of just know what's happening. Yeah, it's a weird time right now. Since I've been in the industry, this is, I've kind of pried myself my ability to time things, to target good opportunities, to give good advice on the past, present, and future of, you know, everything as simple as from where rates are going to, you know, wins a good time to buy, right? And right now is hard. You know, it seems like every single day, there's new news coming out, there's new, you know, whether it's tariffs or wars or, you know, everything in between. I mean, even today, you know, as we're recording this, it sounds like a, a federal judge sounds like they're blocking Trump's tariffs. I saw that. Yeah, deeming it unconstitutional and beyond the power of the presidency. Which is interesting because that's kind of everything that we've been expecting for the last two or three months here now that these things are going through. And obviously we're negotiating them and, you know, we'll see where that lands. But it sounds like it's potentially within the power of the courts to deem it unconstitutional. And if that's the case, all this kind of grandstanding has been for another. Right? So we'll see. I mean, that's brand new news as of today. We don't know how it will settle yet. But it's an interesting time. The markets react. A lot of stuff's going on that, you know, I'll break down a little bit here today to give a little bit more of like, you know, the everyday understanding to it. So, you know, agents and different service providers can, you know, sound smart when discussing this stuff. But this is what I do. I researched the market to give the best advice and guidance that I can to customers and our rural partners. Yeah. And you are often sought after for your, your interpretation of the market. And, you know, I think what I was thinking about today is we could just sort of go over what products are available right now. Like, what is out there? You are a guru in all things loans. So, yeah, let's just kind of go through a primer. Yeah. What I usually like to say is I break down basically all lending in the country into three main buckets we'll call them. And it's basically split up based on how they're underwritten. You know, what the qualifying terms are on the low. And when you hear the word underwriting, that's what it means. It's reviewing the qualifications of either the person buying the house or the house being purchased, right? And those three buckets are separated. The first one, we can kind of call it a, we'll call it A paper loans or prime lending. A lot of people refer to it as. This encompasses the conforming space. So, if you guys have heard of like Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, FHA, V.A. style loans, that's all in this bucket. That's where the person, the person buying the house, the borrower, is the primary source of the qualifications. So, your debt to income matters, your credit score matters, the funds that you use for your down payment matters, in some situations your experience matters. You know, you are the primary qualifying factor, right? That's where, you know, we need what I refer to as full documentation to underwrite. So, that's tax returns, pay stubs, the insurance policies, mortgage statements, the whole Shabay, right? And when you hear people complaining about how hard it is to get a mortgage, they're usually talking about loans in the conforming space, just because the documentation is heavy, right? Now, as a return for that heavy documentation, though, and the increased difficulty of qualifying, this is also the bucket that has the best terms. Right? Hold on. All right, sorry, I closed my window. It should be a... Sorry, I didn't get it. No problem. But yeah, what I was saying is, in return for the increased underwriting criteria, you typically get the best terms in this bucket of lending. By terms, I mean rate, you know, amortization, closing cost. So, what I usually tell people is, when you first start looking for a mortgage, check to see if you qualify conventionally, right? Let your lender look at your tax returns, let your lender look at your pay stubs. If you're self-employed, let them look at your business operations. Because even though you hear things like, you can't get a W2... Or you can't get a loan without a W2 job, that's not true. We do conventional, fully underwritten loans for business owners and real estate investors all the time. It is true that they are harder to qualify, but they're not possible. You just have to work with a lender that knows how to write them. And then you sometimes even have to transition to a different loan product, which kind of segues as perfectly into my bucket B, so to speak. Right? And we'll just call this non-conventional lending, or non-QM mortgages. Right? QM stands for qualified mortgage, just another word for conforming basically. But this bucket is... We'll call it the investor friendly bucket. Right? So, this is the bucket that allows you to be a little bit more flexible with your income sometimes. Right? It allows... You know, and it encompasses the loan products that probably a lot of people have heard of, DSCR loans is probably the pillar of this category. Right? But basically what it does is that they're still underwriting. There is still a underlying qualification calculation in the mortgage. So, it's not like a no-dock loan, right? It's an alt-dock loan. Right? So, instead of relying on things like your tax returns or your pay stubs or your full documentation, there's things like the DSCR loan where it pivots the qualification instead of on the person, it puts it on the property. So, basically, does your property cash flow? Right? That's a much easier thing to get approved. Right? You don't need tax returns. You don't need all the mess of documentation. Basically, we're saying if it makes dollars, it makes sense kind of thing. So, in other words, if it's going to make money, if there's a proven track record there, if it's a rental property, for example, then much easier to sort of... Because the math is there. That's exactly right. And you think of it from the lender's opinion, because remember, it's easy to just view it from the consumers side, right? Like, why won't a lender give me a loan or why are they doing these loans? Right? And you can look at it from the lender's point of view, and if I'm giving you money, and you're going to owe me whatever, $3,000 a month on a mortgage, but you have a property that rents for $4,000 a month, it makes sense that you're going to be able to pay that mortgage, right? You take $3,000 out of the $4,000 that you make every month, and you pay me my debt. Right? So, those are loans that banks are very happy to give. We do them all the time. DSCR loans are a big basis of our entire work that we do. It's a great loan product specifically catered for investors, obviously people who are pursuing cash-flowing properties. But what people forget is that the DSCR is only one type of loan. There's other alternative documentation loans that are very forgiving for business owners, real estate investors, entrepreneurs, typically people that don't make income in the clean cut ways that banks like to see. But there's still a lot of options for you. So, for instance, if a contractor, somebody who's typically paid in maybe chunks or very variable methods, they may get a big deposit in March and then not get paid in April. There's loan products that I'll call one out, the bank statement loan. It's a loan product that a lot of people doesn't know exist. What it does is that it takes the underwriting criteria of the more traditional loans that rely on your tax returns and all that, and it loosens the criteria a little bit. So, it gets a little bit more flexible. And what I mean by that is that that contractor may be motivated to reduce his taxable income on his tax returns. He'll write off that new F-150 he bought. He'll write off all of his tools and things that he needs to perform his trade. Right? Now, in truth, he probably makes more money than what he reports on his tax returns because he deducted a lot of his income. Well, traditionally, in the first bucket of lending that we talked about, when you do that, you deduct your way out of qualifying for a mortgage. Because what you're doing on your tax returns when you write off things, when you deduct things, you're decreasing the income that you made. Right? Well, with mortgages, I need income to qualify you. And you just took it all away with your write offs. Right? Which is why this second bucket of lending exists, and bank statement financing is most common because instead of going based on what ends up on your taxes, a bank statement lender will look at your call it last 12 months of bank statements and tell a very reoccurring story of what you make. Right? And we see the deposits in your bank account. You know, and every business kind of has similar operating expenses, you know, 30, 50 percent whatever of your income goes to expenses. But we're able to give you credit based on the money that we actually see you making instead of what you kind of finagle on your tax returns. Right? This happens to me when I refinance because I have an S corporation and I am technically an employee of my own company. However, I pay myself on paper, I pay myself a very minimal salary. So when I go to refinance, they have to look at everything. They have to look at all of my accounts to say, Oh, okay, I see what the business is earning. DJ owns the business and he has access to the capital. His actual income, his W2 is going to tell only a little piece of the story. That's exactly right. Yeah. And that's that's where a lot of people in a similar situation, you are really any business owner out there will run into that problem, right? That like in order to buy a house, I need to basically take no write offs and report this really high taxable in earnings. And as a result of that, get taxed, right? And you end up having to play this balancing game versus like not truly reporting your income or qualifying for a mortgage. And the nice thing about non-traditional financing, it allows you to get the best in both worlds. You can still write off your income and you don't have to get punished by not qualifying for a mortgage because of, right? These programs are out there. They're typically less frequently offered. So like, you can't walk into Chase and get a bank statement loan. They don't do them, right? But working with the lender that understands this product niche and has access to programs, you know, and people will be surprised. They're pretty competitive rates even compared to conventional lending. They're higher obviously because they're more forgiving. But they're still very competitive and they're still 30 year fixed rates, right? A lot of people still think, you know, pre-2008, this was the case, but a lot of these programs were adjustable rate mortgages and, you know, balloon periods and, you know, really like subprime loans. And that's not the case anymore. You can get these non-conventional loans on 30 year fixed rates, you know, without balloon payments and all the negative aspects that historically, you know, before these loan products changed, those negative aspects were associated one to one with these loans. And they're not anymore. And a lot of people don't know it. Right? Knowing what access to financing you have can be the maker break to your next deal working or not working. Right? Financing is such an important part of the process. But yeah, we'll keep going. So we discuss bucket A. We discuss bucket B. Bucket C is kind of my catch all, right? And this is where you guys can see as I'm going through these three buckets, I'm going from the most strict criteria, but also the best terms to bucket B, little bit loosening criteria, little bit worse terms, still 30 year fixed, still good rates. The third bucket, we go to the other extreme, which is the lowest underwriting criteria, but the highest term. So like the less competitive interest rates, the higher closing costs. And this is when you start to get into the hard money lending sector, the private money, the renovation lending, the bridge lending, all of the kind of lending that really I wouldn't recommend unless you kind of know what you're doing. Right? Because these are loans that are 10 to 13% interest rate sometimes. Right? Right. And a lot of people would say, why would anybody do that? Well, it makes sense a lot. And let me give an example. I used one of these loans. And let me just give you a breakdown of a sample of the case. So I bought a house, I believe 350,000 was my purchase price. Beat crap is in rough shape. Total needed some, you know, I always laugh when agents put on the MLS. Contractors dream. Yeah, it's not a contractor dream. It's just a house that's been, you know, beat up. Right? But bought it significantly below market. Right? I needed a lot of work. It was a hoarder house. You know, needed, needed complete love. Right? Bought it. I used a bridge loan that financed my acquisition and my renovation. I spent 100 grand renovating it. So I'm all in 350 and 100 all in for a project cost of 450. Right? I targeted this property really well because I got an appraisal, what's called an ARV appraisal. Those who are familiar, that stands for after a pair of values. So basically, getting somebody to tell me what it's going to be worth after my renovations are complete. And it was 700,000. So for an all-in cost of 450, I have an asset that after the fact is going to be worth 700. That's an incredible return. Right? Same. This is a unique opportunity, right? We, the seller really needed to sell and they were willing to take less. So it's a good opportunity. But also need a lot of work. A hundred grand of renovation on a 300 grand house is significant. Right? So obviously we did it. The nice part is that I got with a contractor. We put together a plan. We got in touch with the city permitting department and got an estimation of how long it would take to do everything. And we determined four months is what it would take, which is a pretty quick turn time for a flip. Yeah. Right? There's professional. I'm not a professional flipper. There's professional flippers that could probably have done this in a month. That's not me. Right? I'm not at the house hammer in the nails into the wall. Right? Sure. But I got a hard money loan that financed 90% of my project cost. So out of that 450,000, I only parted with $45,000. Okay? Do that math. I ended up with a 700,000 dollar property. So that's less than what, that's almost 5% down at the end of the day, right? But it gets better. It gets better. We did the renovation and let's assume I got a little bit lower rate in this, but let's just assume it's a 12% rate for easy math. 12% on your mortgage rate is the interest that you pay over the course of a year. That's a really high rate, right? Market rate at the time was probably a 6% on regular mortgages, right? So I'm getting a rate double that. But when you think about it, I didn't hold the loan for six months. I got it done in four. Well, if I'm paying 12% annual, that basically breaks down to 1% per month. Kind of, right? Yeah. 1% per month, I only held it for four months. Well, in my mind, I borrowed hard money debt for 4% interest because I only held it for once. Right? After that four month period was over, I had a house that, believe it or not, appraised for $700,000 once we renovated it. Well, what I did was I went and did a cash out refinance. And just doing some math here, I was doing it on my computer, 700,000. I need one more year. I held 700,000 times. I did a 75% refinance. Sometimes 0.75 is $525,000 loan. Well, I was all in for $450,000 and I only parted with $45,000 at a pocket. Well, now I'm getting a takeout loan and I did a DSCR loan. So going back to our second bucket, I started in bucket C came back to bucket B, right? Right. And I ended with a 30-year rate that was whatever 6.75, whatever it was. But the important part is out of the first loan that I had, which we just do the math here, right? So I had a $450,000 project and I put 10% down. So that's a $405,000 loan. Yeah. I took a cash out of $525,000. So $525,000, I had to pay off my $405,000 hard money loan. So I made $120,000 at the exit of my deal. While I still own the property. Well, I was in the property for $45,000. So if I subtract that from what I just take out, I made $75,000 buying a property. That is insane. Yeah. Now it's a producing short-term rental for me that I have roughly a $500,000 mortgage on. I think my monthly payments like $39,000, $40,000 right around that last month it made $9,000. Oh my gosh. So I made $75,000, buying a property took $4,000. And you're getting $45,000 a month. Some people would call me crazy for having a 12% interest rate. Well, I got it back down to 6, on a 30-year fixed rate. I have a property that has the capacity of generating $9,000,000 a month, and it's costing me four grand a month. I don't know what the listeners live in, but in my world, that's a win. That includes origination fees and all sorts of things. It doesn't matter. You're still netting in sane amounts of money. 100%. And that's when you combine these programs, the nice thing about what we've built with the one brokerage and not to be just a shameless plug. But a lot of times you'd have to go to a bunch of different lenders to implement a strategy like this. You'd have to go to a hard money lender and then go to a bank to buy your primary and then go to a credit union to get your HELOC and then go to a broker to get a DSCR loan. We create a place that does everything. Every loan that I've talked about here today and I haven't even addressed what I'll call like the fourth bucket. I know I told you there was three, but the fourth bucket's commercial. That's if you want to buy like a 100-unit apartment complex or a warehouse or a gas station, right? We do that too. So no matter what financing structure, if you could go to one place and they can build a strategy like the one that I just walked through and you never have to talk to anybody else, like that's pretty cool, right? Because what I would have done, let's play this out. My 350K purchase and 100K right now, I'm all in for 450. What if all of the houses in that neighborhood instead of my after-apparevalu being 700? What if there was no property in the market selling for more than 400? So I'm buying for 350, which is a good deal. I'm getting 50K below market, but it takes 100K to get it to market standards. But there's no houses that sell for 450. Maybe you say, oh, I'm going to build the nicest one. Okay, even if it prays for 450, that's what I'm in for. So there's no gain there. There's nothing to win. If I was a hard money lender, I would have still given you that loan. Because I don't care about your exit. I just care about getting you in. I do the long-term financing as well. So I know I wouldn't have been able to get you that loan for the 30-year fixed because there's not enough property value there. So I would have killed that deal. And I would have prevented that borrower from getting into a situation where you're over leveraged. You have a house that is not worth what you spent on it at the end of the day. And it's probably not going to be a win, right? And even though that would have cost me a hard money loan, it wins me the better advice to the client at the end of the day. That's why my opinion is important to have a lender that works both sides of the transaction because they could be an added layer of a failsafe, so to speak, to prevent you from potentially getting too far down the wrong path. This is so interesting to me. And this is why you have the reputation you have because you are able to creatively structure short-term and long-term goals and integrate them. And I think that is a unique, when we think about lenders, we think about lenders being very short-term focused. They're transactional, just like real estate agents. They get paid on the close. However, as real estate agents, we need to be investing in properties ourselves. This is our business. And this is an opportunity for everyone out there who isn't currently working with investors or isn't an investor themselves to consider adding this into your arsenal.
