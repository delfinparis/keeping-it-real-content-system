[00:01:15] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:19] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:22] Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:27] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:30] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:32] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:35] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:41] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:46] to leave you?
[00:01:48] Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:52] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:57] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:02] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:05] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:10] read everything I offer.
[00:02:11] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:17] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:20] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:22] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:26] Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:05:54] All right, enjoy the episode.
[00:06:09] What is the best piece of advice that you've ever received as a real spending?
[00:06:15] I think the best piece of advice is probably like be aware of who you surround yourself
[00:06:20] with.
[00:06:21] Because I think like getting into business in 2012 where there's like short sales and
[00:06:25] RIOs and it's like a really challenging market.
[00:06:28] Everybody in my market was like, there's no listings, like the market sucks.
[00:06:31] And I was like, yeah, there's no listings and market sucks.
[00:06:33] But it was like, if I wanted to be a top agent and change my life, that mindset wasn't
[00:06:38] going to get me anywhere.
[00:06:39] And so I really had to like edit my peer group and be super intentional.
[00:06:42] And like, I, you know, I just heard that thing like you never want to be the smartest person
[00:06:47] in the room.
[00:06:47] And so I was like, okay, like, who can I surround myself with that is doing what I want to
[00:06:51] do at a super high level.
[00:06:52] But that also has a priority straight.
[00:06:55] And so that was a really big thing for me.
[00:06:58] And it also was like sometimes like my biggest mentors, I'd never even met them.
[00:07:03] They run a podcast or, you know, they wrote a book, but it's like that can be your mentor
[00:07:08] if you let it be, you know?
[00:07:11] Love it.
[00:07:12] And what's the worst piece of advice you've ever received?
[00:07:17] Yeah, gosh, there's a lot of really bad advice out there.
[00:07:22] I think one of the biggest things is like you're like encouraged to buy leads.
[00:07:30] Like they don't tell you how important it is to like really get your skill set dialed.
[00:07:35] I know a lot of agents are like, oh, I just want business.
[00:07:37] And they're like, I'll just take like, I'll get leads.
[00:07:39] And like, to me, buying leads is like the easy way out.
[00:07:42] It's like they come to you.
[00:07:43] But if you don't have your scripts dialed and your objection handlers mastered,
[00:07:48] like you can't convert that script that lead for crap.
[00:07:51] And so like I think, I really think like if I'm working with a new agent,
[00:07:55] I'm like, I want you to think of your business like the legs of a chair.
[00:07:57] Is this four legs to a chair that hold up the chair that give it a really strong foundation?
[00:08:01] That needs to be like the legs of your business.
[00:08:04] And by that, I mean like the legs of your lead generation chair,
[00:08:06] the way you're going to generate leads.
[00:08:07] And so I'm like, okay, database 100%.
[00:08:10] Every single REALTOR has people who like them, who love them, who want to refer business.
[00:08:13] But then the second third and fourth legs different for everybody.
[00:08:17] And I think you really do have to try doorknoc.
[00:08:19] And you have to try open houses.
[00:08:21] You have to try dialing.
[00:08:22] You have to try business to business relationships.
[00:08:25] And you know, all the different types of lead generation to figure out
[00:08:27] like what really resonates with you.
[00:08:30] And when you do this well, it doesn't feel like work.
[00:08:33] You're not like, oh gosh, I have to pick up the phone.
[00:08:35] And you're like, cool, who do I get to meet today?
[00:08:37] So I think that's probably my biggest, the worst mistake I made was
[00:08:42] paying for leads in the very beginning when I didn't have any money.
[00:08:45] And every month I was reminded of my bad choices because it was just drafting out of my account.
[00:08:49] And I was like, dang it.
[00:08:52] Our guest today, welcoming back her back to the show, the amazing Rachel Adams,
[00:08:58] Lee, I'm going to tell you more about Rachel.
[00:09:00] She's a coach.
[00:09:01] She's an top agent.
[00:09:03] She's, gosh, she does everything.
[00:09:05] She's on a lot of podcasts as well.
[00:09:07] And let me tell you more about her.
[00:09:09] If you missed her the first time, she was so good.
[00:09:11] She's back.
[00:09:12] So today, Rachel Adams, Lee from Keller Williams real estate in Northern California,
[00:09:17] is going to talk about social media strategies, including how to grow your
[00:09:23] following and beat the algorithm.
[00:09:24] But let me tell you more about her.
[00:09:26] She is a small town girl making big moves.
[00:09:29] She's a top 1000 REALTOR in the US, multi passionate entrepreneur and boy mama of three.
[00:09:36] By the way, she also runs six and seven figure companies with her husband and lives
[00:09:41] life on their terms on her terms.
[00:09:44] She loves helping others tap into their true potential and build the business of their dreams.
[00:09:49] Fun facts, positivity is her jam.
[00:09:52] You can find her snuggle on the couch in yoga pants, hair in a messy bun with her laptop.
[00:09:56] She's only five feet tall.
[00:09:58] She loves all things social media obsessed with having a healthy marriage.
[00:10:01] What a great thing to be obsessed about.
[00:10:03] And things Nutella should be its own food group.
[00:10:07] My girlfriend would agree.
[00:10:08] All right.
[00:10:09] So when everybody to follow Rachel, she has an unbelievable social media following on Instagram
[00:10:15] at Rachel Adams, Lee will have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:10:19] Rachel, welcome back again to the show.
[00:10:21] Thank you.
[00:10:22] Thanks for having me.
[00:10:23] I was excited when you guys asked.
[00:10:25] I am excited always to talk to you because you just have so much to say.
[00:10:29] And the things you say, our audience really appreciates.
[00:10:32] So we normally go through and say, how did you get into real estate?
[00:10:35] But you already did that.
[00:10:36] And let's just like jump into sort of what our audience really wants to hear is sort of what you're doing now.
[00:10:43] Because I think this is a tough market.
[00:10:46] At least here, I'm in Chicago, you're in Northern California.
[00:10:50] I assume it's similar ish where not as many listings rates are still, of course, where they're at.
[00:10:55] And agents are a lot of buyers who were locked into a, sorry, a lot of sellers, sorry, a lot of homeowners.
[00:11:01] Let me rephrase that homeowners who are locked into like a 3% mortgage and don't necessarily want to move.
[00:11:07] Because who wants to give up a 3% mortgage.
[00:11:10] So you have just not a whole lot of inventory out there.
[00:11:12] But the buyers who are out there, not much to choose from and rates are still high.
[00:11:18] So what are we doing or what are you telling you have?
[00:11:22] Number one, you run a huge team, an amazing team, and you also coach agents all over the country.
[00:11:28] So what are you telling people to do right now?
[00:11:31] So it really is like it's not sexy, but it's like get back to the basics.
[00:11:36] Because when the market shifts, like I, you know, I've been in it since 2012.
[00:11:40] Like there was RIOs, there were short sales.
[00:11:42] Like that's what I started with.
[00:11:44] So I only knew hard.
[00:11:45] And so lean generating for me and like it was a volume based business where I had to have X amount of calls.
[00:11:51] I had not had enough this many doors before I'd get the conversion.
[00:11:54] And you know, I started my business doing door knocking open houses.
[00:11:57] I knock 200 doors every week and it three open houses every week.
[00:12:00] Like every single week.
[00:12:02] And I was practicing script seven days a week.
[00:12:04] So like I didn't have any money.
[00:12:06] I didn't have a client base.
[00:12:07] Like I was brand new to the business.
[00:12:09] But what I had was like my drive.
[00:12:11] And I was super committed to like making things happen.
[00:12:14] I wanted to change my life, right?
[00:12:16] I was in a really unhealthy marriage in the beginning of my career.
[00:12:18] And I just like I wanted a totally different life than what I currently had.
[00:12:22] And so that means I had to show up differently.
[00:12:25] And so what that looked like for me was, you know,
[00:12:28] I so I hustle.
[00:12:30] I work really hard that first year.
[00:12:32] I'm knocking 200 doors doing three open houses.
[00:12:34] And I ain't selling homes for the first four months.
[00:12:37] So in those four months, I just remember like crying a lot,
[00:12:39] questioning my life choices, drinking a lot of wine.
[00:12:42] But then I was like, okay, what do I want to look like?
[00:12:45] And I kept doing the right thing.
[00:12:46] And I think that's the biggest thing right now is like you're going to get discouraged.
[00:12:50] It's going to take more calls, more knocks, more posts,
[00:12:53] you know, more open houses than you're used to to convert those clients.
[00:12:56] And when you stay consistent with it and you have really good follow-up systems,
[00:13:01] that's when the conversion happens because I didn't sell any homes for the first four months.
[00:13:04] But I sold 39 my first year.
[00:13:07] That it was 19, that it was 123.
[00:13:10] And you know, it's only grown the business from there.
[00:13:13] And I've always wanted to be a wife and a mom.
[00:13:16] That is like hands down like my dream was always to be a wife and a mom.
[00:13:20] And so I knew that like when I got to that stage,
[00:13:22] I wouldn't be able to knock that many doors and do got many open houses with a newborn.
[00:13:26] Right, like that wouldn't work out.
[00:13:27] And so I was like, what would this need to look like?
[00:13:30] And so for me, what it looked like was transitioning to social media.
[00:13:34] I wanted to lead generation lover that I could turn on when I wanted to work and turn off when I didn't.
[00:13:40] And you know, that social media has changed the game for me.
[00:13:43] So what I focus on now is, you know, I have my real estate team.
[00:13:47] And in fact, when we're done with this call, I am running my team meeting.
[00:13:52] And today's entire team meeting is about database and follow-up.
[00:13:55] They're not sexy stuff.
[00:13:56] The stuff that people are like, I don't want to make those calls or I'm not saying this.
[00:14:00] But reality is, you know, I did a deep dive into our CRM
[00:14:04] and realized that we have a lot of opportunities there.
[00:14:06] And so I'm going to kick my agents butt today.
[00:14:08] And I'm going to talk to them about like what scripts they, what are they missing?
[00:14:12] What are, where, where am I failing as a leader?
[00:14:14] Where we're not making these calls and how can I best support them?
[00:14:17] And it might mean me just like getting on the phone and dialing in front of them.
[00:14:19] And I'm listening to how I convert.
[00:14:21] And it's like, you have to be willing to do what other want to be able to be successful in this business right now.
[00:14:27] Yeah, and a lot of agents are probably a little bit mildly depressed.
[00:14:32] Or they're just sitting on the sidelines.
[00:14:33] They're not making those outbound calls.
[00:14:36] They don't want to say.
[00:14:38] Again, we talked about people who are locked into 3%
[00:14:40] mortgages.
[00:14:41] They're like, well, I guess it just is what it is.
[00:14:43] I don't know.
[00:14:44] I mean, I might be talking to homeowners going,
[00:14:46] this is a really good time to consider selling.
[00:14:49] Because it's not great to go to a 6% plus mortgage.
[00:14:52] I understand that sucks.
[00:14:53] It doesn't feel good.
[00:14:54] However, things are probably in a little bit of a discount right now.
[00:14:57] Also, not as many buyers in the market.
[00:14:59] And you know, putting your home on the market is probably a good idea
[00:15:02] because it will get sold pretty quickly.
[00:15:04] So, would you rather sell when there's,
[00:15:07] would you rather buy when there's fewer buyers out there?
[00:15:10] I don't know.
[00:15:11] It seems like a decent time.
[00:15:12] Yeah, for sure.
[00:15:14] And I think like the biggest thing is like realizing that
[00:15:18] everybody with it being kind of a stressful market,
[00:15:21] you with social media, the real opportunity
[00:15:23] is that you can educate people, but you also can entertain them.
[00:15:27] And I think that's why my social media has grown, how it has.
[00:15:30] And that's all the agents I coach.
[00:15:32] I'm like, let's build your business around you,
[00:15:35] around who you authentically are, what makes you happy,
[00:15:37] what makes you tick, what you do on the weekends.
[00:15:40] And then creating really, really, highly shareable content
[00:15:44] that people want to share with their audience.
[00:15:47] And it makes you a local expert, such as like the top five cozy coffee shops
[00:15:52] in Sacramento, right?
[00:15:54] 
[00:15:54] Like the four dog parks, the three secret hikes,
[00:15:56] you know, need to know about.
[00:15:57] Like the five date night spots with a view.
[00:16:00] And what I found is when you create really shareable content,
[00:16:04] not only does the community share your content,
[00:16:07] and then they start like, who is this chick who's always providing such good stuff,
[00:16:10] follow, oh, she's a REALTOR.
[00:16:13] And then whether you need them, they need you now,
[00:16:15] or they know someone who does, they start to follow in your world.
[00:16:18] And then they learn your other pillars of content,
[00:16:20] which that's what I talk about is like,
[00:16:23] when you're building a business through social media,
[00:16:25] you need to have five pillars of content,
[00:16:27] five different things that you're going to talk about.
[00:16:29] Like I coach agents all the time and I go on their page,
[00:16:32] and I just see like canned graphic that says sold,
[00:16:34] pending, open house, like interest rates.
[00:16:37] No one gives a crap.
[00:16:39] Like that is not going to build your business,
[00:16:41] and you're paying some freaking marketing company,
[00:16:43] X amount of dollars to build your business.
[00:16:45] What I would ask you is like, what is your conversion on that?
[00:16:48] When you make a post, what is your conversion?
[00:16:50] How many likes do you have?
[00:16:51] How many shares do you have?
[00:16:52] What's your interaction?
[00:16:53] Because usually you have like four or five likes,
[00:16:55] no comments, and one of them is always your mom.
[00:16:58] Like, you know, and so,
[00:16:59] like one of the first things I do when I'm coaching with an agent,
[00:17:02] is I audit their content.
[00:17:03] And I'm like, let's see what's working well.
[00:17:05] Let's see what tweaks we can make.
[00:17:06] And then let's talk about your pillars of content,
[00:17:09] the five things that really identify who you are as a person.
[00:17:12] Because did you like, if you go on my content,
[00:17:14] you're going to see me being a wife and a mama.
[00:17:16] You're going to see me talk about being a REALTOR and entrepreneur.
[00:17:19] You'll see me talk about multiple streams of income,
[00:17:20] because I believe in that.
[00:17:22] You'll see me talk about postpartum health and fitness, right?
[00:17:24] Like, you're going to see the things that make me tick as a person.
[00:17:27] And the thing for REALTOR is just like,
[00:17:29] somebody might find you because you're in real estate,
[00:17:31] but they're going to stick around because of who you are
[00:17:33] and how you make them feel.
[00:17:34] So if all you're doing is talking about real estate,
[00:17:37] you're missing the vote.
[00:17:38] And the other thing is like, don't just freaking post like
[00:17:40] your open house or, you know, like interest rates.
[00:17:43] You have to add value to them.
[00:17:45] Tell them the five things they need to look at when they're buying a new home
[00:17:48] that they might be missing.
[00:17:50] And like, the key of social media is really in your hooks.
[00:17:54] What the, the first thing you say, the first thing you post,
[00:17:57] whether it's a real or a post or a carousel post,
[00:18:00] like, you've got two seconds to grab your attention.
[00:18:02] So like, what are you saying that's going to stop the scroll?
[00:18:06] So giving an example of a hook that's worked really well for you,
[00:18:10] just to let our audience know, you know, what you've experimented with.
[00:18:14] Yeah, so I mean, you know, you could say like,
[00:18:18] you know, like a great restaurant to try in Sacramento.
[00:18:24] Right? And that's people, most people put a picture of the,
[00:18:26] you know, piece of stake that they got posted.
[00:18:28] And they're like a great restaurant to try in Sacramento.
[00:18:30] How to good date night here.
[00:18:31] I would say like the top three date nights, you need to know about first in Sacramento,
[00:18:36] they're going to leave you wanting more.
[00:18:38] It's like, it's the top three, the number one, the, you know, the secret this, like,
[00:18:43] in three-year listeners, which we can put this in the show notes.
[00:18:46] But if they go to www.RachelsFreebies.com,
[00:18:51] they at the end, they can grab the, like, 23 hooks to help them go viral.
[00:18:59] And actually, as I'm telling you that, I'm going to send a note to my assistant right now,
[00:19:03] because I'm going to have her update that for you guys.
[00:19:06] Yeah, Rachel'sFreebies.com is where you go for that.
[00:19:11] And I mean, Rachel is awesome.
[00:19:12] She's a torrent of information. Obviously, she has all sorts of ideas.
[00:19:16] But let's unpack a little bit about what she said.
[00:19:19] The most important thing I heard was number one, authenticity.
[00:19:23] So talk about the things you're into.
[00:19:25] Rachel rattled off five different areas of her life that she's into.
[00:19:29] And one of those was postpartum health and fitness.
[00:19:32] Like, that's something that a lot of women certainly after moms, a lot of moms can relate to that.
[00:19:38] And of course, a business stuff as well.
[00:19:41] And being a mom and a wife and all of that.
[00:19:44] So this idea of just posting yourself in the gym, okay, fine.
[00:19:48] That's one thing I guess.
[00:19:49] But again, the other thing I heard versus just authenticity is value.
[00:19:54] Like, what am I providing that actually helps people?
[00:19:57] Why would somebody listen or watch my content?
[00:19:59] What are they getting out of it other than me congratulating myself on a just listed or just sold?
[00:20:04] Yeah, okay, fine.
[00:20:06] I guess it's something.
[00:20:07] Maybe it's better than nothing.
[00:20:08] However, it's really just a way to brag about how cool you are.
[00:20:13] And I think people, you know, like your friends get excited to see that.
[00:20:17] They want to see you succeed.
[00:20:17] Your mom, like you said, other than that,
[00:20:19] nah, nobody really cares.
[00:20:21] And people who have other jobs aren't really posting about their success on Facebook,
[00:20:25] about their jobs very rarely unless there's a public reason to do that.
[00:20:29] You know, so it's funny real estate agents love to sort of brag about how good they're doing.
[00:20:33] And that's fine.
[00:20:33] I'm not here to say not to do that.
[00:20:35] But don't just do that, right?
[00:20:36] Like we want to actually give people a reason to go,
[00:20:39] oh, wow, that was helpful.
[00:20:40] That was worth by time.
[00:20:41] That reel was actually helpful.
[00:20:43] And Rachel said, you can kind of do this around anywhere.
[00:20:46] So she gave this unbelievable suggestion,
[00:20:48] which is so easily like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand.
[00:20:52] And then you don't do it.
[00:20:53] It's the key.
[00:20:54] She starts thinking about people who are moving to the area that she represents.
[00:21:00] What are the kind of things they want to know?
[00:21:02] What do they care about?
[00:21:04] And by the way, things like where are the best schools?
[00:21:07] Where are the best grocery stores?
[00:21:09] Where are the best date nights?
[00:21:10] Who's the best dentist?
[00:21:11] All of these things that people actually want to know
[00:21:14] and are going to find figure out for themselves.
[00:21:16] They're going to search that on YouTube as well as online.
[00:21:19] And we want them to come across your content.
[00:21:22] And so you don't necessarily have to make it super real estate specific.
[00:21:25] In fact, most of it probably won't be if you're giving content around people
[00:21:29] like living their lives and what they need to know about the area.
[00:21:32] And here's the cool part about what Rachel's saying.
[00:21:35] You're going to basically reach out to a local business.
[00:21:39] And you're going to say, hey, I really love your floral shop.
[00:21:44] And I think you're the best in town.
[00:21:46] Can I come over and just do a quick one minute interview with you
[00:21:49] and just show off some of your flowers?
[00:21:53] I just want to show it off to my followers.
[00:21:55] And maybe we can come up with a little coupon or something if you want to.
[00:21:58] But regardless, I just want to promote you because you guys are awesome.
[00:22:01] And I love you.
[00:22:02] The person is going to be like, yes, please come by.
[00:22:05] And then of course, you're going to film it.
[00:22:07] It doesn't have to be super fancy.
[00:22:09] You just do it and be authentic with it.
[00:22:11] Ask them how they started the business.
[00:22:13] Why they're so great, et cetera.
[00:22:15] And then you post it and you tag them.
[00:22:17] And then you say, could you please post this on yours as well?
[00:22:20] Of course, they'll do that.
[00:22:21] So what we're doing is cross pollinating with all these other local
[00:22:25] businesses.
[00:22:25] We're also answering questions that people care about because you do
[00:22:30] want to know where the best florist is if you're moving into an area.
[00:22:32] You probably are going to use them.
[00:22:34] Right.
[00:22:34] And so again, Rachel's like nodding her head like, yeah, yeah,
[00:22:37] she already knows all this.
[00:22:38] I am of course just repeating because it is so what is she is giving you guys
[00:22:43] is really, really gold.
[00:22:44] And it's fun too.
[00:22:46] Like you can actually make this content fun.
[00:22:48] It doesn't have to be boring.
[00:22:50] It doesn't have to be something that you think just isn't a super exciting
[00:22:55] real.
[00:22:55] Like also, by the way, when people are buying a home for the first time,
[00:22:59] are they super stressed out about it?
[00:23:01] Yes, we know they are.
[00:23:02] So maybe come up with some reasons to help calm them down.
[00:23:05] Here's some things to think about as you're buying your first home.
[00:23:07] Here's some things people freak out about when they're buying a home.
[00:23:10] All sorts of ideas like that.
[00:23:12] So anyway, Rachel, sorry.
[00:23:13] I didn't mean to steal your thunder.
[00:23:13] You are so awesome with all of this.
[00:23:16] I mean, even what you just said, it's like when I look at anything that I create,
[00:23:20] whether it's a coaching course, a product, a real,
[00:23:23] I'm thinking what holds are there in the market?
[00:23:26] What are agents struggling with that I can solve?
[00:23:30] And then when I solve it, then I'm like, how can I then put a hook on it
[00:23:34] to get it in front of them?
[00:23:35] So one of the things that I've been asked for for like forever,
[00:23:40] for like 12 years is people are like, I don't understand.
[00:23:44] How you get so many leads through social media.
[00:23:47] Like how does it work?
[00:23:48] And so I just taught a class.
[00:23:50] It's called systems of a top producer.
[00:23:51] It's totally free.
[00:23:53] If you guys go to my Instagram and type in the word systems on any
[00:23:57] reel that I have, you'll automatically get the link for this class.
[00:24:01] But one of the things I taught is like how you do a lead magnet.
[00:24:04] And what people don't understand through social media is like how to do it.
[00:24:07] So I kind of want to break it down if it's cool with you of like what that process looks like.
[00:24:11] So I just created, so when I'm thinking about referrals on social media, I think buyers,
[00:24:19] sellers, like my local community, and I think agent to agent referrals.
[00:24:23] So a lot of the times like the content I put out there is to help agents, right?
[00:24:27] Now if I'm doing hyper locally and I want to attract my next buyer and my next seller,
[00:24:30] I have to create this highly shareable content.
[00:24:33] So I came up with a list of 12 and they're like the 10 most walkable dog parks.
[00:24:41] It is like one of the ones that I just posted was 10 cozy coffee shops for entrepreneurs
[00:24:47] you need to know about in Sacramento.
[00:24:50] So the way that I do do this is kind of how the flow works.
[00:24:53] The first thing you're going to do is you're going to come up with your topic.
[00:24:56] Okay, so 10 cozy coffee shops in Sacramento for entrepreneurs that you need to know about.
[00:25:01] That's my hook.
[00:25:02] I'm hooking them because they're like, oh, I only have my like two that I go to all the time.
[00:25:06] What are these other 10 that I'm missing out on?
[00:25:09] Then I take B-roll footage, which means I'm recording something without sound.
[00:25:15] So if people were talking it doesn't matter.
[00:25:17] So I'm going to record something without sound.
[00:25:19] And with this one, I had footage in my phone of like really pretty coffee that I had gotten
[00:25:25] at a coffee shop.
[00:25:25] It wasn't even one that I was featuring, but it doesn't matter, right?
[00:25:28] So I have really pretty coffee on the reel, which your reels are 90 seconds or less.
[00:25:33] The ones that I do tend to be closer to 7 to 10 seconds.
[00:25:36] On it, I literally put the words, the 10 cozy coffee shops you need to know about as an entrepreneur.
[00:25:42] And then I paired it with trending audio.
[00:25:46] And so the trending audio is key, absolute key when you're doing reels because what it does is
[00:25:52] you want to get it on the upswing when it doesn't have a ton of uses, but there's like a number to this.
[00:25:57] So you want to get it on the upswing when it's trending.
[00:26:01] And then you pair that with your reel.
[00:26:03] And then in the caption, that's where I educate and I make myself the expert.
[00:26:08] So I'm like, let's go snack coffee and let's do a mama play date and go grab coffee like the
[00:26:14] little's run around. And then I'm like, here are my top three coffee shops that and I say the name
[00:26:19] of the coffee shop, why I like to vibe. My favorite drink.
[00:26:23] You can go on my social and find this post.
[00:26:26] And then I'm like, for a list of my top 10, comment coffee below.
[00:26:31] So I make my reel, which is what grabs their attention.
[00:26:34] Then I need to get their information, right?
[00:26:36] I want to get their information to be able to call them and have them be my next client.
[00:26:40] So what I do is I will then have my, it's called an opt-in.
[00:26:49] Okay. Now I use something called stand store.
[00:26:52] If you don't know what stand store is, you are missing the boat as a REALTOR.
[00:26:56] Send me a message and type in the word stand store and I will send you a link on how to sign up
[00:27:00] for it and what it should look like. And I'll also send you my really high converting templates.
[00:27:05] So stand store is something that every REALTOR should have. Why?
[00:27:09] Because part of the reason that like link tree or campsite bio or sending them to your website
[00:27:13] doesn't work is as I click here, then click here, then do this. They're gone. You lost them.
[00:27:18] With stand store, I can have an opt-in where literally they click on it and they put their
[00:27:23] information in right there. I wish I could share screen. I would show it to you.
[00:27:27] And then you literally click on it. You put in your information right there and you get an automatic
[00:27:31] download. And what is what you have what you're also doing with stand stores, you're getting the
[00:27:36] automation. So a lot of times like so when I host a class, I'm like comment algo and you know
[00:27:40] the like a lot of REALTOR are using it in 10 seconds. You get the link sent directly to your inbox.
[00:27:46] That's called automation. That's AI automation and stand store has it built in.
[00:27:50] So it can host your content for you. It also is like a beautiful landing page.
[00:27:57] I got two listing referrals this week from my stand store alone and it's so worth it.
[00:28:02] I used to be using an automation tool called many chat, which is 45 a month.
[00:28:06] Stand store is 29 a month and I get to I have my template that's totally customizable.
[00:28:13] Like it's super cool. So I make my real, grab the people. I say comment coffee. They comment coffee.
[00:28:20] I think it to grab their information. Immediately I send them my download, my digital download.
[00:28:26] It's like 13 pages long. The first page is a cover sheet. The second page is like introducing
[00:28:31] them to Sacramento. So excited you're here. Let's dig into these coffee shops. They're the best.
[00:28:36] The next 10 few pages are my 10 favorite coffee shops. And again, I keep the same format where it's
[00:28:42] like a really good picture. And then I have the name of the coffee shop, the vibe of the coffee shop,
[00:28:47] my favorite dream. And then the last page I sell myself is a REALTOR.
[00:28:52] So the whole idea behind it, but everything I've ever done, it's like value value value,
[00:28:56] sign the contract, value value value, follow me value value value. Here you go, right? Yeah, sign up for
[00:29:02] my download. Yep. And so they get the download. They get the value. And then what happens is their
[00:29:08] information, boom, is apps over to my CRM. I then get to call them as a lead. People have been asking
[00:29:15] me for up to create the system and show them how it works for like literally years. So I do have
[00:29:20] 12 lead magnets, like the top trending lead magnets for real estate in every city available.
[00:29:28] So I'll give you the link for that DJ before we're done. But like it, it's changing the game.
[00:29:33] Because all everyone's like, like if you follow these people on social media, they're like,
[00:29:36] I spend no money for my leads. And I built my whole business through social media. And it's like,
[00:29:41] how are you doing that? They're doing it through lead magnets. They're offering really incredible
[00:29:45] value. People want the value. They give their information to get the value. And then by the way,
[00:29:50] you happen to be a REALTOR curious about when you create the content for templates. I have found
[00:29:56] really wonderful, cheap and easy templates on Etsy. It's a great place to search for if you're looking
[00:30:02] for, you know, even if you're just looking for a buyer presentation template, but you can find
[00:30:08] templates there are curious where you find your templates. I create them. I create them myself.
[00:30:14] Even yeah, because this is the thing like, yes, you can get an Etsy template for cheap for sure.
[00:30:18] But they usually don't specialize in social media and knowing the hooks. That's what's going to
[00:30:22] stop the scroll. So like it'll be very generic and other people are going to use it. So if you do
[00:30:27] use Etsy, by all means, but you have to edit the crap out of that thing. Mine are already edited
[00:30:32] for converting because this is what I do for a living, right? Well, like, I think I use Canva for
[00:30:37] everything. So like when you get them from me, you'll get a Canva link and you edit it and you take
[00:30:41] out my information and pop yours in. And then you have the whole system, like the flow of like, okay,
[00:30:47] I've got that I'm going to create my reel that I'm going to have my opt-in page. Then it's going to
[00:30:51] send them to the download. Then it comes to my CRM and now I have a lead. So a lot of agents who
[00:30:56] produce content on social media understand the value piece, right? They're like, okay, I know I need
[00:31:02] to say something that's useful or helpful for people, but they miss the the last piece, which is
[00:31:07] the the soft clothes or the soft mask, right? So now the the the additional step is and I want to
[00:31:14] give you something else. Here's how to get it. Yeah. Yeah. And I think like for me, it always has
[00:31:19] been like add value build the relationship because like even, you know, a lot of people are like,
[00:31:24] Rachel, I have I have all these friends on Facebook. I have all these friends on Instagram and
[00:31:27] followers like, how do I convert that to a client? And I'm I'm similar with how I do it. It's like,
[00:31:33] I want to build a relationship. I want to build rapport and then we transition to business. So like
[00:31:37] DJ, if you are connected with me on social, whether you're liking my content or you're commenting on
[00:31:42] mine, I'm going to look at your page before I respond to you. And I'm going to see what's happened
[00:31:46] in your world and maybe your daughter is graduated from kindergarten or high school, right? Or you
[00:31:50] just got back from a trip to Alaska. Like I'm going to reach out to you, like KDJ, thanks so much for
[00:31:54] connecting with me on an anniversary post with the best time in Tahoe. Oh my gosh, I saw your
[00:31:58] daughter just graduated from from from kindergarten. What a huge milestone for you and your family.
[00:32:02] Do as how many clients coming up for the rest of spring. And I always use whatever hall or whatever
[00:32:06] season we're in because it's easy for me. I'm a systems girl. So like I have a system for it,
[00:32:10] shocking. But like then what happens is DJ's you and I are going to go back and forth and
[00:32:15] end the beginning. We were just like, you commented on something. Usually that's it. But what if you do
[00:32:20] this well? Like a lot of people are like, I want to I want to do social media. So they make a post
[00:32:24] and then they're like, what the heck my business didn't grow? You don't get the business you don't
[00:32:28] ask for. It's not said and forget it. You have to lead generate on social media. So for me when I'm
[00:32:33] generating leads, I do a two hour lead gen block and I'm clicking on likes, I'm responding to comments,
[00:32:38] but I'm building these relationships in the DMs. I'm sending you private messages getting to know
[00:32:42] you and you and I are going to go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And when the
[00:32:46] transition feels good, I'm going to say, gosh, DJ, I feel like we've really aligned so much in our
[00:32:50] personal lives, which makes me think we'd align in our business lives as well. I don't have a great
[00:32:54] referral partner in Chicago. Do you have one in Northern California? Right. And then that's over
[00:32:58] a hundred referrals every single year for us. And this is this is the way we do it. So your first
[00:33:04] going into someone's social media to research and development, basically see what they're up to,
[00:33:10] what are they? What are they into? What's going on in their lives? You're then commenting like
[00:33:14] and engaging with their content, which everybody loves feels good. And then you're also taking a
[00:33:20] next step as in private DMs. And you're saying you're you're commenting on that content again,
[00:33:26] like, hey, just saw you went to cancun, like I'd love to hear about it. That kind of thing. Exactly.
[00:33:32] Yep. You always lead with them and then they're going to ask about you and you go back and forth
[00:33:36] till it feels good. And then you transition to business when it's right. And then you go back to
[00:33:40] personal because you want to build a relationship with this person. I love that. Yeah. Gosh, you make
[00:33:46] it so simple, but it's not simple. Well, it is simple. It's not easy, right? It's simple,
[00:33:51] but it's a lot of hard work because again, it's not just about making videos. It's about making
[00:33:55] videos with a purpose with an intent. You have to do two things. As Rachel said, you have to first
[00:33:59] of all entertain, give people value, give them a reason to want to continue to watch your content.
[00:34:04] And then you have to ask them for something at the end that is even a higher value. So,
[00:34:10] Rachel's going to talk about this idea of having the top 10 coffee places in Sacramento,
[00:34:16] the top 10 baristas or whatever. And then she's going to say, I've got this awesome download
[00:34:20] that'll go ever, ever here, pop up and sign up. And then she's also, then she can obviously follow
[00:34:27] up with those people indefinitely. And I want to talk about open houses. Let's switch just a
[00:34:32] little bit to open houses. How do you do open houses? I still, every single person who joins my
[00:34:40] team, open houses are a non-negotiable part of their business. In fact, when they join,
[00:34:44] we set the expectation that we do two open houses every weekend. And obviously, I want them to
[00:34:50] take a weekend off and have some balance in their world, right? But when I started, I did Friday,
[00:34:55] Saturday, Sunday, Friday was always three to seven. Saturday and Sunday was always 11 to two.
[00:34:59] Those are the times that work for me. I could still get church in. That was what my world looked like.
[00:35:03] So, when I'm doing an open house, I'm going to have a few things to it. I'm going to search the
[00:35:08] open house. I'm going to make sure that the one I'm hosting open matches the price point of my goals.
[00:35:13] Like, in the beginning, I was just like, let me take any open house like I was desperate, right?
[00:35:17] Now that I'm a little further on in my career, I make sure the price point matches my goals. And
[00:35:20] ideally, the location I want to be doing business in, right? And then once I pick the open house,
[00:35:27] I make sure that on social media, I'm really intentionally like building some buzz and excitement.
[00:35:33] And I'll literally post a video and I'm like, hey guys, I'm here at 123 Main Street. Take a look at
[00:35:37] these beautiful mature trees in this neighborhood, show it around. I'm like, okay, so this is a free
[00:35:42] bedroom, two bathroom house, you know, 7 to 240 square feet. It's got a pool. It's one story. You
[00:35:48] guys corner a lot like it does not get better than this. I'm going to show you all around the kitchen.
[00:35:52] So I take them inside. I show them the kitchen. And I'm like, okay, now the one thing you're going to
[00:35:56] freak out about is the primary bedroom, like this closet, you guys is of my freaking dreams.
[00:36:01] Actually, why don't you just come see me from 12 to 3 on Saturday and I'll take you there myself,
[00:36:06] right? And so it's like you hook them, right? You give them a little teaser and you hook them
[00:36:11] that I always do a real for my open house. And then, you know, it's really about building that
[00:36:17] rapport in the open house. And, and, you know, like I always show people in my stories like,
[00:36:22] great guys, we have an open house today, like let's get ready. Here's my outfit of the day.
[00:36:25] You know, grab our coffee, little things, like you think they don't care, but they freaking care.
[00:36:30] And they're totally watching you. And they don't understand what life is like as a REALTOR. So we
[00:36:34] want to show them what it's like in our world doing this for the day. And it really goes over super
[00:36:40] well. And you're also doing it during times where most people aren't working. So they it's even better.
[00:36:45] They have it more of an opportunity to actually observe your content. So I assume you probably go
[00:36:51] live during the open house as well, maybe at the beginning or just like, hey, I'm here, you know,
[00:36:56] I'm curious. What do you do? What's that? Yeah, I'm really good because when you have people that
[00:37:00] are engaging in your content, literally going to ping them and be like, hey, Rachel's live right now.
[00:37:03] And then you're like, oh, what's she doing? Right? And what I found to it's like open houses is the
[00:37:09] quality of the questions you ask. Like I, you know, and going in being like, I'm going to get a good
[00:37:14] lead from this open house. For me, I didn't care. So I would I host my open houses for three hours.
[00:37:19] I don't believe in two hour. I do three hour open houses. And if I got one good lead, the day was
[00:37:26] worth it. That's how my world works. One good lead in the day is worth it, you know, absolutely.
[00:37:33] Difference. So let's say you get one good lead or more, what then? When do you call that person next?
[00:37:41] Do you call them? Do you text them? What's your process? So I don't believe in leaving the open
[00:37:46] house to my lead generation is done. So if somebody got a note, if I met someone at open house,
[00:37:50] I'm literally going to send them a video like with my phone out like what I'm either in my car
[00:37:54] in the house. I'm like, hey, DJ, it was so good to meet you at one to three main street.
[00:37:59] You know, like we chatted about you looking for you know a four bedroom home. I know that,
[00:38:04] you know, this house wasn't the one for you. I want to let you know that when I get home tonight,
[00:38:07] I'm going to be setting up your custom portal. I know you said you still have to get a proof
[00:38:10] for alone. So like I fully get that. I'm also going to shoot you over my lender contact we talked
[00:38:14] about. After you at the portal, I'll send you another text tonight just letting you know you bought
[00:38:19] it. Anyways, hope you have a great rest of your weekend. I'll be in touch. So I do video text messages
[00:38:23] every single time after an open house, every single time because the video they're going to other
[00:38:28] open houses, they're grab and launch. They forgot you. The second they walk out of that house,
[00:38:31] they forgot you. But if you built good rapport them and then you send them a video, they're going
[00:38:35] to remember you. They're going to remember what you look like. And I like to be really intentional
[00:38:39] with writing down something specific. We talked about in their life. So I'm not
[00:38:43] not. And then if I send that to them on a Saturday, I'll be following up on a Monday. If I met
[00:38:49] them on Sunday, I'll follow them up on a Monday. And then I just put them on like my follow-up system.
[00:38:54] And it works really, really well. I do have an 18 minute video on YouTube that walks through my
[00:39:01] entire open house system. And the four questions I asked to convert a buyer at an open house because we
[00:39:07] met a buyer at one of my open houses a listing that I had on a Friday. They were 1.75 million.
[00:39:14] I converted them. And on the next, on that following Saturday, we had them in contract.
[00:39:21] And it was funny because they were selling their house in the Bay Area and then moving to Sacramento.
[00:39:27] And they told their REALTOR like, oh, we found a house, we went to buy it. She's like, oh my gosh,
[00:39:32] I can find you a REALTOR. They're like, no, no, no, we met one at an open house. And they were like,
[00:39:36] no, no, no, like I have somebody better for you though. Like, nope, we found her. We want her. And they
[00:39:41] literally were like, what do we need to sign to work with you? Wow. Because of the quality of the
[00:39:45] conversation I had with them. I don't believe in pressuring people at open houses. I like, when
[00:39:49] they walk in, I'm like, hey, my name is Rachel. Here's the flyer. Let me give you the lay of the land.
[00:39:54] And then I'm like, how do you hear about the open house? You know, like, have you written any offers?
[00:39:57] Are you working with the REALTOR? What's your world look like right now? And then I'm like,
[00:40:01] in the beginning, I'm just like, let me give you a lay of the land. And then I tell them to go tour.
[00:40:04] And then when they come back through the kitchen where I'm usually standing, that's when I hook
[00:40:08] them and ask all the questions. I love that. I love that. Boy, you just said so much. I love the video
[00:40:15] message before you leave for the day in the property or in the house or in the car on the way.
[00:40:22] What percentage of agents who are doing open houses in your area are you doing video messages from
[00:40:30] inside the house or outside the house after the open house is over? What do you think?
[00:40:34] Probably no one except my real estate team because I'm trading. Amazing. Yeah, it's not common practice
[00:40:40] and yet it converts like, we have a 92% acceptance rate for buyers offers. We are a top team in the
[00:40:45] freaking country for a reason. And I think it's because like our systems are follow up, our lead
[00:40:50] generation, our social media, like, you know, like, it's, I never would have considered myself a
[00:40:54] systems girl until I wanted to build a business. But you can't just like wing it if you want to build
[00:40:58] a business. You have to treat your business like a professional because you are a professional
[00:41:02] REALTOR. So you just have to act like it. You know what I've not heard you say anything about today is
[00:41:08] inventories down rates are up. You haven't mentioned that at all because I mean, I'm sure it affects
[00:41:14] you. Obviously it affects all of us. But you're focused on what you can control, which is your lead
[00:41:19] gen. You're just focused on lead gen. Lead gen solves problems. I don't care what's happening in
[00:41:24] the market. My clients care. So I care for them. But I'm also solution based. So what solutions can I
[00:41:29] offer to help make their world better? So well. So it's mindset. That's all mindset. This business is
[00:41:38] hard. Like it, it will chew you up and spit you out. That's why I talked about like who you
[00:41:42] surround yourself with. Like I, if there, I've had people on my team that are like super negative.
[00:41:47] They don't get to stay on my team. Like I, I have to be really intentional with what I allow around
[00:41:52] me because I influence a lot of people. And I'm supporting a lot of people in my coaching world
[00:41:58] and my real estate world. Like my kids, right? Like I don't want to come home with like crappy energy
[00:42:03] because I hung around like crap people all day. Like I want to have good, positive conversations that
[00:42:08] move the needle forward. And like this is a hard business. And you do have to work harder right now
[00:42:13] than you did. You know, during pandemic, when you close your eyes and you'll just float to you, right?
[00:42:18] This is a harder market. And so having these conversations of like what's missing in your business?
[00:42:24] What do you need right now? Like that's the comfort. Literally after we're done here, this is a
[00:42:28] conversation I'm going to have for my real estate team. It's like what's happening in your world?
[00:42:31] What's missing? How can I help you? Because I want to give them the tools. Now we have the tools
[00:42:37] for them. They just have to be willing to plug in. That's the thing that most people aren't willing
[00:42:40] to do is the work. That's like that's it. That's why REALTORS aren't successful or they get out
[00:42:45] of the business because they're not willing to do the work that it takes to be successful.
[00:42:49] But like I didn't want to knock all those doors. I didn't want to do all those open houses. Like,
[00:42:54] you know, what I like about social media is like I can like I told you early before we
[00:43:01] should record it. But like I don't shower every day. Like I have three little kids under five.
[00:43:05] And I'm pregnant. Like it's showering is not a need every day for me. And you know, I on a day
[00:43:11] that I shower, I will bring in three or four outfits. I will record all my videos, you know,
[00:43:16] me sipping coffee, me typing on a computer, me walking through the, you know, towards the phone
[00:43:20] with it on my cell phone. Like, and then I have my content for the week. And then I can post one.
[00:43:25] It's convenient for me. So like I like social media because I can do it around my terms.
[00:43:31] Yeah. Oh boy. That just just makes so much sense. I'm curious about offers because you have
[00:43:38] systems for everything. What is your tip one tip for writing and offer that's going to get
[00:43:45] noticed and hopefully accepted? The number one thing I would say is call the agent.
[00:43:51] Call the agent ahead of time and build a poor and be like, Hey, I'm, my clients really love
[00:43:55] one to the main street. I'm curious what a perfect offer looks like to you. How many offers do you
[00:43:59] have? One you're presenting because your client need a rent back. Who do you have title and
[00:44:03] scroll open with? Like, is there anything else I could do to make our offer stand out? And so
[00:44:08] having that conversation, I never, ever, ever, ever submit an offer without having that conversation.
[00:44:13] And you wouldn't own my team either. You wouldn't be on my team. Like our training is such that
[00:44:18] we're, you're not going to mess up my acceptance rate. Like we're only going to increase it because
[00:44:22] our clients count on it. Like I just closed on a house two days ago. And the agent or the client that
[00:44:29] worked with me, like they bought a house previously and they looked at they had to write six offers.
[00:44:35] And so I prepared them. I said, you know, this is a funky market. Like so we will do our absolute
[00:44:40] best to get your offer accepted and I might take a couple to get the house. And she goes,
[00:44:43] no problem. It took me six last time. I'm prepared for that. But I also like to set the expectation
[00:44:48] and then blow them away. So we wrote one offer. We got our offer accepted and she was like,
[00:44:53] oh my gosh, like this is insane. And it, but it also was like, you know, I don't, I don't ever sit down
[00:44:59] with someone. So this is another thing right now. This is a very second. I'm selling my parents' house,
[00:45:04] my own parents. And do you want to know what I did with my own parents? I sat down and I did
[00:45:08] listing presentation with them. I love it. It's like, why not? So many people, they, like they skip
[00:45:14] the sit, oh, it's my friend. It's my brother. It's my cousin. It's my whatever. And then they do a
[00:45:18] crappy job doing the service because they're like, oh, I can wing it. I know this is what you can
[00:45:23] expect from me. This is what I expect from you. This is how the marketing goes. This is the day
[00:45:27] you're going to go live. These are the updates you're going to receive. My parents receive a
[00:45:30] Tuesday update for me exactly the same with all of my clients because they are my clients. And I
[00:45:35] think people forget that we're professional. They stop acting like we're professional and then
[00:45:40] bad stuff happens. I love it. I think people don't work with their friends and their families because
[00:45:45] they're not treating them like professional and they feel that. So what if you treat your family or
[00:45:50] your friend like your most important client? Because they're the ones who they'd be your biggest
[00:45:53] raving fan. Right. I love that. That is such a, that is such a great tip that nobody has ever shared
[00:46:01] in seven years of doing the show is when you do, when you are lucky enough to have close people
[00:46:06] friends and family who choose you. And let's treat them exactly the same as you would. You're very
[00:46:11] best client that you earned and worked hard to receive. Yeah. Great point. Really great point because
[00:46:17] that will only remember one, it will only deepen the relationship you have with those people.
[00:46:21] Because they're like, wow, she's taking this really seriously. She's not acting as my daughter.
[00:46:25] She's acting as my, my partner here to help me close this. I also wanted to go back just really
[00:46:31] quickly to when you were talking about calling prior to writing, submitting an offer.
[00:46:36] Yeah. Let's flip that around on the listing side. What percentage of the time do you get phone calls
[00:46:42] from agents before they submit offers? That's such a good question. And it's very rare. And it
[00:46:47] blows my mind because I never would do it. I would never submit an offer without talking to the agent.
[00:46:53] And I get offers and like the weirder, the worst ones, the ones that just like forward you a
[00:46:57] docu-sign, are you freaking joking me? Like get out of the industry. Like it's just so weird. So
[00:47:04] it's much less. I will tell you it is much less people calling me when they submit an offer versus
[00:47:09] me calling them. But the ones who do call me, those are the ones I want to work with because I'm
[00:47:13] like they're taking their job seriously. They're doing the steps they need to do to get their offer
[00:47:16] accepted. And the other thing I have to think about is like that's their first impression of what
[00:47:20] is like working with you. So if they're first impression of what it's like working with you is you
[00:47:23] built report, then you called them, then you had your lender call them to say how solid your buyers were.
[00:47:29] Like then they get your offer and all the initials are there. There's no missing dates. Like you're like,
[00:47:33] okay, this is a really good agent. Like this is probably going to be a good experience working with that.
[00:47:39] Boy, you look, I'm blown away because you have given us no all meat, no fat in this episode.
[00:47:49] This is unreal. I feel like I apologize. That's the usual way. That's a wrong metaphor to use.
[00:47:57] But but it is an unbelievable episode. Rachel Adams Lee is there's a reason we bring her back and
[00:48:04] we should keep bringing her back because she's actually, well, we all know she's that good. She just
[00:48:08] earned her. And by the way, this is how she shows up for a podcast. Think about all of the value
[00:48:13] she provided. This is her second time on the show, by the way. So this is how I can tell you,
[00:48:18] I've done 600 plus of these episodes, the vast majority of the time when I interview somebody and
[00:48:24] I'm not putting any blame on my guests, my guests, I'm honored to have them and it's my job to make
[00:48:28] them interesting. This is the easiest interview I've ever done because Rachel's like, here's what you
[00:48:31] need to do everybody. Here's what I do. Here's what's working for my team. And she doesn't hide it behind
[00:48:36] a paywall. She's just kind enough to share it with you because it works. And she also knows most of you
[00:48:41] aren't going to likely do it. Now you should do it and you can do it. And you should, you know,
[00:48:47] let's do it. But Rachel is the most amazing one of our most amazing guests we've ever had. I want
[00:48:53] everybody to do her a favor. Let's follow her on. In fact, you're doing yourself a favor. I want
[00:48:59] you to follow her on Instagram. Rachel Adams. She has almost 50,000 followers there. There's a reason
[00:49:04] for that. She didn't buy them, by the way. These are these are people she's earned. And there's a reason
[00:49:09] she's earned them. And it's the same reason why she's back on the show. And this is back while this
[00:49:13] will probably hit 50,000 downloads. I'm sure on this episode, just because of all the great content
[00:49:18] on here. So do her favor. I also get a maker break your episode, your hook, what you title it.
[00:49:26] That's the thing. So like you also want to make sure what you're titling these are like the whole
[00:49:30] that's missing for them, right? Like, so I don't know what our last one was titled, but message me
[00:49:35] before you post it. And we'll figure out the best hook for this because that's the thing. Like,
[00:49:38] I don't care if you're sending an email. I don't care if you're doing a podcast. I don't care if
[00:49:42] you're doing a real or posting like the quality of your hooks. What is going to get people to choose
[00:49:47] to spend their time on this episode versus something else? Like, that's your maker break.
[00:49:53] Yeah, maybe we do something like the one social media tip real estate eight, the one secret real estate,
[00:50:00] one secret social media video tip that real estate, I'll still that's too long but something about
[00:50:05] we'll take one of these tips and we will we will we will amp it up. But I'm going to ask you because
[00:50:11] you're the expert. So like it's like the one social media tip you need to know about to become a
[00:50:16] millionaire or something like that. It really wants to make a million dollars in this business, right?
[00:50:20] When I interview new agents on like what's your first year goal? They're like six everyone says six
[00:50:24] figures. I want to make 100,000. Like how much of you may be like 40? I'm like, cool. Let's work on it,
[00:50:28] right? But like, everybody wants to make six figures. I don't say yet in a real estate and they're
[00:50:31] doing well. They want to make a million. That's they want to make a million dollars in GCI. Like,
[00:50:35] that's what our goal is. And you know, listening to DJ's podcast and, you know, top-age interviews and
[00:50:42] all of this like, you know, hopefully I provided some value to you guys and we can make it happen.
[00:50:46] Yeah, I want to thank all of our all of our listeners. I want to thank everyone on behalf of our
[00:50:51] listeners. We want to thank Rachel Adamsley for coming on yet again, providing so much insane
[00:50:56] value to our audience. I want to thank our sponsors by the way. They're the reason we can keep
[00:51:00] doing the show. So please check out their services. They we only bring on different sponsors who
[00:51:06] could help you with your real estate practice. And also want to thank our audience on behalf of
[00:51:12] Rachel and myself. Thank you for making it to the end of the episode. The best way that you can help
[00:51:16] us first. I want you to go to Instagram and follow Rachel Adamsley. We'll have a link to that
[00:51:20] in the show notes. Go to Rachel's freebies.com. There's all sorts of contact info there. And
[00:51:25] on Rachel's Instagram, you'll see she has links. She has a link to get you to all of her content as
[00:51:30] well in the description and I enter bio rather. And I also want to tell you how you can thank us.
[00:51:37] The best way you can help us grow. Tell a friend think of one other REALTOR in your office that
[00:51:42] needs to hear this. Oh, by the way, before we wrap up, before I tell it, if you are in the Northern
[00:51:48] California area and you're an agent and you're like, wow, I am not getting this kind of support
[00:51:52] service mentor and coaching from my own brokerage from my team from the people I work with
[00:51:58] probably reach out to Rachel. She's she's she's an unbelievable agent. She has a great team.
[00:52:03] You've heard about all of the way she helps her team reach out to her. She might be a good fit for
[00:52:07] you. So you can obviously find her there. And also if you're an agent in another area and you have
[00:52:13] clients that move in and out of Northern California, well, guess what? Now you have a referral partner.
[00:52:18] Reach out to Rachel and say, hey, let's connect because Rachel also has people that move out of her
[00:52:22] area and they move to other areas and they retire somewhere. Well, if you're one of those feeder
[00:52:27] or guess a feed e spots, whatever the the term is called, if people are retiring to your place,
[00:52:34] you need to reach out to her and make a connection because she's not she's not going to refer
[00:52:37] unless you're really, really good, but she needs to learn about you first. So reach out to her.
[00:52:42] And the main thing we chatted about is if you are wanting to build a business through social and

All right, enjoy the episode. What is the best piece of advice that you've ever received as a real spending? I think the best piece of advice is probably like be aware of who you surround yourself with. Because I think like getting into business in 2012 where there's like short sales and RIOs and it's like a really challenging market. Everybody in my market was like, there's no listings, like the market sucks. And I was like, yeah, there's no listings and market sucks. But it was like, if I wanted to be a top agent and change my life, that mindset wasn't going to get me anywhere. And so I really had to like edit my peer group and be super intentional. And like, I, you know, I just heard that thing like you never want to be the smartest person in the room. And so I was like, okay, like, who can I surround myself with that is doing what I want to do at a super high level. But that also has a priority straight. And so that was a really big thing for me. And it also was like sometimes like my biggest mentors, I'd never even met them. They run a podcast or, you know, they wrote a book, but it's like that can be your mentor if you let it be, you know? Love it. And what's the worst piece of advice you've ever received? Yeah, gosh, there's a lot of really bad advice out there. I think one of the biggest things is like you're like encouraged to buy leads. Like they don't tell you how important it is to like really get your skill set dialed. I know a lot of agents are like, oh, I just want business. And they're like, I'll just take like, I'll get leads. And like, to me, buying leads is like the easy way out. It's like they come to you. But if you don't have your scripts dialed and your objection handlers mastered, like you can't convert that script that lead for crap. And so like I think, I really think like if I'm working with a new agent, I'm like, I want you to think of your business like the legs of a chair. Is this four legs to a chair that hold up the chair that give it a really strong foundation? That needs to be like the legs of your business. And by that, I mean like the legs of your lead generation chair, the way you're going to generate leads. And so I'm like, okay, database 100%. Every single REALTOR has people who like them, who love them, who want to refer business. But then the second third and fourth legs different for everybody. And I think you really do have to try doorknoc. And you have to try open houses. You have to try dialing. You have to try business to business relationships. And you know, all the different types of lead generation to figure out like what really resonates with you. And when you do this well, it doesn't feel like work. You're not like, oh gosh, I have to pick up the phone. And you're like, cool, who do I get to meet today? So I think that's probably my biggest, the worst mistake I made was paying for leads in the very beginning when I didn't have any money. And every month I was reminded of my bad choices because it was just drafting out of my account. And I was like, dang it. Our guest today, welcoming back her back to the show, the amazing Rachel Adams, Lee, I'm going to tell you more about Rachel. She's a coach. She's an top agent. She's, gosh, she does everything. She's on a lot of podcasts as well. And let me tell you more about her. If you missed her the first time, she was so good. She's back. So today, Rachel Adams, Lee from Keller Williams real estate in Northern California, is going to talk about social media strategies, including how to grow your following and beat the algorithm. But let me tell you more about her. She is a small town girl making big moves. She's a top 1000 REALTOR in the US, multi passionate entrepreneur and boy mama of three. By the way, she also runs six and seven figure companies with her husband and lives life on their terms on her terms. She loves helping others tap into their true potential and build the business of their dreams. Fun facts, positivity is her jam. You can find her snuggle on the couch in yoga pants, hair in a messy bun with her laptop. She's only five feet tall. She loves all things social media obsessed with having a healthy marriage. What a great thing to be obsessed about. And things Nutella should be its own food group. My girlfriend would agree. All right. So when everybody to follow Rachel, she has an unbelievable social media following on Instagram at Rachel Adams, Lee will have a link to that in the show notes. Rachel, welcome back again to the show. Thank you. Thanks for having me. I was excited when you guys asked. I am excited always to talk to you because you just have so much to say. And the things you say, our audience really appreciates. So we normally go through and say, how did you get into real estate? But you already did that. And let's just like jump into sort of what our audience really wants to hear is sort of what you're doing now. Because I think this is a tough market. At least here, I'm in Chicago, you're in Northern California. I assume it's similar ish where not as many listings rates are still, of course, where they're at. And agents are a lot of buyers who were locked into a, sorry, a lot of sellers, sorry, a lot of homeowners. Let me rephrase that homeowners who are locked into like a 3% mortgage and don't necessarily want to move. Because who wants to give up a 3% mortgage. So you have just not a whole lot of inventory out there. But the buyers who are out there, not much to choose from and rates are still high. So what are we doing or what are you telling you have? Number one, you run a huge team, an amazing team, and you also coach agents all over the country. So what are you telling people to do right now? So it really is like it's not sexy, but it's like get back to the basics. Because when the market shifts, like I, you know, I've been in it since 2012. Like there was RIOs, there were short sales. Like that's what I started with. So I only knew hard. And so lean generating for me and like it was a volume based business where I had to have X amount of calls. I had not had enough this many doors before I'd get the conversion. And you know, I started my business doing door knocking open houses. I knock 200 doors every week and it three open houses every week. Like every single week. And I was practicing script seven days a week. So like I didn't have any money. I didn't have a client base. Like I was brand new to the business. But what I had was like my drive. And I was super committed to like making things happen. I wanted to change my life, right? I was in a really unhealthy marriage in the beginning of my career. And I just like I wanted a totally different life than what I currently had. And so that means I had to show up differently. And so what that looked like for me was, you know, I so I hustle. I work really hard that first year. I'm knocking 200 doors doing three open houses. And I ain't selling homes for the first four months. So in those four months, I just remember like crying a lot, questioning my life choices, drinking a lot of wine. But then I was like, okay, what do I want to look like? And I kept doing the right thing. And I think that's the biggest thing right now is like you're going to get discouraged. It's going to take more calls, more knocks, more posts, you know, more open houses than you're used to to convert those clients. And when you stay consistent with it and you have really good follow-up systems, that's when the conversion happens because I didn't sell any homes for the first four months. But I sold 39 my first year. That it was 19, that it was 123. And you know, it's only grown the business from there. And I've always wanted to be a wife and a mom. That is like hands down like my dream was always to be a wife and a mom. And so I knew that like when I got to that stage, I wouldn't be able to knock that many doors and do got many open houses with a newborn. Right, like that wouldn't work out. And so I was like, what would this need to look like? And so for me, what it looked like was transitioning to social media. I wanted to lead generation lover that I could turn on when I wanted to work and turn off when I didn't. And you know, that social media has changed the game for me. So what I focus on now is, you know, I have my real estate team. And in fact, when we're done with this call, I am running my team meeting. And today's entire team meeting is about database and follow-up. They're not sexy stuff. The stuff that people are like, I don't want to make those calls or I'm not saying this. But reality is, you know, I did a deep dive into our CRM and realized that we have a lot of opportunities there. And so I'm going to kick my agents butt today. And I'm going to talk to them about like what scripts they, what are they missing? What are, where, where am I failing as a leader? Where we're not making these calls and how can I best support them? And it might mean me just like getting on the phone and dialing in front of them. And I'm listening to how I convert. And it's like, you have to be willing to do what other want to be able to be successful in this business right now. Yeah, and a lot of agents are probably a little bit mildly depressed. Or they're just sitting on the sidelines. They're not making those outbound calls. They don't want to say. Again, we talked about people who are locked into 3% mortgages. They're like, well, I guess it just is what it is. I don't know. I mean, I might be talking to homeowners going, this is a really good time to consider selling. Because it's not great to go to a 6% plus mortgage. I understand that sucks. It doesn't feel good. However, things are probably in a little bit of a discount right now. Also, not as many buyers in the market. And you know, putting your home on the market is probably a good idea because it will get sold pretty quickly. So, would you rather sell when there's, would you rather buy when there's fewer buyers out there? I don't know. It seems like a decent time. Yeah, for sure. And I think like the biggest thing is like realizing that everybody with it being kind of a stressful market, you with social media, the real opportunity is that you can educate people, but you also can entertain them. And I think that's why my social media has grown, how it has. And that's all the agents I coach. I'm like, let's build your business around you, around who you authentically are, what makes you happy, what makes you tick, what you do on the weekends. And then creating really, really, highly shareable content that people want to share with their audience. And it makes you a local expert, such as like the top five cozy coffee shops in Sacramento, right? Like the four dog parks, the three secret hikes, you know, need to know about. Like the five date night spots with a view. And what I found is when you create really shareable content, not only does the community share your content, and then they start like, who is this chick who's always providing such good stuff, follow, oh, she's a REALTOR. And then whether you need them, they need you now, or they know someone who does, they start to follow in your world. And then they learn your other pillars of content, which that's what I talk about is like, when you're building a business through social media, you need to have five pillars of content, five different things that you're going to talk about. Like I coach agents all the time and I go on their page, and I just see like canned graphic that says sold, pending, open house, like interest rates. No one gives a crap. Like that is not going to build your business, and you're paying some freaking marketing company, X amount of dollars to build your business. What I would ask you is like, what is your conversion on that? When you make a post, what is your conversion? How many likes do you have? How many shares do you have? What's your interaction? Because usually you have like four or five likes, no comments, and one of them is always your mom. Like, you know, and so, like one of the first things I do when I'm coaching with an agent, is I audit their content. And I'm like, let's see what's working well. Let's see what tweaks we can make. And then let's talk about your pillars of content, the five things that really identify who you are as a person. Because did you like, if you go on my content, you're going to see me being a wife and a mama. You're going to see me talk about being a REALTOR and entrepreneur. You'll see me talk about multiple streams of income, because I believe in that. You'll see me talk about postpartum health and fitness, right? Like, you're going to see the things that make me tick as a person. And the thing for REALTOR is just like, somebody might find you because you're in real estate, but they're going to stick around because of who you are and how you make them feel. So if all you're doing is talking about real estate, you're missing the vote. And the other thing is like, don't just freaking post like your open house or, you know, like interest rates. You have to add value to them. Tell them the five things they need to look at when they're buying a new home that they might be missing. And like, the key of social media is really in your hooks. What the, the first thing you say, the first thing you post, whether it's a real or a post or a carousel post, like, you've got two seconds to grab your attention. So like, what are you saying that's going to stop the scroll? So giving an example of a hook that's worked really well for you, just to let our audience know, you know, what you've experimented with. Yeah, so I mean, you know, you could say like, you know, like a great restaurant to try in Sacramento. Right? And that's people, most people put a picture of the, you know, piece of stake that they got posted. And they're like a great restaurant to try in Sacramento. How to good date night here. I would say like the top three date nights, you need to know about first in Sacramento, they're going to leave you wanting more. It's like, it's the top three, the number one, the, you know, the secret this, like, in three-year listeners, which we can put this in the show notes. But if they go to www.RachelsFreebies.com, they at the end, they can grab the, like, 23 hooks to help them go viral. And actually, as I'm telling you that, I'm going to send a note to my assistant right now, because I'm going to have her update that for you guys. Yeah, Rachel'sFreebies.com is where you go for that. And I mean, Rachel is awesome. She's a torrent of information. Obviously, she has all sorts of ideas. But let's unpack a little bit about what she said. The most important thing I heard was number one, authenticity. So talk about the things you're into. Rachel rattled off five different areas of her life that she's into. And one of those was postpartum health and fitness. Like, that's something that a lot of women certainly after moms, a lot of moms can relate to that. And of course, a business stuff as well. And being a mom and a wife and all of that. So this idea of just posting yourself in the gym, okay, fine. That's one thing I guess. But again, the other thing I heard versus just authenticity is value. Like, what am I providing that actually helps people? Why would somebody listen or watch my content? What are they getting out of it other than me congratulating myself on a just listed or just sold? Yeah, okay, fine. I guess it's something. Maybe it's better than nothing. However, it's really just a way to brag about how cool you are. And I think people, you know, like your friends get excited to see that. They want to see you succeed. Your mom, like you said, other than that, nah, nobody really cares. And people who have other jobs aren't really posting about their success on Facebook, about their jobs very rarely unless there's a public reason to do that. You know, so it's funny real estate agents love to sort of brag about how good they're doing. And that's fine. I'm not here to say not to do that. But don't just do that, right? Like we want to actually give people a reason to go, oh, wow, that was helpful. That was worth by time. That reel was actually helpful. And Rachel said, you can kind of do this around anywhere. So she gave this unbelievable suggestion, which is so easily like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I understand. And then you don't do it. It's the key. She starts thinking about people who are moving to the area that she represents. What are the kind of things they want to know? What do they care about? And by the way, things like where are the best schools? Where are the best grocery stores? Where are the best date nights? Who's the best dentist? All of these things that people actually want to know and are going to find figure out for themselves. They're going to search that on YouTube as well as online. And we want them to come across your content. And so you don't necessarily have to make it super real estate specific. In fact, most of it probably won't be if you're giving content around people like living their lives and what they need to know about the area. And here's the cool part about what Rachel's saying. You're going to basically reach out to a local business. And you're going to say, hey, I really love your floral shop. And I think you're the best in town. Can I come over and just do a quick one minute interview with you and just show off some of your flowers? I just want to show it off to my followers. And maybe we can come up with a little coupon or something if you want to. But regardless, I just want to promote you because you guys are awesome. And I love you. The person is going to be like, yes, please come by. And then of course, you're going to film it. It doesn't have to be super fancy. You just do it and be authentic with it. Ask them how they started the business. Why they're so great, et cetera. And then you post it and you tag them. And then you say, could you please post this on yours as well? Of course, they'll do that. So what we're doing is cross pollinating with all these other local businesses. We're also answering questions that people care about because you do want to know where the best florist is if you're moving into an area. You probably are going to use them. Right. And so again, Rachel's like nodding her head like, yeah, yeah, she already knows all this. I am of course just repeating because it is so what is she is giving you guys is really, really gold. And it's fun too. Like you can actually make this content fun. It doesn't have to be boring. It doesn't have to be something that you think just isn't a super exciting real. Like also, by the way, when people are buying a home for the first time, are they super stressed out about it? Yes, we know they are. So maybe come up with some reasons to help calm them down. Here's some things to think about as you're buying your first home. Here's some things people freak out about when they're buying a home. All sorts of ideas like that. So anyway, Rachel, sorry. I didn't mean to steal your thunder. You are so awesome with all of this. I mean, even what you just said, it's like when I look at anything that I create, whether it's a coaching course, a product, a real, I'm thinking what holds are there in the market? What are agents struggling with that I can solve? And then when I solve it, then I'm like, how can I then put a hook on it to get it in front of them? So one of the things that I've been asked for for like forever, for like 12 years is people are like, I don't understand. How you get so many leads through social media. Like how does it work? And so I just taught a class. It's called systems of a top producer. It's totally free. If you guys go to my Instagram and type in the word systems on any reel that I have, you'll automatically get the link for this class. But one of the things I taught is like how you do a lead magnet. And what people don't understand through social media is like how to do it. So I kind of want to break it down if it's cool with you of like what that process looks like. So I just created, so when I'm thinking about referrals on social media, I think buyers, sellers, like my local community, and I think agent to agent referrals. So a lot of the times like the content I put out there is to help agents, right? Now if I'm doing hyper locally and I want to attract my next buyer and my next seller, I have to create this highly shareable content. So I came up with a list of 12 and they're like the 10 most walkable dog parks. It is like one of the ones that I just posted was 10 cozy coffee shops for entrepreneurs you need to know about in Sacramento. So the way that I do do this is kind of how the flow works. The first thing you're going to do is you're going to come up with your topic. Okay, so 10 cozy coffee shops in Sacramento for entrepreneurs that you need to know about. That's my hook. I'm hooking them because they're like, oh, I only have my like two that I go to all the time. What are these other 10 that I'm missing out on? Then I take B-roll footage, which means I'm recording something without sound. So if people were talking it doesn't matter. So I'm going to record something without sound. And with this one, I had footage in my phone of like really pretty coffee that I had gotten at a coffee shop. It wasn't even one that I was featuring, but it doesn't matter, right? So I have really pretty coffee on the reel, which your reels are 90 seconds or less. The ones that I do tend to be closer to 7 to 10 seconds. On it, I literally put the words, the 10 cozy coffee shops you need to know about as an entrepreneur. And then I paired it with trending audio. And so the trending audio is key, absolute key when you're doing reels because what it does is you want to get it on the upswing when it doesn't have a ton of uses, but there's like a number to this. So you want to get it on the upswing when it's trending. And then you pair that with your reel. And then in the caption, that's where I educate and I make myself the expert. So I'm like, let's go snack coffee and let's do a mama play date and go grab coffee like the little's run around. And then I'm like, here are my top three coffee shops that and I say the name of the coffee shop, why I like to vibe. My favorite drink. You can go on my social and find this post. And then I'm like, for a list of my top 10, comment coffee below. So I make my reel, which is what grabs their attention. Then I need to get their information, right? I want to get their information to be able to call them and have them be my next client. So what I do is I will then have my, it's called an opt-in. Okay. Now I use something called stand store. If you don't know what stand store is, you are missing the boat as a REALTOR. Send me a message and type in the word stand store and I will send you a link on how to sign up for it and what it should look like. And I'll also send you my really high converting templates. So stand store is something that every REALTOR should have. Why? Because part of the reason that like link tree or campsite bio or sending them to your website doesn't work is as I click here, then click here, then do this. They're gone. You lost them. With stand store, I can have an opt-in where literally they click on it and they put their information in right there. I wish I could share screen. I would show it to you. And then you literally click on it. You put in your information right there and you get an automatic download. And what is what you have what you're also doing with stand stores, you're getting the automation. So a lot of times like so when I host a class, I'm like comment algo and you know the like a lot of REALTOR are using it in 10 seconds. You get the link sent directly to your inbox. That's called automation. That's AI automation and stand store has it built in. So it can host your content for you. It also is like a beautiful landing page. I got two listing referrals this week from my stand store alone and it's so worth it. I used to be using an automation tool called many chat, which is 45 a month. Stand store is 29 a month and I get to I have my template that's totally customizable. Like it's super cool. So I make my real, grab the people. I say comment coffee. They comment coffee. I think it to grab their information. Immediately I send them my download, my digital download. It's like 13 pages long. The first page is a cover sheet. The second page is like introducing them to Sacramento. So excited you're here. Let's dig into these coffee shops. They're the best. The next 10 few pages are my 10 favorite coffee shops. And again, I keep the same format where it's like a really good picture. And then I have the name of the coffee shop, the vibe of the coffee shop, my favorite dream. And then the last page I sell myself is a REALTOR. So the whole idea behind it, but everything I've ever done, it's like value value value, sign the contract, value value value, follow me value value value. Here you go, right? Yeah, sign up for my download. Yep. And so they get the download. They get the value. And then what happens is their information, boom, is apps over to my CRM. I then get to call them as a lead. People have been asking me for up to create the system and show them how it works for like literally years. So I do have 12 lead magnets, like the top trending lead magnets for real estate in every city available. So I'll give you the link for that DJ before we're done. But like it, it's changing the game. Because all everyone's like, like if you follow these people on social media, they're like, I spend no money for my leads. And I built my whole business through social media. And it's like, how are you doing that? They're doing it through lead magnets. They're offering really incredible value. People want the value. They give their information to get the value. And then by the way, you happen to be a REALTOR curious about when you create the content for templates. I have found really wonderful, cheap and easy templates on Etsy. It's a great place to search for if you're looking for, you know, even if you're just looking for a buyer presentation template, but you can find templates there are curious where you find your templates. I create them. I create them myself. Even yeah, because this is the thing like, yes, you can get an Etsy template for cheap for sure. But they usually don't specialize in social media and knowing the hooks. That's what's going to stop the scroll. So like it'll be very generic and other people are going to use it. So if you do use Etsy, by all means, but you have to edit the crap out of that thing. Mine are already edited for converting because this is what I do for a living, right? Well, like, I think I use Canva for everything. So like when you get them from me, you'll get a Canva link and you edit it and you take out my information and pop yours in. And then you have the whole system, like the flow of like, okay, I've got that I'm going to create my reel that I'm going to have my opt-in page. Then it's going to send them to the download. Then it comes to my CRM and now I have a lead. So a lot of agents who produce content on social media understand the value piece, right? They're like, okay, I know I need to say something that's useful or helpful for people, but they miss the the last piece, which is the the soft clothes or the soft mask, right? So now the the the additional step is and I want to give you something else. Here's how to get it. Yeah. Yeah. And I think like for me, it always has been like add value build the relationship because like even, you know, a lot of people are like, Rachel, I have I have all these friends on Facebook. I have all these friends on Instagram and followers like, how do I convert that to a client? And I'm I'm similar with how I do it. It's like, I want to build a relationship. I want to build rapport and then we transition to business. So like DJ, if you are connected with me on social, whether you're liking my content or you're commenting on mine, I'm going to look at your page before I respond to you. And I'm going to see what's happened in your world and maybe your daughter is graduated from kindergarten or high school, right? Or you just got back from a trip to Alaska. Like I'm going to reach out to you, like KDJ, thanks so much for connecting with me on an anniversary post with the best time in Tahoe. Oh my gosh, I saw your daughter just graduated from from from kindergarten. What a huge milestone for you and your family. Do as how many clients coming up for the rest of spring. And I always use whatever hall or whatever season we're in because it's easy for me. I'm a systems girl. So like I have a system for it, shocking. But like then what happens is DJ's you and I are going to go back and forth and end the beginning. We were just like, you commented on something. Usually that's it. But what if you do this well? Like a lot of people are like, I want to I want to do social media. So they make a post and then they're like, what the heck my business didn't grow? You don't get the business you don't ask for. It's not said and forget it. You have to lead generate on social media. So for me when I'm generating leads, I do a two hour lead gen block and I'm clicking on likes, I'm responding to comments, but I'm building these relationships in the DMs. I'm sending you private messages getting to know you and you and I are going to go back and forth, back and forth, back and forth. And when the transition feels good, I'm going to say, gosh, DJ, I feel like we've really aligned so much in our personal lives, which makes me think we'd align in our business lives as well. I don't have a great referral partner in Chicago. Do you have one in Northern California? Right. And then that's over a hundred referrals every single year for us. And this is this is the way we do it. So your first going into someone's social media to research and development, basically see what they're up to, what are they? What are they into? What's going on in their lives? You're then commenting like and engaging with their content, which everybody loves feels good. And then you're also taking a next step as in private DMs. And you're saying you're you're commenting on that content again, like, hey, just saw you went to cancun, like I'd love to hear about it. That kind of thing. Exactly. Yep. You always lead with them and then they're going to ask about you and you go back and forth till it feels good. And then you transition to business when it's right. And then you go back to personal because you want to build a relationship with this person. I love that. Yeah. Gosh, you make it so simple, but it's not simple. Well, it is simple. It's not easy, right? It's simple, but it's a lot of hard work because again, it's not just about making videos. It's about making videos with a purpose with an intent. You have to do two things. As Rachel said, you have to first of all entertain, give people value, give them a reason to want to continue to watch your content. And then you have to ask them for something at the end that is even a higher value. So, Rachel's going to talk about this idea of having the top 10 coffee places in Sacramento, the top 10 baristas or whatever. And then she's going to say, I've got this awesome download that'll go ever, ever here, pop up and sign up. And then she's also, then she can obviously follow up with those people indefinitely. And I want to talk about open houses. Let's switch just a little bit to open houses. How do you do open houses? I still, every single person who joins my team, open houses are a non-negotiable part of their business. In fact, when they join, we set the expectation that we do two open houses every weekend. And obviously, I want them to take a weekend off and have some balance in their world, right? But when I started, I did Friday, Saturday, Sunday, Friday was always three to seven. Saturday and Sunday was always 11 to two. Those are the times that work for me. I could still get church in. That was what my world looked like. So, when I'm doing an open house, I'm going to have a few things to it. I'm going to search the open house. I'm going to make sure that the one I'm hosting open matches the price point of my goals. Like, in the beginning, I was just like, let me take any open house like I was desperate, right? Now that I'm a little further on in my career, I make sure the price point matches my goals. And ideally, the location I want to be doing business in, right? And then once I pick the open house, I make sure that on social media, I'm really intentionally like building some buzz and excitement. And I'll literally post a video and I'm like, hey guys, I'm here at 123 Main Street. Take a look at these beautiful mature trees in this neighborhood, show it around. I'm like, okay, so this is a free bedroom, two bathroom house, you know, 7 to 240 square feet. It's got a pool. It's one story. You guys corner a lot like it does not get better than this. I'm going to show you all around the kitchen. So I take them inside. I show them the kitchen. And I'm like, okay, now the one thing you're going to freak out about is the primary bedroom, like this closet, you guys is of my freaking dreams. Actually, why don't you just come see me from 12 to 3 on Saturday and I'll take you there myself, right? And so it's like you hook them, right? You give them a little teaser and you hook them that I always do a real for my open house. And then, you know, it's really about building that rapport in the open house. And, and, you know, like I always show people in my stories like, great guys, we have an open house today, like let's get ready. Here's my outfit of the day. You know, grab our coffee, little things, like you think they don't care, but they freaking care. And they're totally watching you. And they don't understand what life is like as a REALTOR. So we want to show them what it's like in our world doing this for the day. And it really goes over super well. And you're also doing it during times where most people aren't working. So they it's even better. They have it more of an opportunity to actually observe your content. So I assume you probably go live during the open house as well, maybe at the beginning or just like, hey, I'm here, you know, I'm curious. What do you do? What's that? Yeah, I'm really good because when you have people that are engaging in your content, literally going to ping them and be like, hey, Rachel's live right now. And then you're like, oh, what's she doing? Right? And what I found to it's like open houses is the quality of the questions you ask. Like I, you know, and going in being like, I'm going to get a good lead from this open house. For me, I didn't care. So I would I host my open houses for three hours. I don't believe in two hour. I do three hour open houses. And if I got one good lead, the day was worth it. That's how my world works. One good lead in the day is worth it, you know, absolutely. Difference. So let's say you get one good lead or more, what then? When do you call that person next? Do you call them? Do you text them? What's your process? So I don't believe in leaving the open house to my lead generation is done. So if somebody got a note, if I met someone at open house, I'm literally going to send them a video like with my phone out like what I'm either in my car in the house. I'm like, hey, DJ, it was so good to meet you at one to three main street. You know, like we chatted about you looking for you know a four bedroom home. I know that, you know, this house wasn't the one for you. I want to let you know that when I get home tonight, I'm going to be setting up your custom portal. I know you said you still have to get a proof for alone. So like I fully get that. I'm also going to shoot you over my lender contact we talked about. After you at the portal, I'll send you another text tonight just letting you know you bought it. Anyways, hope you have a great rest of your weekend. I'll be in touch. So I do video text messages every single time after an open house, every single time because the video they're going to other open houses, they're grab and launch. They forgot you. The second they walk out of that house, they forgot you. But if you built good rapport them and then you send them a video, they're going to remember you. They're going to remember what you look like. And I like to be really intentional with writing down something specific. We talked about in their life. So I'm not not. And then if I send that to them on a Saturday, I'll be following up on a Monday. If I met them on Sunday, I'll follow them up on a Monday. And then I just put them on like my follow-up system. And it works really, really well. I do have an 18 minute video on YouTube that walks through my entire open house system. And the four questions I asked to convert a buyer at an open house because we met a buyer at one of my open houses a listing that I had on a Friday. They were 1.75 million. I converted them. And on the next, on that following Saturday, we had them in contract. And it was funny because they were selling their house in the Bay Area and then moving to Sacramento. And they told their REALTOR like, oh, we found a house, we went to buy it. She's like, oh my gosh, I can find you a REALTOR. They're like, no, no, no, we met one at an open house. And they were like, no, no, no, like I have somebody better for you though. Like, nope, we found her. We want her. And they literally were like, what do we need to sign to work with you? Wow. Because of the quality of the conversation I had with them. I don't believe in pressuring people at open houses. I like, when they walk in, I'm like, hey, my name is Rachel. Here's the flyer. Let me give you the lay of the land. And then I'm like, how do you hear about the open house? You know, like, have you written any offers? Are you working with the REALTOR? What's your world look like right now? And then I'm like, in the beginning, I'm just like, let me give you a lay of the land. And then I tell them to go tour. And then when they come back through the kitchen where I'm usually standing, that's when I hook them and ask all the questions. I love that. I love that. Boy, you just said so much. I love the video message before you leave for the day in the property or in the house or in the car on the way. What percentage of agents who are doing open houses in your area are you doing video messages from inside the house or outside the house after the open house is over? What do you think? Probably no one except my real estate team because I'm trading. Amazing. Yeah, it's not common practice and yet it converts like, we have a 92% acceptance rate for buyers offers. We are a top team in the freaking country for a reason. And I think it's because like our systems are follow up, our lead generation, our social media, like, you know, like, it's, I never would have considered myself a systems girl until I wanted to build a business. But you can't just like wing it if you want to build a business. You have to treat your business like a professional because you are a professional REALTOR. So you just have to act like it. You know what I've not heard you say anything about today is inventories down rates are up. You haven't mentioned that at all because I mean, I'm sure it affects you. Obviously it affects all of us. But you're focused on what you can control, which is your lead gen. You're just focused on lead gen. Lead gen solves problems. I don't care what's happening in the market. My clients care. So I care for them. But I'm also solution based. So what solutions can I offer to help make their world better? So well. So it's mindset. That's all mindset. This business is hard. Like it, it will chew you up and spit you out. That's why I talked about like who you surround yourself with. Like I, if there, I've had people on my team that are like super negative. They don't get to stay on my team. Like I, I have to be really intentional with what I allow around me because I influence a lot of people. And I'm supporting a lot of people in my coaching world and my real estate world. Like my kids, right? Like I don't want to come home with like crappy energy because I hung around like crap people all day. Like I want to have good, positive conversations that move the needle forward. And like this is a hard business. And you do have to work harder right now than you did. You know, during pandemic, when you close your eyes and you'll just float to you, right? This is a harder market. And so having these conversations of like what's missing in your business? What do you need right now? Like that's the comfort. Literally after we're done here, this is a conversation I'm going to have for my real estate team. It's like what's happening in your world? What's missing? How can I help you? Because I want to give them the tools. Now we have the tools for them. They just have to be willing to plug in. That's the thing that most people aren't willing to do is the work. That's like that's it. That's why REALTORS aren't successful or they get out of the business because they're not willing to do the work that it takes to be successful. But like I didn't want to knock all those doors. I didn't want to do all those open houses. Like, you know, what I like about social media is like I can like I told you early before we should record it. But like I don't shower every day. Like I have three little kids under five. And I'm pregnant. Like it's showering is not a need every day for me. And you know, I on a day that I shower, I will bring in three or four outfits. I will record all my videos, you know, me sipping coffee, me typing on a computer, me walking through the, you know, towards the phone with it on my cell phone. Like, and then I have my content for the week. And then I can post one. It's convenient for me. So like I like social media because I can do it around my terms. Yeah. Oh boy. That just just makes so much sense. I'm curious about offers because you have systems for everything. What is your tip one tip for writing and offer that's going to get noticed and hopefully accepted? The number one thing I would say is call the agent. Call the agent ahead of time and build a poor and be like, Hey, I'm, my clients really love one to the main street. I'm curious what a perfect offer looks like to you. How many offers do you have? One you're presenting because your client need a rent back. Who do you have title and scroll open with? Like, is there anything else I could do to make our offer stand out? And so having that conversation, I never, ever, ever, ever submit an offer without having that conversation. And you wouldn't own my team either. You wouldn't be on my team. Like our training is such that we're, you're not going to mess up my acceptance rate. Like we're only going to increase it because our clients count on it. Like I just closed on a house two days ago. And the agent or the client that worked with me, like they bought a house previously and they looked at they had to write six offers. And so I prepared them. I said, you know, this is a funky market. Like so we will do our absolute best to get your offer accepted and I might take a couple to get the house. And she goes, no problem. It took me six last time. I'm prepared for that. But I also like to set the expectation and then blow them away. So we wrote one offer. We got our offer accepted and she was like, oh my gosh, like this is insane. And it, but it also was like, you know, I don't, I don't ever sit down with someone. So this is another thing right now. This is a very second. I'm selling my parents' house, my own parents. And do you want to know what I did with my own parents? I sat down and I did listing presentation with them. I love it. It's like, why not? So many people, they, like they skip the sit, oh, it's my friend. It's my brother. It's my cousin. It's my whatever. And then they do a crappy job doing the service because they're like, oh, I can wing it. I know this is what you can expect from me. This is what I expect from you. This is how the marketing goes. This is the day you're going to go live. These are the updates you're going to receive. My parents receive a Tuesday update for me exactly the same with all of my clients because they are my clients. And I think people forget that we're professional. They stop acting like we're professional and then bad stuff happens. I love it. I think people don't work with their friends and their families because they're not treating them like professional and they feel that. So what if you treat your family or your friend like your most important client? Because they're the ones who they'd be your biggest raving fan. Right. I love that. That is such a, that is such a great tip that nobody has ever shared in seven years of doing the show is when you do, when you are lucky enough to have close people friends and family who choose you. And let's treat them exactly the same as you would. You're very best client that you earned and worked hard to receive. Yeah. Great point. Really great point because that will only remember one, it will only deepen the relationship you have with those people. Because they're like, wow, she's taking this really seriously. She's not acting as my daughter. She's acting as my, my partner here to help me close this. I also wanted to go back just really quickly to when you were talking about calling prior to writing, submitting an offer. Yeah. Let's flip that around on the listing side. What percentage of the time do you get phone calls from agents before they submit offers? That's such a good question. And it's very rare. And it blows my mind because I never would do it. I would never submit an offer without talking to the agent. And I get offers and like the weirder, the worst ones, the ones that just like forward you a docu-sign, are you freaking joking me? Like get out of the industry. Like it's just so weird. So it's much less. I will tell you it is much less people calling me when they submit an offer versus me calling them. But the ones who do call me, those are the ones I want to work with because I'm like they're taking their job seriously. They're doing the steps they need to do to get their offer accepted. And the other thing I have to think about is like that's their first impression of what is like working with you. So if they're first impression of what it's like working with you is you built report, then you called them, then you had your lender call them to say how solid your buyers were. Like then they get your offer and all the initials are there. There's no missing dates. Like you're like, okay, this is a really good agent. Like this is probably going to be a good experience working with that. Boy, you look, I'm blown away because you have given us no all meat, no fat in this episode. This is unreal. I feel like I apologize. That's the usual way. That's a wrong metaphor to use. But but it is an unbelievable episode. Rachel Adams Lee is there's a reason we bring her back and we should keep bringing her back because she's actually, well, we all know she's that good. She just earned her. And by the way, this is how she shows up for a podcast. Think about all of the value she provided. This is her second time on the show, by the way. So this is how I can tell you, I've done 600 plus of these episodes, the vast majority of the time when I interview somebody and I'm not putting any blame on my guests, my guests, I'm honored to have them and it's my job to make them interesting. This is the easiest interview I've ever done because Rachel's like, here's what you need to do everybody. Here's what I do. Here's what's working for my team. And she doesn't hide it behind a paywall. She's just kind enough to share it with you because it works. And she also knows most of you aren't going to likely do it. Now you should do it and you can do it. And you should, you know, let's do it. But Rachel is the most amazing one of our most amazing guests we've ever had. I want everybody to do her a favor. Let's follow her on. In fact, you're doing yourself a favor. I want you to follow her on Instagram. Rachel Adams. She has almost 50,000 followers there. There's a reason for that. She didn't buy them, by the way. These are these are people she's earned. And there's a reason she's earned them. And it's the same reason why she's back on the show. And this is back while this will probably hit 50,000 downloads. I'm sure on this episode, just because of all the great content on here. So do her favor. I also get a maker break your episode, your hook, what you title it. That's the thing. So like you also want to make sure what you're titling these are like the whole that's missing for them, right? Like, so I don't know what our last one was titled, but message me before you post it. And we'll figure out the best hook for this because that's the thing. Like, I don't care if you're sending an email. I don't care if you're doing a podcast. I don't care if you're doing a real or posting like the quality of your hooks. What is going to get people to choose to spend their time on this episode versus something else? Like, that's your maker break. Yeah, maybe we do something like the one social media tip real estate eight, the one secret real estate, one secret social media video tip that real estate, I'll still that's too long but something about we'll take one of these tips and we will we will we will amp it up. But I'm going to ask you because you're the expert. So like it's like the one social media tip you need to know about to become a millionaire or something like that. It really wants to make a million dollars in this business, right? When I interview new agents on like what's your first year goal? They're like six everyone says six figures. I want to make 100,000. Like how much of you may be like 40? I'm like, cool. Let's work on it, right? But like, everybody wants to make six figures. I don't say yet in a real estate and they're doing well. They want to make a million. That's they want to make a million dollars in GCI. Like, that's what our goal is. And you know, listening to DJ's podcast and, you know, top-age interviews and all of this like, you know, hopefully I provided some value to you guys and we can make it happen. Yeah, I want to thank all of our all of our listeners. I want to thank everyone on behalf of our listeners.

Tell a friend think of one other REALTOR in your office that needs to hear this. Oh, by the way, before we wrap up, before I tell it, if you are in the Northern California area and you're an agent and you're like, wow, I am not getting this kind of support service mentor and coaching from my own brokerage from my team from the people I work with probably reach out to Rachel. She's she's she's an unbelievable agent. She has a great team. You've heard about all of the way she helps her team reach out to her. She might be a good fit for you. So you can obviously find her there. And also if you're an agent in another area and you have clients that move in and out of Northern California, well, guess what? Now you have a referral partner. Reach out to Rachel and say, hey, let's connect because Rachel also has people that move out of her area and they move to other areas and they retire somewhere. Well, if you're one of those feeder or guess a feed e spots, whatever the the term is called, if people are retiring to your place, you need to reach out to her and make a connection because she's not she's not going to refer unless you're really, really good, but she needs to learn about you first. So reach out to her. And the main thing we chatted about is if you are wanting to build a business through social and you're like, I want to do this, but I just feel stuck. I do something called a 50 content call where it's an hour long call. The first thing we're doing is we're going to we're going to sit down and we're going to audit your content.

I give you the hook, the post, the caption, exactly what you're going to do. Like you're called to action. Everything is done for you and it's customer on you and your business. So like it is a plug-in play system if you want to build a business through social and then at the end we set up your stand store together. So like truly if you guys need help in this space and you want to build through social, like I'm super down to help. Where do they go to sign up for that?
