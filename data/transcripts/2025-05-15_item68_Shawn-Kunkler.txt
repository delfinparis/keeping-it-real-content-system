[00:01:14] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:18] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:21] Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:26] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:29] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:31] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:35] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now.
[00:01:42] And which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:47] Now, I've been recruiting real tours for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents.
[00:01:51] I can tell you with no exaggeration.
[00:01:54] This is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:56] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:04] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer.
[00:02:11] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:19] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:20] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:25] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:02:51] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents.
[00:02:58] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:00] I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:02] And in just a moment, we're going to be speaking with top producer Sean Conkler before we get to Sean.
[00:03:08] And by the way, this episode is amazing because not only is Sean a top producing agent, he is also a student of top producers in the business.
[00:03:17] It's how he learned how to become a great agent and learn from him as he learned from others.
[00:03:23] It's so great.
[00:03:24] I can't wait for you guys to hear it.
[00:03:25] Before we get to that, as a reminder, as always, please, please tell a friend about the show.
[00:03:30] That's how you help us grow and help us continue to do all of these episodes.
[00:03:34] We appreciate it.

[00:03:39] They are so wonderful and help keep this whole machine running.
[00:03:42] All right, guys, let's get to it.
[00:03:44] My conversation with Sean Conkler.
[00:03:59] Today, my guest is Sean Conkler with Compass in San Francisco.
[00:04:03] He is part of Homeward Associates.
[00:04:07] And let me tell you more about Sean.
[00:04:10] So he's an East Coast native who traded Connecticut winners for California, sunny skies in his early 20s.
[00:04:15] And Sean has cultivated a deep love for Northern California and all that his community provides.
[00:04:20] Mastering the art of customer success in his previous career, he pivoted from luxury athletic clubs into the real estate realm in 2017 and is not look back.
[00:04:29] Serving the same discerning bake area clientele, Sean has honed his keynability to anticipate clients, individual needs and identify the right course of action to achieve success driven by a strong desire to help others put down roots in the beloved community.
[00:04:44] He calls home his passion for real estate is possible.
[00:04:47] It is evident in the way he thoughtfully guides clients through the home buying process advocating every step of the way we should mention San Francisco, not barrier rather, not the easiest market to be a REALTOR in as we probably all know.
[00:05:02] So I love talking to agents that are really, you know, doing well out there.
[00:05:06] I just, who scares me to even think about trying something like that.
[00:05:09] He's also an accomplished martial artist and publish author the motor.
[00:05:13] He's also motorcycle enthusiast and he loves riding up the coast visiting museums and hiking Bay area trails on the weekend.
[00:05:19] I want everybody. Oh, and he's a podcast host.
[00:05:21] When everybody to check out his podcast.
[00:05:23] It's very similar to this one in the sense that he talks to top producers.
[00:05:27] And so we couldn't be a bigger supporter REALTOR 180 is the podcast anywhere.

[00:05:44] Sean, welcome.
[00:05:45] Thank you.
[00:05:46] I'm so happy to be here.
[00:05:47] This is going to be fun.
[00:05:49] I am so well, this is light lifting day for me because you are a podcast host.
[00:05:53] So no pressure, but you can you know, the lot of a lot of the interesting stuff is going to come from you
[00:06:01] because you're used to having interesting conversations with agents.
[00:06:04] But I always like to start actually before we get started, I have a question for you.
[00:06:10] And I apologize.
[00:06:11] I usually tell guests about this head of time.
[00:06:12] I didn't this time.
[00:06:13] So I apologize for that.
[00:06:15] But I think you'll be able to handle it, which is what's the best piece of advice you ever received?
[00:06:21] You know, from 2017 on about, you know, being an agent.
[00:06:24] What was the best piece of advice you received?
[00:06:26] Wow.
[00:06:27] That is a great question right out of the gate.
[00:06:30] What's the best piece of advice?
[00:06:34] I want to say, it's funny.
[00:06:38] My brain is going in 20 different directions.
[00:06:43] But I think the best piece of advice that I ever received was wherever you're at in your career.
[00:06:52] Let's say you're one to going into year two or year 10 going into 11 is talk to people who are successful and ask them specifically what they did.
[00:07:12] And so I would say surround yourself with highly successful people and then ask them what they specifically did at that specific threshold.
[00:07:29] That's really, really great advice.
[00:07:32] I always like to say that I'm not going to be able to do that.
[00:07:32] 
[00:07:32] 
[00:07:32] 
[00:07:32] 
[00:07:32] I always love, it's always the fundamentals, right?
[00:07:34] And that is such a great fundamental thing that we should all be doing.
[00:07:38] And also, you know, asking those people slightly above, like, how do you, how do you get from here to there?
[00:07:44] And finding out what those tasks are probably the same tasks, you know, that you do now.
[00:07:50] And what's one bad piece of advice that you've received as an agent?
[00:07:55] I think it's, you know, it's twofold.
[00:07:58] It's I had a really amazing principal when I was in high school.
[00:08:03] And he always said consider the source.
[00:08:07] And so like if you were getting negative feedback from somebody or like someone who's picking on you would be like consider the source.
[00:08:13] And I think when you qualify advice and then you really consider the source, the reality is you only have a couple mentors, but a lot of people, everybody's going to give you advice.
[00:08:24] And figure out what that person's really great at.
[00:08:27] And if they're not, then I probably want to take their advice.
[00:08:32] Yeah, I think that's very wise.
[00:08:34] Wise way, consider the source. That's great.
[00:08:36] Wow, that is fantastic.
[00:08:39] Well, thank you again for being on our show.
[00:08:42] I would love to get to know you a bit better and find out how you got from the East Coast to the West Coast.
[00:08:47] So tell us about previously in, you know, you were in the luxury athletic club business and then, you know, making this the shift how why wear tell me give me this specifics.
[00:08:58] Oh God, that was almost two decades ago.
[00:09:01] So it was quite a while ago.
[00:09:03] I was, yeah, I grew up in the burbs and I grew up in a town that was very, it was a factory town, my dad owned a factory.
[00:09:11] And I grew up working in his machine shop and learning the inner workings of that.
[00:09:20] And I realized that, well, it's a great path.
[00:09:22] It just wasn't for me.
[00:09:24] It wasn't my DNA and I really wanted to, I wanted to do more and different.
[00:09:30] Simultaneously, I was a really insecure and scared kid.
[00:09:34] And so I realized that I need to just get in front of more people to overcome that, that fear that I had.
[00:09:43] And I had an opportunity to do sales and I was about, I want to say 18 years old.
[00:09:49] And I, my, my ex works for a motorcycle seat company and they were hosting a huge event.
[00:09:56] And I went to the event and it was a three day events and it was basically selling seats and installing them.
[00:10:06] And we had a dinner at the close of the event.
[00:10:09] And the president stood up and there was, you know, the senior VPs and the VPs and the regional directors and all these people and he's like,
[00:10:19] I want to basically share what happened in the weekend and blah, blah, blah.
[00:10:22] And he like goes through and he's like, the top two sales people.
[00:10:25] He was the number one, the president and number two was me.
[00:10:31] And I had never done sales before and that's where I got my taste.
[00:10:34] Simultaneously, I, you know, I grew up in a small town and I realized going to New York on weekends and hanging out in Boston that there was just something about a city.
[00:10:45] And wanting to do more, wanting to figure out this different new space.
[00:10:51] I was always enthralled with martial arts.
[00:10:54] I remember as a kid like laying on the couch, I had bad asthma and I, it'd be like the weekend and I'd watch like Kung Fu Marathons and I was just, I loved it.
[00:11:04] I don't know what it was about it, but I loved it.
[00:11:07] And so, you know, as I got a little bit older and started to figure out things, I realized one, I wanted to live in a city and two.
[00:11:13] I really wanted to study martial arts and going to New York and realizing they have the same weather patterns as can.
[00:11:20] And I was like, you know, I really want to go to a different hub somewhere else.
[00:11:27] And I had a pen pal growing up who lived in San Francisco and I learned tidbits about it.
[00:11:34] And I think it was four months later, we moved sight unseen.
[00:11:40] Amazing. And here you are.
[00:11:43] So what I, what I love about what, what you do is obviously you are in, you're doing something I am, I don't do, which is I am not out there in the trenches selling.
[00:11:52] So you are, which I very much admire.
[00:11:56] And on top of that, you also have this great podcast.
[00:12:00] And you're talking to other successful agents.
[00:12:03] So you're giving back to the industry.
[00:12:05] And I think that's unbelievable as well.
[00:12:08] So, you know, tell us a little bit about why do you decide to start the podcast.
[00:12:14] Great question. So I, when I was building my, my real estate team, I had a business coach and we the very first steps were, it was a business coach, not a real estate coach because
[00:12:27] you know, real estate coach is not all of them, but they tend to do a lot of blocking and tackling.
[00:12:32] You need to make more calls, you need to do more of this and you hear the scripts and I didn't want that I wanted business help and advice.
[00:12:40] And so we started down the path of what culture are you looking to build with your team, what's your mission.
[00:12:46] And the mission statement was from JFK, a rising tide lifts all boats.
[00:12:52] And in that, the spirit of that carried over into the podcast of, I really wanted to spend time with top, top, top.
[00:13:02] performers and learn firsthand what they're doing.
[00:13:06] And with that, how can I do that and do what I enjoy, which is learning and talking to really amazing people.
[00:13:14] And simultaneously lift the bar for the industry.
[00:13:18] And it just kind of, it evolved and it evolved out of my curiosity and my passions, if you will.
[00:13:28] Yeah, it's amazing. It's not easy to start a podcast and I've been there and I've continued to be there and I know just how challenging it is.
[00:13:39] And I also know how much fun it is to talk to top producers and find out what they're doing and share their success with others.
[00:13:48] And I know that you've got a hundred hours of interviews under your belt, which is again an amazing accomplishment.
[00:13:56] And I never have counted the number of hours I've done, but I imagine, you know, if I would have thought when I got to 100, whenever that was, that would have been a nice thing to celebrate.
[00:14:06] So I appreciate you acknowledging that I'm sort of the person that never quite knows how many how many episodes he's done or or what what our numbers are at.
[00:14:15] But I do love talking to top producers and it's something that if I were an agent or well, I technically am, but I don't practice if I were practicing it.
[00:14:23] Then I think I would still continue to do this because it is so exciting to hear top agents and you know, just sort of by sheer immersion being around people that are doing these things.
[00:14:34] You know, the the fundamentals get repeated the sort of special techniques get repeated.
[00:14:39] You know, there isn't typically a lot and I'm curious to get your perspective of, hey, I've got this secret sort of strategy that most people don't know occasionally I do hear that and that's fun.
[00:14:50] For the most part, it's I just practice the fundamentals over and over and over again and I work, you know, diligently to make sure that I treat this thing like a business and I structure my day and you know, all of the things that that agents will tell us.
[00:15:02] And yet it seems so hard for so many agents to do that.
[00:15:05] And so I think, you know, just being a producing agent yourself, you know, this is probably just great reminders of every single time you talk to a top producer like, oh yeah, this is what I what I'm doing as well.
[00:15:17] I completely agree. Yeah, it's I think there's a great quote and I want to say it's socrates and it's learning is remembering and you know, more often than not we know we know how to have be healthy.
[00:15:31] We know how to have a healthy business. We know how to do budgets and things like that.
[00:15:36] We just stop doing it. We get distracted in our days and our lives and we we don't do it or we, you know, we just you know, it's, you know, what's one little piece of cake.
[00:15:46] And then you can do that one little piece of cake more and more and and suddenly you're you're at a different different place.
[00:15:53] And so yeah, I think the podcast is the the experience I've had.
[00:15:58] It's twofold. It's the reminder to keep doing this thing and then it's I'm always looking for that one nugget. What's the what's that one thing that I can not change in my business but improve what we're doing by 1%
[00:16:14] and if I can improve it just 1% every day. That's a radical change at the end of the year and of two years at the end of 10 years.
[00:16:23] It's a completely different direction that you're traveling in.
[00:16:27] Yeah, it's that metaphor of what what's not even a metaphor. It's what pilots do right. They think if they're off by even a half a degree, you know, pretty soon it's not even close to where they're where you want to land.
[00:16:37] So there's the self correcting mechanism of always sort of staying on the path, which is doing doing all of those, you know, sort of habits, you know, for for lack of a better term these these habits that we want to cultivate that ultimately continue to reinforce, you know, us pressing down that path and it's hard because
[00:16:55] the most brokerages don't have a structure in place because while you're not an employee at most brokerages. So you are kind of left to your own devices.
[00:17:03] You can't really be told to do a certain number of hours or a certain number of activities other than compliance, you know, and it can be very isolating.
[00:17:13] I think to be a REALTOR it can be it can be tricky. Many agents aren't working in offices these days. So it feels even maybe more singular and individual and it's look, you know, we we are not always able to do everything ourselves.
[00:17:28] And I think this idea of community is so important and I love that you're creating that with your podcast. I've certainly felt that we've built some version of that here.
[00:17:38] And I want to I want to talk about you practicing because moving out to San Francisco again one of the toughest markets. If not maybe the number one or number two toughest markets to not only purchase real estate, but to be real estate agent because of course the price points are so high.
[00:17:52] It's such an attractive occupation. If you can get those land those deals because obviously a lot there's a lot of revenue there. And yet it seems to me to be gosh.
[00:18:04] I don't know how anyone gets business with so many agents and I've talked to a lot of San Francisco agents and you know obviously they figured out.
[00:18:10] So I'd love to hear from you about how you made that transition and how you started growing about growing that your your own business.
[00:18:16] Yeah, it's it's a spicy market. That's for sure. There's to give context San Francisco is only seven by seven miles. Yeah.
[00:18:26] And so the footprint of San Francisco is smaller than Disney's parking lot.
[00:18:31] Mind blowing, right. And within that there's about roughly 6000 practicing agents.
[00:18:38] And so to your point, the competition is fierce and the price points are high. The price points.
[00:18:45] The opening price point is luxury in most other markets for a two bedroom condo.
[00:18:53] And so it's tricky.
[00:18:54] But you know similar to the podcast is I figured out if you if you hang out with the right with successful people virtue of osmosis it rubs off.
[00:19:07] And then simultaneously if you if you hang out where successful buyers and sellers are those conversations are naturally going to come up.
[00:19:19] So I had a teacher in school who always would joke and say you don't go elephant hunting in a bar. Right. You have to you have to go to where the elephants are is really what it what it comes down to.
[00:19:33] And so I very early on I realized I took the city and I kind of you know broke it up and figured out what section of the city do I want to really cut my teeth in and then two fold what brokerage was doing the most transactions in that area.
[00:19:52] And then who were the those top agents doing it.
[00:19:56] And then I hung around those agents I would go to their open houses and just introduce myself and say hi and talk to them.
[00:20:05] And eventually I won the trust of a very prolific agent who didn't have a team.
[00:20:11] And I was given the amazing opportunity to host one of her open houses and it was on the north side of the city it was a 2.5 million dollar property.
[00:20:22] And I would show up 20 minutes early and I would put like six six of my signs out.
[00:20:29] And I would text her when I got there early I would bring a broom and I would sweep the street in front I would clean up the house I would let her know if anything was was off or needed refilling and I would just take care of it and I would let her know that I'm taking care of it.
[00:20:44] And through that she not only gave me a ton of those open houses but then it parlayed into other open houses.
[00:20:52] And from doing that and being consistent and doing that I I feel like I got really lucky but I think luck always meets hard work and I met a guy who had to move he was on a very tight time crunch he had cash in my first transaction in the city was for 2.6.
[00:21:11] Wow and I was like blown away another couple who I met at that property I've got them into contract a couple months later for 1.8 and it my business transformed literally overnight but it it didn't it you know it started with me choosing the right brokerage and then choosing to be around those the right people and then going in not just doing a good job at these open houses but doing such a noteworthy job for me.
[00:21:41] So I was like I was going to go to the office for that agent to make that agent looks so good in front of their client I would send her these reports that were a page long with bullet points of what time I arrived what time I left what the weather was like who were the parties who came through who was their agent I would hyperlink the agents.
[00:22:00] I would put a page and the page is so darn easy for her that she couldn't say no when I said hey do you have any other open house opportunities.
[00:22:09] Eventually she said here's the spreadsheet of all my properties all the dates are in there put your name under anyone you want to host and that's how it's just snowball for me at a really quick clip.
[00:22:23] I wish all of our audience to really go back and listen to Sean
[00:22:30] tell that story over and over and over again because it is the story that I have heard over and over again doing this podcast.
[00:22:38] I cannot tell you you probably have heard it as well.
[00:22:41] Is this beg plead and and earn a top producer, you know, or any producer really say I want to I want to do this, you know,
[00:22:51] I want to do open houses and what what do I need to do to earn that trust, you know, and like you said, make it really easy for them to want you back, you know, and boy, you know, they're getting reports.
[00:23:02] I mean, who sends reports, you know, almost nobody probably, you know, to to the other listing agent.
[00:23:07] And yet, you know, yeah, I'd see boy, what an amazing, what an amazing opportunity for you.
[00:23:14] And and for everyone thinking open houses don't work, they work if you are if you know what you're doing.
[00:23:20] And if you're, you know, anyway, we know they were so wow, what a what a wonderful message for the audience.
[00:23:26] This is so smart. So, you know, I would do that, you know, whatever brokerage you're at, look at the other listings from that brokerage in that area.
[00:23:34] And let's start talking to those top agents or any agent and saying, hey, I want to get better at open houses.
[00:23:40] And here's my plan that I want to do does this meet your standards, Mr. Mrs. Broker, is this what you're looking for in an open house.
[00:23:47] And if not, help me fill in the blanks. And let's let me go do this for you and prove to you that I'm going to make you look amazing to the neighborhood and the sellers.
[00:23:56] And who doesn't want to look amazing to the client, right?
[00:23:59] So exactly what a wonderful suggestion. So thank you for for that again. It's it's so fundamental. And yet it is so easily ignored.
[00:24:08] And it takes courage to ask a top producer to let you show their, you know, several million dollar listing. That is not an easy ask because of course they're like, why would I give that to you?
[00:24:20] Well, eventually you like Sean said he goes, I earned my way into that, you know, probably wasn't the very first time he asked you probably, I imagine you probably had to, you know, demonstrate that you had the competency to do something like that.
[00:24:35] Yeah, I mean, I, you know, it's we've all heard, you know, with clients, you, they have to know you like you then trust you.
[00:24:43] And it's not just similar. It's the same formula for agents. And I remember this agent who didn't know me from, from anybody else, I went to her open house.
[00:24:55] I introduced myself. I saw she was busy. I just said, hi, I wanted to introduce myself. I'm Sean, like, let me know if you ever need anything, have it out left.
[00:25:03] When I was leaving, I saw that her sign on the corner had blown over. And so I stood it back up. I took a photo and I said, hey, you're signed on the corner, blew over. I leaned it up. So it wouldn't fall over again.
[00:25:16] And then that was it. And, and, but I sent it with an image and I remember she thanked me. And so it's, it's those, it's the little things.
[00:25:26] And, and, you know, it's, it's now they, they kind of know you're looking out, right? You're, you're aware and it's, it's, you're getting on the, you get on the radar first.
[00:25:36] And then you just build from there. It's the same.
[00:25:40] I think for agents recruiting for agents wanting to get in front of top performers to do open houses to get in front of clients. It's the same formula.
[00:25:51] Treat everybody like a client. Follow up with them, check in with them, see how they're doing. And don't ask permission to be supportive, just be supportive. And I, I have found from doing that good, good things come from it.
[00:26:07] And just, I think simultaneously, you know, do things without expectation. Just, just do good work. Just do really good workout there.
[00:26:15] Good work usually ends up winning because there is not an abundance of good work in most industries and most professions and even within sometimes most offices.
[00:26:29] So I think this, this idea of elevating 1% you know, making a 1% doable. We can do 1%. I can get better at my listing presentation 1% or my, you know, open house or my customer care calls or whatever.
[00:26:45] You know, we can do we can do 100% that's hard 1% we can do that and then sure enough after after a few months, it's you are at 100% probably even though technically, you know, you're just making these incremental changes, but all of a sudden big, big things start shifting.
[00:27:00] So I want to chat with you because you've talked to so many top agents and I know you have sort of these three items of that you find or strategies or techniques that agents are using really successful ones.
[00:27:14] So I'd love for you to share that with our audience.
[00:27:16] Yeah, it's interesting. It's, it's kind of.
[00:27:20] You know, everything is very Yin and Yang push and pull and the simultaneously if you do the right things you tend to stop doing the wrong things right if you want to start eating healthier and your caloric intake is all healthy food it leaves less room for unhealthy food.
[00:27:38] Right, and if you allocate time to work out you have led less time to sit around on the couch eating ice cream.
[00:27:46] And so a business is not dissimilar. So if you just tend to stop doing the things that don't work and do more of the things that work, you success will come from it. And so the three are are more or less that what you shouldn't be doing, but baked in that is what you should be doing.
[00:28:05] And so I call them the the tourist, the racehorse and the ping pong.
[00:28:11] And I've been I love it.
[00:28:13] And I did it in this way because the way our brains work is we remember stories and they're easier to remember. And so if you just visualize a racehorse and a ping pong and a tourist they will these these things will make sense.
[00:28:28] And so the tourist years and years ago I worked at the Kung Fu school and I was running the schools the federation headquarters and I was under a lot of stress and pressure and I'm trying to run a business and I would have
[00:28:41] instructors call out all the time. And so I'm running a business and I'm teaching 16 classes a week and burning out.
[00:28:48] And I burnt out is really what happened and I I wound up calling a friend and we were talking and he just sold this business and had obviously some good proceeds and he's like, we should just take a trip.
[00:29:02] And I was like, that sounds like a great idea. And so I submitted my resignation and we booked the trip to Italy for a month.
[00:29:12] And we landed in Milan and the best part was we had a flight in and we had a flight out when we had one month and we had zero place to be.
[00:29:22] And so we would literally get up in the morning, look at a map and go, okay, we can go here. And if we're going to flip a coin if it lands on heads will go here and if we flip a tail, so we'll go here.
[00:29:33] And we would literally flip a coin to figure out where to go.
[00:29:37] Fun fact, there's a villa, villa, a concler up near Venice. I didn't get to go see it, but it's on my it's on my to do list.
[00:29:45] And so we had this meandering adventure of just literally flipping a coin of what to do every day. And so the spirit of that and how that relates to business is.
[00:29:58] If you have no plan, that is your plan.
[00:30:01] And in thus the agents who don't have a plan, they tend to just wake up in the morning, flip a coin and whatever it lands on, they tend to do. And so they don't do anything with with a plan.
[00:30:15] And the agents who are succeeding on a very high level, they have a very clear plan.
[00:30:20] They know where they're going and they know the strategies to get them there.
[00:30:26] And so my advice would be to not be the tourist is really what it summarizes down to and have a business plan. And more importantly, I have found from working with agents who I've recruited to the team is have a one page business plan.
[00:30:40] If you can't get it down distilled into one page, you are never ever ever going to execute on it.
[00:30:46] But more importantly, you have to revisit it. You have to sit with it every Monday and look at it and figure out last week, did I do the tasks to move towards this plan.
[00:31:00] And it's not one of these at the end of the years, you said it and then forget it. And then you really look at it next year and you said, oh, we missed or we hit great job.
[00:31:10] That's not how you use it. And so having a really concise plan is what's going to carry you to success.
[00:31:19] So don't be the tourist, but be the almost gosh, you know, I don't know the tip, the opposite of tourists is but but certainly somebody who knows exactly what they're doing when a pilot.
[00:31:33] You know, to go back to your analogy of flying, you know, a plane flying from New York to San Francisco is off course 90% of the time. The pilot's goal is to keep keep it course corrected.
[00:31:46] That's that's their goal. And so within that, there's no failures. The pilot didn't fail because they need to course correct. It was an outcome and they had an outcome they didn't want.
[00:31:57] So they changed it to have the outcome they do want. And so having the mindset of their, their aren't failures. There's outcomes and stop doing the outcomes that are giving you what you know what and start doing more of the ones that are giving you what you do want.
[00:32:12] Yeah, yeah, that makes perfect sense.
[00:32:15] So yeah, I agree. It's talking about attentionality, right? It's the idea of instead of being reactive and it's so easy to be reactive and it can feel so productive to be reactive.
[00:32:28] When things come at us, come into our inbox or text and phone calls and we can just spend all day, you know, batting the balls back and forth that are coming out our way.
[00:32:37] And certainly we have to do that. And we also need to have a time where it's like, no, from this time to this time, I'm doing this other thing. And this other thing is to help me course correct so that I'm not just batting, you know, the customer service, you know, balls all day long.
[00:32:54] You know, I have to be prospecting. I have to be, you know, nurturing my database. And so those are the things that yeah, they're not as easy to get started.
[00:33:03] And also they're sometimes not as much fun. Right. That's the other part is that it isn't necessarily the most pleasurable tasks that are the most profitable.
[00:33:12] Right. And so that's the other thing is we think we also have to really get comfortable with the idea that discomfort is the part probably the pay, you know, the name of the game is how do we stay in distance?
[00:33:24] We're just comfort, healthy discomfort, you know, discomfort that's leading us to where we want to go.
[00:33:28] And that's not easy to step into that because you have to be willing to stand in the way of a bit of misery.
[00:33:35] And misery is the path. And because through misery, you, you know, you get stronger and you get better. And it's and then all of a sudden you're out of the misery.
[00:33:43] And you're you're reaping the rewards, but misery is the place you got to, you got to be willing to step into and it's not a funny lesson to hear.
[00:33:52] And I wish there was another way.
[00:33:55] No, but you know, it relates to working out, right? You go to the gym and then your sore. That's discomfort.
[00:34:03] But you, you earn that discomfort. That's good discomfort because tomorrow when you show up your body's healing, it's growing, it's changing and you're stronger.
[00:34:12] And so that thing that made you discomfort are uncomfortable in the beginning no longer makes you uncomfortable.
[00:34:18] And that's our brains are actually wired like that. The more that you do something that's uncomfortable, that part of your brain actually gets stronger.
[00:34:25] And so the next time you do it, it's not as uncomfortable. That's why, you know, you see these amazing public speakers on stage and their charismatic and charming and engaging with with with everybody or your podcast.
[00:34:39] There's no way your first podcast was as good as the one you, you're your last six.
[00:34:45] I eliminated it for my memory because it was so bad.
[00:34:48] Mine too. I go back and I look at the first one. I was like, oh my god, this was painful, but I got more and more comfortable. And I'm sure now you don't think about who's listening.
[00:34:58] You focus on the conversation and you, you kind of stay in the moment. And but you got there by doing that uncomfortable thing.
[00:35:07] So many times that it doesn't, I'm sure you don't get jitters anymore. You don't get the butterflies. You just, you're like, all right, I know what to do. Let's go. Like this is amazing. This can be fun.
[00:35:18] And it's, it's the same with all the aspects of our business.
[00:35:23] I agree. And I would also add to that to keep me honest that, you know, it's like you're going back to your workout metaphor. So every time I go to the gym, you know, for example, if I have to do a wall sit something that I'm not a fan of doing, I don't like that exercise.
[00:35:39] It's not enjoyable for me. None of the exercises are enjoyable, but that is one of the least enjoyable ones. It hurts. I have to hold it. It's this isometric exercise that I go basically almost until failure.
[00:35:50] So I'm almost like collapsing. And yet that's the path because that's how muscles get torn apart and they rebuild stronger. And then to keep my keep me honest is, yes, the next time maybe, maybe that particular amount of time is easier.
[00:36:04] But that means I have to do more to make it even harder. And I have to keep doing that to ratchet up to keep growing. And so, you know, back to this podcast, yeah, I don't get jitters, but what am I working on to make this even better for us.
[00:36:17] And the truth is that yeah, I could kind of phone it in because I've done it long enough. And I'm sure there's times where I have, if I'm, you know, if I'm being perfectly honest.
[00:36:26] And I don't want to do that. And I want to keep growing. So it's always this consistent, you know, return to discomfort that again, I wish it wasn't that way.
[00:36:35] I wish we just didn't have to, but it seems to be rewarded. It's rewarded by society. It's rewarded by ourselves. It's rewarded just in, you know, by industry. So again, it's, it's never the message I want to hear.
[00:36:49] You know, well said, I mean, and I appreciate the reframe is you're right. Like we, even if you, you have figured out even if you got the wall sit for 15 seconds now at 16.
[00:37:00] Yeah. And then it's 17, then it's 18. And then eventually it's like two minutes, three minutes. And you're like, oh my god, this is crazy.
[00:37:07] You're right. You're absolutely right. You do need, you need that continuous growth. And that's where when we're growing as humans, that's when we're typically the happiest.
[00:37:19] It's 100% those those really challenging experiences in our lives are usually that that moment after was the biggest growth we've had.
[00:37:30] Yeah, I totally agree. And I just thought came to me that I wanted to toss in, which is while I'm doing, for example, the wall sit and it's that, you know, higher level that I did from the previous day doing it or the previous time.
[00:37:47] I have to be, you know, I said this to my trainer a year or two ago, I said, oh, I'm never going to feel strong when I'm working out. She goes, that is correct.
[00:37:55] No matter how strong you actually are, you will never feel strong working out if you work out right away. And so it's kind of that that willingness to be like, oh, I'm not going.
[00:38:05] I'm always going to feel like there's another level to achieve, you know, and that to me is how really successful agents do it. It's not that they're down on themselves or they think they're worthless or they, you know, that I don't think is a good idea. I think shame really shuts us down.
[00:38:20] But if we can say, hey, here's where I'm at. Here's where I want to be. And I, and I'm always going to strive to get just a little bit 1% that 1% better.
[00:38:29] I think is such a good message. I'm so glad you share that because that's something we can, we can jump on. But we have to be willing to go, what's the discomfort that that 1% is going to entail. And I'm going to have to sit with it.
[00:38:40] But I'm going to have pride at the end of that. I'm going to also probably have results. And, and it's going to just, you know, continue to further my growth.
[00:38:51] Okay, tell us about the ping pong. I'd love to hear. So we talked about tourists and being the pilot as opposed to the tourist. Tell us about ping pong.
[00:38:58] The ping pong is, you know, this is a pattern that I've seen with, with agents who kind of started to figure it out. And I've done it myself in my career.
[00:39:08] Is the ping pong is you start doing that thing that really works for you.
[00:39:14] And then you become really successful in doing that one thing. But then you also become very busy.
[00:39:19] So then you recede from doing that one thing. And then the business comes down. And then you're like, shoot, shoot, shoot. I don't have any sales. I don't have a pipeline. So then you go back to doing that one thing or you try something new.
[00:39:31] And then that thing doesn't work. So then you try something else and that doesn't work. And then you go back to the thing that works. And you're like, wow, this really works.
[00:39:38] You do that thing a ton of times. Now you're again busy and successful. And you stop doing that thing. And so your, your business ricochets from having abundance to scarcity and back and forth and back and forth.
[00:39:56] And that really genuinely relates to systems and processes. And no one wants to talk about it because it's not sexy. But they don't have the system in the process of consistently doing that thing to gain new new contacts.
[00:40:15] And then having the system to follow up what's what's the actual workflow after that. And then again, going out and doing that activity again, say the open houses and then collecting those names. I can't even tell you how many agents are amazing. I'll use open houses as an example.
[00:40:34] They're amazing at collecting the names. And then they're like, well, the person didn't respond. So, you know, they're, they're tire kickers or you know, look, you lose or whatever they are.
[00:40:43] And I hate both of those phrases. And it's like, well, how many times did you follow up? Well, I sent them an email. Yeah.
[00:40:50] And you're like, well, how many times once? And so it's like, you need to system on the back end to do it more than once in the reality is marketing statistically, we need to hear about something seven to nine times before we actually engage with it. So the math is the reality is you're going to have to meet a hundred people to have a two percent conversion, meaning two closes a hundred people to have two closes.
[00:41:19] And you're going to have to follow up with a hundred people north of seven times. Yeah. And most people don't have that system in place. And so their business tends to ping pong is sadly what happens.
[00:41:33] And they also don't have the willingness. And again, I'm not this, you know, there before the grace of God, go, I am not, I am not dissimilar from this, but they don't have the willingness to say, I'm not going to see the result on the third call.
[00:41:48] In fact, if I do, it's a fluke, right on the third text, the third phone call the third email, if they somehow are like, let's start working together, I just got real lucky because it's really going to take probably even more than seven to nine touches, you know, might be 30.
[00:42:03] But this idea of I'm going to earn this. I'm going to earn this just like you earned your way into, you know, to some open houses. You have to earn it. And you know, sometimes you get lucky. And those are the ones that probably hurt people the most.
[00:42:17] Because they're so. Exactly. Yeah, they're so fun. The easy win. The easy win. And you're like, oh, this is easy. I only need to do it one time. But you know, to go back to the whole gym is how many times of you are how many people in the world have gone into a gym one time had an amazing workout.
[00:42:36] And they're like, they look into me and like, wow, I'm fit for life. Yeah, never happens. You have to go back, but not only go back, you have to go back consistently over time. And just because you get on the scale, and it's the same number, that doesn't mean that your body's not redoing a re composition, meaning your body fat is going down, but your muscle is going up.
[00:43:00] And so the scale is exactly the same. And so just because you don't see the difference, based on what you're measuring, it doesn't mean you're not getting the results.
[00:43:09] And I think that's, you know, you have that one easy hit. You get that you, you know, you meet that client at the open house and they write the offer on that property.
[00:43:19] And then you get lazy, you don't build the muscle. And so the muscle really is developed through the practice of the follow up. And it's not, it's not a pass fail.
[00:43:31] Just because they didn't respond. That doesn't mean you failed. You're just practicing your follow up. And then within the practice practice different follow ups.
[00:43:39] And never open an email. This is like the Bayne, my existence never open an email with them just following up. I hate that.
[00:43:47] Because you're fishing. Instead, listen to whatever the conversation was and then don't say I'm following up, but follow up with a piece of information that is then valuable to what they're wanting or needing.
[00:44:03] If you met them at a three bedroom and it wasn't a good fit for them. Hey, can you imagine yourself living here? Now, you know what? We really need a second bath. And you were able to collect the email. Well, then your follow up should be.
[00:44:16] Hey, I wanted to check in. I know this property wasn't a good fit because X, Y and Z, but I found this other one that's off market and it is. Did you want to hear more information about it?
[00:44:26] Yeah, that's great. It's it's this. I was thinking about you. Here's something that you might want and letting that be the guiding star versus, you know, I have to check this, you know, this is my fourth email. So I have to just keep it keep bugging you until eventually you break down and go, OK, let's talk.
[00:44:45] And you know, maybe that works. I don't know. I don't suspect it works very well. I think this providing value and going back to, you know, you're talking about ping pong versus systems or versus habits.
[00:44:57] You know, I might even say habits because habits are like, OK, I got the, I got the, you know, the easy win and now I got to go back and make all my dials and I have to go continue to, you know, do my customer service and I have to, you know, it's just consistently running running the same playbook and making adjustments when necessary.
[00:45:13] Of course, but just, you know, I talked to a top producer just last week and she, I said, what do you get just like you're saying, what are you doing right after this?
[00:45:21] So I always love to hear what top producers do during the day. She goes, oh, I have to make like an hour and a half of phone calls and I said, oh, OK, like what kind she goes, oh, they're my prospecting calls. I do it every single day.
[00:45:30] She's been in 20 years in the business. Love it said, I said, really? And she said, I have to she goes, I don't. It's the ping pong effect. You know, I'll be busy for a while and then I won't be.
[00:45:41] She's like, I can't not keep my pipeline full. So and I suspect she doesn't get, you know, a huge hit rate on those phone calls, but she knows that that's the, that's how you earn your way into somebody's into somebody's business.
[00:45:56] You know, again, it goes back to out of 100 people that you know that's in your database, only 2% are going to convert. That's just sales statistics, only 2% and so 98 of those phone calls are they're not, they're not useless.
[00:46:14] They're not useless. They're future business. Because not only that each person knows 3 other people who are thinking about making a move later that year.
[00:46:25] And so that's the gold and and just, you know, it's and I always use this word very carefully. I used it earlier when we said, but we don't make time.
[00:46:38] It's, that's an impossibility, but you can allocate time to do the thing. And in those top performers, they always allocate time and I think they also live by another rule.
[00:46:49] If you have to erase it, you must replace it. You have to put it somewhere else on your calendar. And and that's, you know, the calendar is another ping pong is the top performers that I'm sure you've seen this with your podcast.
[00:47:02] All the top performers use a calendar. They all show up when they have to be there. I can always tell when I'm doing a podcast recording who's now the top performer, just virtue of the emails that I get, hey, are we still on for Friday?
[00:47:18] Hey, I don't see the link here. It's like they're missing all of the cues along the way.
[00:47:23] Yeah, yeah, they don't have systems. And there he is.
[00:47:28] You know, I do, I had this thought and I don't think this is our listeners. So please, I'm not talking to you, the listener, but other people that maybe aren't listening.
[00:47:36] I think there's a lot of REALTORS, maybe the majority of them that don't actually keep a calendar. I don't mean top performers. They all do. But I mean everybody else.
[00:47:44] I suspect I think there's people in my personal life who are who are not REALTORS who don't keep a calendar. I maybe they just have amazing memories. I don't know, but I certainly don't.
[00:47:54] So I, I have to structure every hour of the day pretty much. And that doesn't mean I don't make adjustments. We all do. But I at least try to figure out what am I doing today?
[00:48:04] And what time and I have to write it down because I won't remember.
[00:48:08] Same. I, I cannot rely on my memory at all. And so our listing process, for example, there's a hundred and seven steps. There's a hundred and seven steps because I cannot remember when we have four listings.
[00:48:21] Well, if that one report was ordered for this specific property. So the, when you have systems and processes, those three AM wake up panics don't happen anymore because there's a place for everything and everything's in its place.
[00:48:37] Yeah. And you know, it's a good reminder for me to tighten up some of my systems as well, because that's that is a good.
[00:48:43] If you are having those Sunday scaries or whatever day of the week that is for you.
[00:48:48] It's, you know, I love that phrase.
[00:48:50] Yeah, I didn't come up with it. It's, it's, it's kind of out there in the, in the vernacular now. But I, I said so perfect because I know I know that feeling.
[00:48:58] It's probably because I haven't tightened up my process and I haven't created a repeatable system.
[00:49:04] So yeah, let's talk about racehorse. So we have, we had tourist. We have ping pong. Don't be a ping pong.
[00:49:09] You know, making sure that you're consistent with your, with your disciplined habits.
[00:49:14] And now tell us about racehorse.
[00:49:16] Yeah. So you got to have a plan is the, is the first thing and then you have this, you have to have a system to execute the plan and now the resource.
[00:49:23] The race or if you ever been to a race track, when I turned 30, my friends all decided to take me to the racetrack, which was super fun. We all like put on suits and the women wore sunglasses.
[00:49:34] And it was just like this is just such a cool event. But what's interesting is these race horses, they have a goal.
[00:49:43] Right. So they have the, they're not the tourists. They start at the start line and they, their, their goal is the finish line and not only that to finish first, but the fascinating part is, every horse has blinders on.
[00:49:56] And so now the jockey's goal is to keep the horse doing its job.
[00:50:03] And the blinders are now to keep the horse from getting distracted because if the horse doesn't have them.
[00:50:09] And they focused on the horse that left the horse on the right is going to pass. And if they're focused on the horse on the right, the horse on the left is going to pass.
[00:50:15] So they have blinders to keep from getting distracted.
[00:50:18] And so then they can only focus on that one goal. And I, I feel that because we have the autonomy to do whatever we want with our day, we don't put blinders on ourselves.
[00:50:32] We don't have the discipline and we tend to just get distracted. We sit in these meetings and we hear, you know, Joan over here is doing X, Y and Z. And you're like, I should be doing that. And then so you introduce more pinkongs.
[00:50:46] Now you don't have one ping pong. Now you got two. And then you're like, well, Mike over here is doing this thing. So now let me bring in another ping pong.
[00:50:55] And so now we've made ourselves really busy. We don't have a system to implement these ping pongs.
[00:51:01] And then we are now chasing more and more ping pongs and getting less and less results.
[00:51:06] And so it really boils down to you is you got to have a plan.
[00:51:13] You got to have the systems, but then you got to stay focused.
[00:51:17] And it's distractions that are really killing the business. And those agents who are succeeding on a high level, they have those blinders on.
[00:51:27] And you know, even going back to the agents leverage social media.
[00:51:33] How many set at timer to focus on lead generation on social media.
[00:51:40] But instead they actually just turn it into a scroll fast. And then the next thing, you know, two hours went by.
[00:51:47] And they're looking at like pictures of puppies.
[00:51:51] And so really having the discipline in your in your day to say, hey, I'm doing this thing right now. And I'm not going to be distracted by it.
[00:52:02] One of the simple things that we do is with the podcast, great example, is when I launched it, I decided that we're going to have a goal of, of X amount of months.
[00:52:16] And the goal is to get somebody subscribers or downloads. And then so we won't measure anything until that point.
[00:52:24] And within that, I need to have enough budget allocated for that project.
[00:52:30] And then I need to figure out who is going to execute what because I don't have time to add more ping pongs.
[00:52:36] And then I need to get a full list of things.
[00:52:37] My schedule is already full.
[00:52:39] And so now I have to figure out how to get some of these things off my plate.
[00:52:43] And that's the pre planning to a strategy, whatever your marketing strategy is, is having having the plan to it deciding things on the whim.
[00:52:53] Right. Not referring to your business plan is kind of the kiss of death. It's kind of like, you know, being a tourist in the gym.
[00:53:00] And it's like, if you went to the gym and said, I don't feel like doing wall sits today, but you did that over, you know, 20, 30, 40 days, your wall sits are not going to get any better and you're not going to develop that core strength.
[00:53:14] Because you didn't feel like it that day.
[00:53:17] And so again, having the blinders on.
[00:53:21] Or the coach, the mentor in your back pocket to say, hey, you really need to, this was your plan. Now you need to execute on it.
[00:53:30] Yeah. And having accountability. And I think, you know, that's where like you said, coach comes in accountability partner. If you can't do a coach, you just find another agent. Look, we're all struggling.
[00:53:39] We're all struggling in different ways. And so everybody's going to need accountability.
[00:53:43] You know, nobody does it all perfectly and getting somebody to help keep you on on task is, you know, obviously such a great, a great thing. And it's not a failure.
[00:53:54] I want to make sure if you're thinking, boy, I end up doing scrolling or I end up just infinitely scrolling because yeah, that's what it's designed to do. It's designed to make you do that. That's not even your fault.
[00:54:05] But there's a way around it. Right. And that's by having some sort of accountability where maybe you only allow yourself a certain number of minutes, you know, and having other other processes in place.
[00:54:16] But yes, the hard stuff is hard. The hard stuff is hard.
[00:54:20] Well said.
[00:54:21] Yeah. And I again wish it wasn't boy, I'll be my first question. If there is a creator and I get to meet the creator when I when I pass, I'll be like, why do you make all the good stuff so hard?
[00:54:31] But you probably hear, see, we'll probably say, well, yeah, it's what's supposed to be so.
[00:54:38] So it just is. That's kind of just reality. So, you know, look, you know, we also, I think, you know, just have to be really careful about technology, just capturing our attention when it's it's designed to, especially social media, is designed to capture our attention, because that's how it monetizes.
[00:54:55] So of course, it wants you infinitely scrolling like that's the best possible thing you can do for that service. And it's tricky because you probably have to post on social media.
[00:55:06] It's kind of like the person with the eating disorder trying to learn how to, you know, eat in a non disorderly way. That's not easy because you have to eat.
[00:55:13] So I get that the social media thing is really tricky. But if you keep falling into that hole, that's where you need to say, you know, I keep falling into this hole. I just have to see find a solution.
[00:55:23] And whether it's you put a timer on your phone that locks you out or you get somebody to, you know, just check in with, okay, for the next half an hour, I'm going to post, I'm going to connect with my audience. I'm going to write comments on there, you know, instead of consuming.
[00:55:37] I'm going to be proactive and do something, create content, whatever. And in 30 minutes, I'm going to call you. And I'm going to tell you how many of these I did, you know, or whatever, whatever the system is.
[00:55:46] You know, don't feel ashamed. Microphone struggles with, with infinitely scrolling and she's a super successful executive. So it's not, and she's one of the most disciplined people I know and she can't hardly do it.
[00:55:59] So, and that's how it's designed. I mean, it's, yeah, I could be addicted. And I think you make a really great point, DJ is, is to recognize, you know, to just be very honest with yourself.
[00:56:12] And it's hard to say, you know, I do scroll too much and I do have a problem with that, like, at least whatever it is in your business, just acknowledge it.
[00:56:23] And then whatever I commend is find a solution is maybe log out every time you are done or delete the app.
[00:56:34] So you have to re upload the app before, and then you have to log back in to go do the activity, make it a little bit harder. A really subtle trick for those watching this podcast is my phone is black and white.
[00:56:50] Because the colors make it more attractive to our community receptors. So if your phone is black and white, it loses the red numbers that jump up on all the apps.
[00:57:03] It's, it doesn't have the same appeal to our brain. And so the, the satisfying part of it goes away.
[00:57:11] And so there's, there's tons of little tricks you can get a product like, like, like, Lumly, for example, and you go to that platform and you put all of your social posts in there.
[00:57:23] And then you schedule them to go out. So you don't even have to actually physically go to that app.
[00:57:28] And then as a tree, this is where you know, program, the Pavlovian philosophy or strategy comes into play is listen, I'm going to sit down for 30 minutes and make past client calls. I'm just going to say, hey, I was thinking about you wanted to say hi at the end of 30 minutes reward yourself, set a timer for 10 minutes and doom scroll.
[00:57:49] Yeah.
[00:57:51] Create it as you know, pain and pleasure create a reward for doing the thing or, you know, you know, let's go back to working out.
[00:58:01] It was, I use that because it's easy for me because I did it for the bulk of my life.
[00:58:05] But if you're eating very disciplined for seven days a week, months on end, you get really, it gets really challenging. But if you have a cheat day. Yeah, like, sun that just a cheat meal.
[00:58:21] If a cheat day, if you fall off the fall off the, you know, you fall completely out of cheat day and it just really hurts you the next then make it a cheat meal or two cheat meals or whatever.
[00:58:31] Exactly. And but you then give yourself the reward or like, hey, you know, like I've been eating really disciplined all week. My friends birthdays this weekend. I'm going to have French rising beer. That just sounds amazing.
[00:58:42] And now it's a reward for the hard work. And so it's just, it's just creating these, it's stepping back and looking like where what area do I want to improve.
[00:58:52] How can I improve it? And then how do you, how do you change it? Or maybe you don't like making phone calls. Maybe that's not your thing. But maybe you have a really nice hot tub and you have a cell phone.
[00:59:02] So you know what? I'm going to go put on some cool music. I'm going to go hop in the hot tub. I'm going to fire it up. I'm going to, to cheat day. I'm going to pour glass of wine. And you know what? Then I'm going to make my calls. Yeah.
[00:59:14] What a great experience.
[00:59:16] Absolutely.
[00:59:16] What are you doing? I'm, you know what? I was relaxing in my hot tub. And I was just thinking about my past year. And I was thinking about how I helped you sell by that home or sell it. And I just wanted to say, I, and how grateful I am for the opportunity to work with you.
[00:59:31] Yes.
[00:59:31] And it's like you've changed the whole landscape of what that, what that looks like.
[00:59:37] I, you know, I have a home gym. And one of the ways I keep myself engaged is every once in a while. I'll be like, I really, really have to have this new piece of equipment.
[00:59:46] Okay, what's my goal? All right. I'm going to structure some sort of silly little goal for myself. And when I reach that goal, I'm going to get that product. I'm going to get that thing. And now I have like this new funding to play with.
[00:59:57] And so I think not making the word discipline a dirty thing, but make it like this happy engaging thing that has associated rewards with it.
[01:00:07] Yeah, I love that. Make, you know, change the environment of the, of where you're performing the unpleasant act and try to make it as pleasant as possible.
[01:00:18] And it's, you know, it's hard to feel depressed if you throw your shoulders back and you look up at you or even easier. It's hard to, to be depressed. Well, that's pretty easy. But it's hard to be depressed if you're feeling grateful about something.
[01:00:31] And so you know, well, I'm feeling depressed. I'm not grateful. Okay. Well, if you were grateful about something, what might that be? You certainly have something to be grateful about. Okay. That okay. Now come up with another thing. And another thing. And another thing.
[01:00:42] Yeah, it's past it.
[01:00:47] Like, like, hey, I'm grateful because I'm on this side of the, of the dirt.
[01:00:53] Like, let's start there. I'm thankful. I'm grateful that I can take a deep breath.
[01:00:58] And then you just, you build on, I'm thankful that I have a beautiful safe home environment.
[01:01:06] I'm thankful that I have food in my refrigerator. It's just start really simple and then build them there.
[01:01:11] And again, like I think if you add some body movement and some music, it's, it's really easy for us to downward spiral, you know, you should have a deal blowing up.
[01:01:21] You have, you know, clients pulling out, you have like a lot of bad stuff, but you can go back and re, re calibrate yourself. Our brains can't you cannot focus on being depressed and immensely grateful at the same time.
[01:01:35] It can't like the wiring, there's different parts of the brain.
[01:01:38] It's a totally different part of the brain.
[01:01:40] And just go back to what, like I'm grateful for this opportunity. It's a learning opportunity and it's a challenge, but I'm grateful that I'm having this moment right now because I'm going to learn something. What can I learn?
[01:01:50] And then it's, you change your reframing your perspective on that, that event, which sometimes it's really hard.
[01:01:58] Perfectly said, well, REALTOR 180 is the podcast I want everybody to go check out and subscribe. I'll have a link in the show notes also Sean underscore, Conkler K UN K L E R.

Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now. And which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting real tours for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration. This is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now onto the show. Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris.

My conversation with Sean Conkler. Today, my guest is Sean Conkler with Compass in San Francisco. He is part of Homeward Associates. And let me tell you more about Sean. So he's an East Coast native who traded Connecticut winners for California, sunny skies in his early 20s. And Sean has cultivated a deep love for Northern California and all that his community provides. Mastering the art of customer success in his previous career, he pivoted from luxury athletic clubs into the real estate realm in 2017 and is not look back. Serving the same discerning bake area clientele, Sean has honed his keynability to anticipate clients, individual needs and identify the right course of action to achieve success driven by a strong desire to help others put down roots in the beloved community. He calls home his passion for real estate is possible. It is evident in the way he thoughtfully guides clients through the home buying process advocating every step of the way we should mention San Francisco, not barrier rather, not the easiest market to be a REALTOR in as we probably all know. So I love talking to agents that are really, you know, doing well out there. I just, who scares me to even think about trying something like that. He's also an accomplished martial artist and publish author the motor. He's also motorcycle enthusiast and he loves riding up the coast visiting museums and hiking Bay area trails on the weekend. I want everybody. Oh, and he's a podcast host. When everybody to check out his podcast. It's very similar to this one in the sense that he talks to top producers. And so we couldn't be a bigger supporter REALTOR 180 is the podcast anywhere. Podcasts are served. You can also subscribe to the YouTube channel. Just do a search for REALTOR 180. You'll find them and follow him on Instagram. Sean underscore concler K1K LER will have links to all this in the show note. Sean, welcome. Thank you. I'm so happy to be here. This is going to be fun. I am so well, this is light lifting day for me because you are a podcast host. So no pressure, but you can you know, the lot of a lot of the interesting stuff is going to come from you because you're used to having interesting conversations with agents. But I always like to start actually before we get started, I have a question for you. And I apologize. I usually tell guests about this head of time. I didn't this time. So I apologize for that. But I think you'll be able to handle it, which is what's the best piece of advice you ever received? You know, from 2017 on about, you know, being an agent. What was the best piece of advice you received? Wow. That is a great question right out of the gate. What's the best piece of advice? I want to say, it's funny. My brain is going in 20 different directions. But I think the best piece of advice that I ever received was wherever you're at in your career. Let's say you're one to going into year two or year 10 going into 11 is talk to people who are successful and ask them specifically what they did. And so I would say surround yourself with highly successful people and then ask them what they specifically did at that specific threshold. That's really, really great advice. I always like to say that I'm not going to be able to do that. I always love, it's always the fundamentals, right? And that is such a great fundamental thing that we should all be doing. And also, you know, asking those people slightly above, like, how do you, how do you get from here to there? And finding out what those tasks are probably the same tasks, you know, that you do now. And what's one bad piece of advice that you've received as an agent? I think it's, you know, it's twofold. It's I had a really amazing principal when I was in high school. And he always said consider the source. And so like if you were getting negative feedback from somebody or like someone who's picking on you would be like consider the source. And I think when you qualify advice and then you really consider the source, the reality is you only have a couple mentors, but a lot of people, everybody's going to give you advice. And figure out what that person's really great at. And if they're not, then I probably want to take their advice. Yeah, I think that's very wise. Wise way, consider the source. That's great. Wow, that is fantastic. Well, thank you again for being on our show. I would love to get to know you a bit better and find out how you got from the East Coast to the West Coast. So tell us about previously in, you know, you were in the luxury athletic club business and then, you know, making this the shift how why wear tell me give me this specifics. Oh God, that was almost two decades ago. So it was quite a while ago. I was, yeah, I grew up in the burbs and I grew up in a town that was very, it was a factory town, my dad owned a factory. And I grew up working in his machine shop and learning the inner workings of that. And I realized that, well, it's a great path. It just wasn't for me. It wasn't my DNA and I really wanted to, I wanted to do more and different. Simultaneously, I was a really insecure and scared kid. And so I realized that I need to just get in front of more people to overcome that, that fear that I had. And I had an opportunity to do sales and I was about, I want to say 18 years old. And I, my, my ex works for a motorcycle seat company and they were hosting a huge event. And I went to the event and it was a three day events and it was basically selling seats and installing them. And we had a dinner at the close of the event. And the president stood up and there was, you know, the senior VPs and the VPs and the regional directors and all these people and he's like, I want to basically share what happened in the weekend and blah, blah, blah. And he like goes through and he's like, the top two sales people. He was the number one, the president and number two was me. And I had never done sales before and that's where I got my taste. Simultaneously, I, you know, I grew up in a small town and I realized going to New York on weekends and hanging out in Boston that there was just something about a city. And wanting to do more, wanting to figure out this different new space. I was always enthralled with martial arts. I remember as a kid like laying on the couch, I had bad asthma and I, it'd be like the weekend and I'd watch like Kung Fu Marathons and I was just, I loved it. I don't know what it was about it, but I loved it. And so, you know, as I got a little bit older and started to figure out things, I realized one, I wanted to live in a city and two. I really wanted to study martial arts and going to New York and realizing they have the same weather patterns as can. And I was like, you know, I really want to go to a different hub somewhere else. And I had a pen pal growing up who lived in San Francisco and I learned tidbits about it. And I think it was four months later, we moved sight unseen. Amazing. And here you are. So what I, what I love about what, what you do is obviously you are in, you're doing something I am, I don't do, which is I am not out there in the trenches selling. So you are, which I very much admire. And on top of that, you also have this great podcast. And you're talking to other successful agents. So you're giving back to the industry. And I think that's unbelievable as well. So, you know, tell us a little bit about why do you decide to start the podcast. Great question. So I, when I was building my, my real estate team, I had a business coach and we the very first steps were, it was a business coach, not a real estate coach because you know, real estate coach is not all of them, but they tend to do a lot of blocking and tackling. You need to make more calls, you need to do more of this and you hear the scripts and I didn't want that I wanted business help and advice. And so we started down the path of what culture are you looking to build with your team, what's your mission. And the mission statement was from JFK, a rising tide lifts all boats. And in that, the spirit of that carried over into the podcast of, I really wanted to spend time with top, top, top. performers and learn firsthand what they're doing. And with that, how can I do that and do what I enjoy, which is learning and talking to really amazing people. And simultaneously lift the bar for the industry. And it just kind of, it evolved and it evolved out of my curiosity and my passions, if you will. Yeah, it's amazing. It's not easy to start a podcast and I've been there and I've continued to be there and I know just how challenging it is. And I also know how much fun it is to talk to top producers and find out what they're doing and share their success with others. And I know that you've got a hundred hours of interviews under your belt, which is again an amazing accomplishment. And I never have counted the number of hours I've done, but I imagine, you know, if I would have thought when I got to 100, whenever that was, that would have been a nice thing to celebrate. So I appreciate you acknowledging that I'm sort of the person that never quite knows how many how many episodes he's done or or what what our numbers are at. But I do love talking to top producers and it's something that if I were an agent or well, I technically am, but I don't practice if I were practicing it. Then I think I would still continue to do this because it is so exciting to hear top agents and you know, just sort of by sheer immersion being around people that are doing these things. You know, the the fundamentals get repeated the sort of special techniques get repeated. You know, there isn't typically a lot and I'm curious to get your perspective of, hey, I've got this secret sort of strategy that most people don't know occasionally I do hear that and that's fun. For the most part, it's I just practice the fundamentals over and over and over again and I work, you know, diligently to make sure that I treat this thing like a business and I structure my day and you know, all of the things that that agents will tell us. And yet it seems so hard for so many agents to do that. And so I think, you know, just being a producing agent yourself, you know, this is probably just great reminders of every single time you talk to a top producer like, oh yeah, this is what I what I'm doing as well. I completely agree. Yeah, it's I think there's a great quote and I want to say it's socrates and it's learning is remembering and you know, more often than not we know we know how to have be healthy. We know how to have a healthy business. We know how to do budgets and things like that. We just stop doing it. We get distracted in our days and our lives and we we don't do it or we, you know, we just you know, it's, you know, what's one little piece of cake. And then you can do that one little piece of cake more and more and and suddenly you're you're at a different different place. And so yeah, I think the podcast is the the experience I've had. It's twofold. It's the reminder to keep doing this thing and then it's I'm always looking for that one nugget. What's the what's that one thing that I can not change in my business but improve what we're doing by 1% and if I can improve it just 1% every day. That's a radical change at the end of the year and of two years at the end of 10 years. It's a completely different direction that you're traveling in. Yeah, it's that metaphor of what what's not even a metaphor. It's what pilots do right. They think if they're off by even a half a degree, you know, pretty soon it's not even close to where they're where you want to land. So there's the self correcting mechanism of always sort of staying on the path, which is doing doing all of those, you know, sort of habits, you know, for for lack of a better term these these habits that we want to cultivate that ultimately continue to reinforce, you know, us pressing down that path and it's hard because the most brokerages don't have a structure in place because while you're not an employee at most brokerages. So you are kind of left to your own devices. You can't really be told to do a certain number of hours or a certain number of activities other than compliance, you know, and it can be very isolating. I think to be a REALTOR it can be it can be tricky. Many agents aren't working in offices these days. So it feels even maybe more singular and individual and it's look, you know, we we are not always able to do everything ourselves. And I think this idea of community is so important and I love that you're creating that with your podcast. I've certainly felt that we've built some version of that here. And I want to I want to talk about you practicing because moving out to San Francisco again one of the toughest markets. If not maybe the number one or number two toughest markets to not only purchase real estate, but to be real estate agent because of course the price points are so high. It's such an attractive occupation. If you can get those land those deals because obviously a lot there's a lot of revenue there. And yet it seems to me to be gosh. I don't know how anyone gets business with so many agents and I've talked to a lot of San Francisco agents and you know obviously they figured out. So I'd love to hear from you about how you made that transition and how you started growing about growing that your your own business. Yeah, it's it's a spicy market. That's for sure. There's to give context San Francisco is only seven by seven miles. Yeah. And so the footprint of San Francisco is smaller than Disney's parking lot. Mind blowing, right. And within that there's about roughly 6000 practicing agents. And so to your point, the competition is fierce and the price points are high. The price points. The opening price point is luxury in most other markets for a two bedroom condo. And so it's tricky. But you know similar to the podcast is I figured out if you if you hang out with the right with successful people virtue of osmosis it rubs off. And then simultaneously if you if you hang out where successful buyers and sellers are those conversations are naturally going to come up. So I had a teacher in school who always would joke and say you don't go elephant hunting in a bar. Right. You have to you have to go to where the elephants are is really what it what it comes down to. And so I very early on I realized I took the city and I kind of you know broke it up and figured out what section of the city do I want to really cut my teeth in and then two fold what brokerage was doing the most transactions in that area. And then who were the those top agents doing it. And then I hung around those agents I would go to their open houses and just introduce myself and say hi and talk to them. And eventually I won the trust of a very prolific agent who didn't have a team. And I was given the amazing opportunity to host one of her open houses and it was on the north side of the city it was a 2.5 million dollar property. And I would show up 20 minutes early and I would put like six six of my signs out. And I would text her when I got there early I would bring a broom and I would sweep the street in front I would clean up the house I would let her know if anything was was off or needed refilling and I would just take care of it and I would let her know that I'm taking care of it. And through that she not only gave me a ton of those open houses but then it parlayed into other open houses. And from doing that and being consistent and doing that I I feel like I got really lucky but I think luck always meets hard work and I met a guy who had to move he was on a very tight time crunch he had cash in my first transaction in the city was for 2.6. Wow and I was like blown away another couple who I met at that property I've got them into contract a couple months later for 1.8 and it my business transformed literally overnight but it it didn't it you know it started with me choosing the right brokerage and then choosing to be around those the right people and then going in not just doing a good job at these open houses but doing such a noteworthy job for me. So I was like I was going to go to the office for that agent to make that agent looks so good in front of their client I would send her these reports that were a page long with bullet points of what time I arrived what time I left what the weather was like who were the parties who came through who was their agent I would hyperlink the agents. I would put a page and the page is so darn easy for her that she couldn't say no when I said hey do you have any other open house opportunities. Eventually she said here's the spreadsheet of all my properties all the dates are in there put your name under anyone you want to host and that's how it's just snowball for me at a really quick clip. I wish all of our audience to really go back and listen to Sean tell that story over and over and over again because it is the story that I have heard over and over again doing this podcast. I cannot tell you you probably have heard it as well. Is this beg plead and and earn a top producer, you know, or any producer really say I want to I want to do this, you know, I want to do open houses and what what do I need to do to earn that trust, you know, and like you said, make it really easy for them to want you back, you know, and boy, you know, they're getting reports. I mean, who sends reports, you know, almost nobody probably, you know, to to the other listing agent. And yet, you know, yeah, I'd see boy, what an amazing, what an amazing opportunity for you. And and for everyone thinking open houses don't work, they work if you are if you know what you're doing. And if you're, you know, anyway, we know they were so wow, what a what a wonderful message for the audience. This is so smart. So, you know, I would do that, you know, whatever brokerage you're at, look at the other listings from that brokerage in that area. And let's start talking to those top agents or any agent and saying, hey, I want to get better at open houses. And here's my plan that I want to do does this meet your standards, Mr. Mrs. Broker, is this what you're looking for in an open house. And if not, help me fill in the blanks. And let's let me go do this for you and prove to you that I'm going to make you look amazing to the neighborhood and the sellers. And who doesn't want to look amazing to the client, right? So exactly what a wonderful suggestion. So thank you for for that again. It's it's so fundamental. And yet it is so easily ignored. And it takes courage to ask a top producer to let you show their, you know, several million dollar listing. That is not an easy ask because of course they're like, why would I give that to you? Well, eventually you like Sean said he goes, I earned my way into that, you know, probably wasn't the very first time he asked you probably, I imagine you probably had to, you know, demonstrate that you had the competency to do something like that. Yeah, I mean, I, you know, it's we've all heard, you know, with clients, you, they have to know you like you then trust you. And it's not just similar. It's the same formula for agents. And I remember this agent who didn't know me from, from anybody else, I went to her open house. I introduced myself. I saw she was busy. I just said, hi, I wanted to introduce myself. I'm Sean, like, let me know if you ever need anything, have it out left. When I was leaving, I saw that her sign on the corner had blown over. And so I stood it back up. I took a photo and I said, hey, you're signed on the corner, blew over. I leaned it up. So it wouldn't fall over again. And then that was it. And, and, but I sent it with an image and I remember she thanked me. And so it's, it's those, it's the little things. And, and, you know, it's, it's now they, they kind of know you're looking out, right? You're, you're aware and it's, it's, you're getting on the, you get on the radar first. And then you just build from there. It's the same. I think for agents recruiting for agents wanting to get in front of top performers to do open houses to get in front of clients. It's the same formula. Treat everybody like a client. Follow up with them, check in with them, see how they're doing. And don't ask permission to be supportive, just be supportive. And I, I have found from doing that good, good things come from it. And just, I think simultaneously, you know, do things without expectation. Just, just do good work. Just do really good workout there. Good work usually ends up winning because there is not an abundance of good work in most industries and most professions and even within sometimes most offices. So I think this, this idea of elevating 1% you know, making a 1% doable. We can do 1%. I can get better at my listing presentation 1% or my, you know, open house or my customer care calls or whatever. You know, we can do we can do 100% that's hard 1% we can do that and then sure enough after after a few months, it's you are at 100% probably even though technically, you know, you're just making these incremental changes, but all of a sudden big, big things start shifting. So I want to chat with you because you've talked to so many top agents and I know you have sort of these three items of that you find or strategies or techniques that agents are using really successful ones. So I'd love for you to share that with our audience. Yeah, it's interesting. It's, it's kind of. You know, everything is very Yin and Yang push and pull and the simultaneously if you do the right things you tend to stop doing the wrong things right if you want to start eating healthier and your caloric intake is all healthy food it leaves less room for unhealthy food. Right, and if you allocate time to work out you have led less time to sit around on the couch eating ice cream. And so a business is not dissimilar. So if you just tend to stop doing the things that don't work and do more of the things that work, you success will come from it. And so the three are are more or less that what you shouldn't be doing, but baked in that is what you should be doing. And so I call them the the tourist, the racehorse and the ping pong. And I've been I love it. And I did it in this way because the way our brains work is we remember stories and they're easier to remember. And so if you just visualize a racehorse and a ping pong and a tourist they will these these things will make sense. And so the tourist years and years ago I worked at the Kung Fu school and I was running the schools the federation headquarters and I was under a lot of stress and pressure and I'm trying to run a business and I would have instructors call out all the time. And so I'm running a business and I'm teaching 16 classes a week and burning out. And I burnt out is really what happened and I I wound up calling a friend and we were talking and he just sold this business and had obviously some good proceeds and he's like, we should just take a trip. And I was like, that sounds like a great idea. And so I submitted my resignation and we booked the trip to Italy for a month. And we landed in Milan and the best part was we had a flight in and we had a flight out when we had one month and we had zero place to be. And so we would literally get up in the morning, look at a map and go, okay, we can go here. And if we're going to flip a coin if it lands on heads will go here and if we flip a tail, so we'll go here. And we would literally flip a coin to figure out where to go. Fun fact, there's a villa, villa, a concler up near Venice. I didn't get to go see it, but it's on my it's on my to do list. And so we had this meandering adventure of just literally flipping a coin of what to do every day. And so the spirit of that and how that relates to business is. If you have no plan, that is your plan. And in thus the agents who don't have a plan, they tend to just wake up in the morning, flip a coin and whatever it lands on, they tend to do. And so they don't do anything with with a plan. And the agents who are succeeding on a very high level, they have a very clear plan. They know where they're going and they know the strategies to get them there. And so my advice would be to not be the tourist is really what it summarizes down to and have a business plan. And more importantly, I have found from working with agents who I've recruited to the team is have a one page business plan. If you can't get it down distilled into one page, you are never ever ever going to execute on it. But more importantly, you have to revisit it. You have to sit with it every Monday and look at it and figure out last week, did I do the tasks to move towards this plan. And it's not one of these at the end of the years, you said it and then forget it. And then you really look at it next year and you said, oh, we missed or we hit great job. That's not how you use it. And so having a really concise plan is what's going to carry you to success. So don't be the tourist, but be the almost gosh, you know, I don't know the tip, the opposite of tourists is but but certainly somebody who knows exactly what they're doing when a pilot. You know, to go back to your analogy of flying, you know, a plane flying from New York to San Francisco is off course 90% of the time. The pilot's goal is to keep keep it course corrected. That's that's their goal. And so within that, there's no failures. The pilot didn't fail because they need to course correct. It was an outcome and they had an outcome they didn't want. So they changed it to have the outcome they do want. And so having the mindset of their, their aren't failures. There's outcomes and stop doing the outcomes that are giving you what you know what and start doing more of the ones that are giving you what you do want. Yeah, yeah, that makes perfect sense. So yeah, I agree. It's talking about attentionality, right? It's the idea of instead of being reactive and it's so easy to be reactive and it can feel so productive to be reactive. When things come at us, come into our inbox or text and phone calls and we can just spend all day, you know, batting the balls back and forth that are coming out our way. And certainly we have to do that. And we also need to have a time where it's like, no, from this time to this time, I'm doing this other thing. And this other thing is to help me course correct so that I'm not just batting, you know, the customer service, you know, balls all day long. You know, I have to be prospecting. I have to be, you know, nurturing my database. And so those are the things that yeah, they're not as easy to get started. And also they're sometimes not as much fun. Right. That's the other part is that it isn't necessarily the most pleasurable tasks that are the most profitable. Right. And so that's the other thing is we think we also have to really get comfortable with the idea that discomfort is the part probably the pay, you know, the name of the game is how do we stay in distance? We're just comfort, healthy discomfort, you know, discomfort that's leading us to where we want to go. And that's not easy to step into that because you have to be willing to stand in the way of a bit of misery. And misery is the path. And because through misery, you, you know, you get stronger and you get better. And it's and then all of a sudden you're out of the misery. And you're you're reaping the rewards, but misery is the place you got to, you got to be willing to step into and it's not a funny lesson to hear. And I wish there was another way. No, but you know, it relates to working out, right? You go to the gym and then your sore. That's discomfort. But you, you earn that discomfort. That's good discomfort because tomorrow when you show up your body's healing, it's growing, it's changing and you're stronger. And so that thing that made you discomfort are uncomfortable in the beginning no longer makes you uncomfortable. And that's our brains are actually wired like that. The more that you do something that's uncomfortable, that part of your brain actually gets stronger. And so the next time you do it, it's not as uncomfortable. That's why, you know, you see these amazing public speakers on stage and their charismatic and charming and engaging with with with everybody or your podcast. There's no way your first podcast was as good as the one you, you're your last six. I eliminated it for my memory because it was so bad. Mine too. I go back and I look at the first one. I was like, oh my god, this was painful, but I got more and more comfortable. And I'm sure now you don't think about who's listening. You focus on the conversation and you, you kind of stay in the moment. And but you got there by doing that uncomfortable thing. So many times that it doesn't, I'm sure you don't get jitters anymore. You don't get the butterflies. You just, you're like, all right, I know what to do. Let's go. Like this is amazing. This can be fun. And it's, it's the same with all the aspects of our business. I agree. And I would also add to that to keep me honest that, you know, it's like you're going back to your workout metaphor. So every time I go to the gym, you know, for example, if I have to do a wall sit something that I'm not a fan of doing, I don't like that exercise. It's not enjoyable for me. None of the exercises are enjoyable, but that is one of the least enjoyable ones. It hurts. I have to hold it. It's this isometric exercise that I go basically almost until failure. So I'm almost like collapsing. And yet that's the path because that's how muscles get torn apart and they rebuild stronger. And then to keep my keep me honest is, yes, the next time maybe, maybe that particular amount of time is easier. But that means I have to do more to make it even harder. And I have to keep doing that to ratchet up to keep growing. And so, you know, back to this podcast, yeah, I don't get jitters, but what am I working on to make this even better for us. And the truth is that yeah, I could kind of phone it in because I've done it long enough. And I'm sure there's times where I have, if I'm, you know, if I'm being perfectly honest. And I don't want to do that. And I want to keep growing. So it's always this consistent, you know, return to discomfort that again, I wish it wasn't that way. I wish we just didn't have to, but it seems to be rewarded. It's rewarded by society. It's rewarded by ourselves. It's rewarded just in, you know, by industry. So again, it's, it's never the message I want to hear. You know, well said, I mean, and I appreciate the reframe is you're right. Like we, even if you, you have figured out even if you got the wall sit for 15 seconds now at 16. Yeah. And then it's 17, then it's 18. And then eventually it's like two minutes, three minutes. And you're like, oh my god, this is crazy. You're right. You're absolutely right. You do need, you need that continuous growth. And that's where when we're growing as humans, that's when we're typically the happiest. It's 100% those those really challenging experiences in our lives are usually that that moment after was the biggest growth we've had. Yeah, I totally agree. And I just thought came to me that I wanted to toss in, which is while I'm doing, for example, the wall sit and it's that, you know, higher level that I did from the previous day doing it or the previous time. I have to be, you know, I said this to my trainer a year or two ago, I said, oh, I'm never going to feel strong when I'm working out. She goes, that is correct. No matter how strong you actually are, you will never feel strong working out if you work out right away. And so it's kind of that that willingness to be like, oh, I'm not going. I'm always going to feel like there's another level to achieve, you know, and that to me is how really successful agents do it. It's not that they're down on themselves or they think they're worthless or they, you know, that I don't think is a good idea. I think shame really shuts us down. But if we can say, hey, here's where I'm at. Here's where I want to be. And I, and I'm always going to strive to get just a little bit 1% that 1% better. I think is such a good message. I'm so glad you share that because that's something we can, we can jump on. But we have to be willing to go, what's the discomfort that that 1% is going to entail. And I'm going to have to sit with it. But I'm going to have pride at the end of that. I'm going to also probably have results. And, and it's going to just, you know, continue to further my growth. Okay, tell us about the ping pong. I'd love to hear. So we talked about tourists and being the pilot as opposed to the tourist. Tell us about ping pong. The ping pong is, you know, this is a pattern that I've seen with, with agents who kind of started to figure it out. And I've done it myself in my career. Is the ping pong is you start doing that thing that really works for you. And then you become really successful in doing that one thing. But then you also become very busy. So then you recede from doing that one thing. And then the business comes down. And then you're like, shoot, shoot, shoot. I don't have any sales. I don't have a pipeline. So then you go back to doing that one thing or you try something new. And then that thing doesn't work. So then you try something else and that doesn't work. And then you go back to the thing that works. And you're like, wow, this really works. You do that thing a ton of times. Now you're again busy and successful. And you stop doing that thing. And so your, your business ricochets from having abundance to scarcity and back and forth and back and forth. And that really genuinely relates to systems and processes. And no one wants to talk about it because it's not sexy. But they don't have the system in the process of consistently doing that thing to gain new new contacts. And then having the system to follow up what's what's the actual workflow after that. And then again, going out and doing that activity again, say the open houses and then collecting those names. I can't even tell you how many agents are amazing. I'll use open houses as an example. They're amazing at collecting the names. And then they're like, well, the person didn't respond. So, you know, they're, they're tire kickers or you know, look, you lose or whatever they are. And I hate both of those phrases. And it's like, well, how many times did you follow up? Well, I sent them an email. Yeah. And you're like, well, how many times once? And so it's like, you need to system on the back end to do it more than once in the reality is marketing statistically, we need to hear about something seven to nine times before we actually engage with it. So the math is the reality is you're going to have to meet a hundred people to have a two percent conversion, meaning two closes a hundred people to have two closes. And you're going to have to follow up with a hundred people north of seven times. Yeah. And most people don't have that system in place. And so their business tends to ping pong is sadly what happens. And they also don't have the willingness. And again, I'm not this, you know, there before the grace of God, go, I am not, I am not dissimilar from this, but they don't have the willingness to say, I'm not going to see the result on the third call. In fact, if I do, it's a fluke, right on the third text, the third phone call the third email, if they somehow are like, let's start working together, I just got real lucky because it's really going to take probably even more than seven to nine touches, you know, might be 30. But this idea of I'm going to earn this. I'm going to earn this just like you earned your way into, you know, to some open houses. You have to earn it. And you know, sometimes you get lucky. And those are the ones that probably hurt people the most. Because they're so. Exactly. Yeah, they're so fun. The easy win. The easy win. And you're like, oh, this is easy. I only need to do it one time. But you know, to go back to the whole gym is how many times of you are how many people in the world have gone into a gym one time had an amazing workout. And they're like, they look into me and like, wow, I'm fit for life. Yeah, never happens. You have to go back, but not only go back, you have to go back consistently over time. And just because you get on the scale, and it's the same number, that doesn't mean that your body's not redoing a re composition, meaning your body fat is going down, but your muscle is going up. And so the scale is exactly the same. And so just because you don't see the difference, based on what you're measuring, it doesn't mean you're not getting the results. And I think that's, you know, you have that one easy hit. You get that you, you know, you meet that client at the open house and they write the offer on that property. And then you get lazy, you don't build the muscle. And so the muscle really is developed through the practice of the follow up. And it's not, it's not a pass fail. Just because they didn't respond. That doesn't mean you failed. You're just practicing your follow up. And then within the practice practice different follow ups. And never open an email. This is like the Bayne, my existence never open an email with them just following up. I hate that. Because you're fishing. Instead, listen to whatever the conversation was and then don't say I'm following up, but follow up with a piece of information that is then valuable to what they're wanting or needing. If you met them at a three bedroom and it wasn't a good fit for them. Hey, can you imagine yourself living here? Now, you know what? We really need a second bath. And you were able to collect the email. Well, then your follow up should be. Hey, I wanted to check in. I know this property wasn't a good fit because X, Y and Z, but I found this other one that's off market and it is. Did you want to hear more information about it? Yeah, that's great. It's it's this. I was thinking about you. Here's something that you might want and letting that be the guiding star versus, you know, I have to check this, you know, this is my fourth email. So I have to just keep it keep bugging you until eventually you break down and go, OK, let's talk. And you know, maybe that works. I don't know. I don't suspect it works very well. I think this providing value and going back to, you know, you're talking about ping pong versus systems or versus habits. You know, I might even say habits because habits are like, OK, I got the, I got the, you know, the easy win and now I got to go back and make all my dials and I have to go continue to, you know, do my customer service and I have to, you know, it's just consistently running running the same playbook and making adjustments when necessary. Of course, but just, you know, I talked to a top producer just last week and she, I said, what do you get just like you're saying, what are you doing right after this? So I always love to hear what top producers do during the day. She goes, oh, I have to make like an hour and a half of phone calls and I said, oh, OK, like what kind she goes, oh, they're my prospecting calls. I do it every single day. She's been in 20 years in the business. Love it said, I said, really? And she said, I have to she goes, I don't. It's the ping pong effect. You know, I'll be busy for a while and then I won't be. She's like, I can't not keep my pipeline full. So and I suspect she doesn't get, you know, a huge hit rate on those phone calls, but she knows that that's the, that's how you earn your way into somebody's into somebody's business. You know, again, it goes back to out of 100 people that you know that's in your database, only 2% are going to convert. That's just sales statistics, only 2% and so 98 of those phone calls are they're not, they're not useless. They're not useless. They're future business. Because not only that each person knows 3 other people who are thinking about making a move later that year. And so that's the gold and and just, you know, it's and I always use this word very carefully. I used it earlier when we said, but we don't make time. It's, that's an impossibility, but you can allocate time to do the thing. And in those top performers, they always allocate time and I think they also live by another rule. If you have to erase it, you must replace it. You have to put it somewhere else on your calendar. And and that's, you know, the calendar is another ping pong is the top performers that I'm sure you've seen this with your podcast. All the top performers use a calendar. They all show up when they have to be there. I can always tell when I'm doing a podcast recording who's now the top performer, just virtue of the emails that I get, hey, are we still on for Friday? Hey, I don't see the link here. It's like they're missing all of the cues along the way. Yeah, yeah, they don't have systems. And there he is. You know, I do, I had this thought and I don't think this is our listeners. So please, I'm not talking to you, the listener, but other people that maybe aren't listening. I think there's a lot of REALTORS, maybe the majority of them that don't actually keep a calendar. I don't mean top performers. They all do. But I mean everybody else. I suspect I think there's people in my personal life who are who are not REALTORS who don't keep a calendar. I maybe they just have amazing memories. I don't know, but I certainly don't. So I, I have to structure every hour of the day pretty much. And that doesn't mean I don't make adjustments. We all do. But I at least try to figure out what am I doing today? And what time and I have to write it down because I won't remember. Same. I, I cannot rely on my memory at all. And so our listing process, for example, there's a hundred and seven steps. There's a hundred and seven steps because I cannot remember when we have four listings. Well, if that one report was ordered for this specific property. So the, when you have systems and processes, those three AM wake up panics don't happen anymore because there's a place for everything and everything's in its place. Yeah. And you know, it's a good reminder for me to tighten up some of my systems as well, because that's that is a good. If you are having those Sunday scaries or whatever day of the week that is for you. It's, you know, I love that phrase. Yeah, I didn't come up with it. It's, it's, it's kind of out there in the, in the vernacular now. But I, I said so perfect because I know I know that feeling. It's probably because I haven't tightened up my process and I haven't created a repeatable system. So yeah, let's talk about racehorse. So we have, we had tourist. We have ping pong. Don't be a ping pong. You know, making sure that you're consistent with your, with your disciplined habits. And now tell us about racehorse. Yeah. So you got to have a plan is the, is the first thing and then you have this, you have to have a system to execute the plan and now the resource. The race or if you ever been to a race track, when I turned 30, my friends all decided to take me to the racetrack, which was super fun. We all like put on suits and the women wore sunglasses. And it was just like this is just such a cool event. But what's interesting is these race horses, they have a goal. Right. So they have the, they're not the tourists. They start at the start line and they, their, their goal is the finish line and not only that to finish first, but the fascinating part is, every horse has blinders on. And so now the jockey's goal is to keep the horse doing its job. And the blinders are now to keep the horse from getting distracted because if the horse doesn't have them. And they focused on the horse that left the horse on the right is going to pass. And if they're focused on the horse on the right, the horse on the left is going to pass. So they have blinders to keep from getting distracted. And so then they can only focus on that one goal. And I, I feel that because we have the autonomy to do whatever we want with our day, we don't put blinders on ourselves. We don't have the discipline and we tend to just get distracted. We sit in these meetings and we hear, you know, Joan over here is doing X, Y and Z. And you're like, I should be doing that. And then so you introduce more pinkongs. Now you don't have one ping pong. Now you got two. And then you're like, well, Mike over here is doing this thing. So now let me bring in another ping pong. And so now we've made ourselves really busy. We don't have a system to implement these ping pongs. And then we are now chasing more and more ping pongs and getting less and less results. And so it really boils down to you is you got to have a plan. You got to have the systems, but then you got to stay focused. And it's distractions that are really killing the business. And those agents who are succeeding on a high level, they have those blinders on. And you know, even going back to the agents leverage social media. How many set at timer to focus on lead generation on social media. But instead they actually just turn it into a scroll fast. And then the next thing, you know, two hours went by. And they're looking at like pictures of puppies. And so really having the discipline in your in your day to say, hey, I'm doing this thing right now. And I'm not going to be distracted by it. One of the simple things that we do is with the podcast, great example, is when I launched it, I decided that we're going to have a goal of, of X amount of months. And the goal is to get somebody subscribers or downloads. And then so we won't measure anything until that point. And within that, I need to have enough budget allocated for that project. And then I need to figure out who is going to execute what because I don't have time to add more ping pongs. And then I need to get a full list of things. My schedule is already full. And so now I have to figure out how to get some of these things off my plate. And that's the pre planning to a strategy, whatever your marketing strategy is, is having having the plan to it deciding things on the whim. Right. Not referring to your business plan is kind of the kiss of death. It's kind of like, you know, being a tourist in the gym. And it's like, if you went to the gym and said, I don't feel like doing wall sits today, but you did that over, you know, 20, 30, 40 days, your wall sits are not going to get any better and you're not going to develop that core strength. Because you didn't feel like it that day. And so again, having the blinders on. Or the coach, the mentor in your back pocket to say, hey, you really need to, this was your plan. Now you need to execute on it. Yeah. And having accountability. And I think, you know, that's where like you said, coach comes in accountability partner. If you can't do a coach, you just find another agent. Look, we're all struggling. We're all struggling in different ways. And so everybody's going to need accountability. You know, nobody does it all perfectly and getting somebody to help keep you on on task is, you know, obviously such a great, a great thing. And it's not a failure. I want to make sure if you're thinking, boy, I end up doing scrolling or I end up just infinitely scrolling because yeah, that's what it's designed to do. It's designed to make you do that. That's not even your fault. But there's a way around it. Right. And that's by having some sort of accountability where maybe you only allow yourself a certain number of minutes, you know, and having other other processes in place. But yes, the hard stuff is hard. The hard stuff is hard. Well said. Yeah. And I again wish it wasn't boy, I'll be my first question. If there is a creator and I get to meet the creator when I when I pass, I'll be like, why do you make all the good stuff so hard? But you probably hear, see, we'll probably say, well, yeah, it's what's supposed to be so. So it just is. That's kind of just reality. So, you know, look, you know, we also, I think, you know, just have to be really careful about technology, just capturing our attention when it's it's designed to, especially social media, is designed to capture our attention, because that's how it monetizes. So of course, it wants you infinitely scrolling like that's the best possible thing you can do for that service. And it's tricky because you probably have to post on social media. It's kind of like the person with the eating disorder trying to learn how to, you know, eat in a non disorderly way. That's not easy because you have to eat. So I get that the social media thing is really tricky. But if you keep falling into that hole, that's where you need to say, you know, I keep falling into this hole. I just have to see find a solution. And whether it's you put a timer on your phone that locks you out or you get somebody to, you know, just check in with, okay, for the next half an hour, I'm going to post, I'm going to connect with my audience. I'm going to write comments on there, you know, instead of consuming. I'm going to be proactive and do something, create content, whatever. And in 30 minutes, I'm going to call you. And I'm going to tell you how many of these I did, you know, or whatever, whatever the system is. You know, don't feel ashamed. Microphone struggles with, with infinitely scrolling and she's a super successful executive. So it's not, and she's one of the most disciplined people I know and she can't hardly do it. So, and that's how it's designed. I mean, it's, yeah, I could be addicted. And I think you make a really great point, DJ is, is to recognize, you know, to just be very honest with yourself. And it's hard to say, you know, I do scroll too much and I do have a problem with that, like, at least whatever it is in your business, just acknowledge it. And then whatever I commend is find a solution is maybe log out every time you are done or delete the app. So you have to re upload the app before, and then you have to log back in to go do the activity, make it a little bit harder. A really subtle trick for those watching this podcast is my phone is black and white. Because the colors make it more attractive to our community receptors. So if your phone is black and white, it loses the red numbers that jump up on all the apps. It's, it doesn't have the same appeal to our brain. And so the, the satisfying part of it goes away. And so there's, there's tons of little tricks you can get a product like, like, like, Lumly, for example, and you go to that platform and you put all of your social posts in there. And then you schedule them to go out. So you don't even have to actually physically go to that app. And then as a tree, this is where you know, program, the Pavlovian philosophy or strategy comes into play is listen, I'm going to sit down for 30 minutes and make past client calls. I'm just going to say, hey, I was thinking about you wanted to say hi at the end of 30 minutes reward yourself, set a timer for 10 minutes and doom scroll. Yeah. Create it as you know, pain and pleasure create a reward for doing the thing or, you know, you know, let's go back to working out. It was, I use that because it's easy for me because I did it for the bulk of my life. But if you're eating very disciplined for seven days a week, months on end, you get really, it gets really challenging. But if you have a cheat day. Yeah, like, sun that just a cheat meal. If a cheat day, if you fall off the fall off the, you know, you fall completely out of cheat day and it just really hurts you the next then make it a cheat meal or two cheat meals or whatever. Exactly. And but you then give yourself the reward or like, hey, you know, like I've been eating really disciplined all week. My friends birthdays this weekend. I'm going to have French rising beer. That just sounds amazing. And now it's a reward for the hard work. And so it's just, it's just creating these, it's stepping back and looking like where what area do I want to improve. How can I improve it? And then how do you, how do you change it? Or maybe you don't like making phone calls. Maybe that's not your thing. But maybe you have a really nice hot tub and you have a cell phone. So you know what? I'm going to go put on some cool music. I'm going to go hop in the hot tub. I'm going to fire it up. I'm going to, to cheat day. I'm going to pour glass of wine. And you know what? Then I'm going to make my calls. Yeah. What a great experience. Absolutely. What are you doing? I'm, you know what? I was relaxing in my hot tub. And I was just thinking about my past year. And I was thinking about how I helped you sell by that home or sell it. And I just wanted to say, I, and how grateful I am for the opportunity to work with you. Yes. And it's like you've changed the whole landscape of what that, what that looks like. I, you know, I have a home gym. And one of the ways I keep myself engaged is every once in a while. I'll be like, I really, really have to have this new piece of equipment. Okay, what's my goal? All right. I'm going to structure some sort of silly little goal for myself. And when I reach that goal, I'm going to get that product. I'm going to get that thing. And now I have like this new funding to play with. And so I think not making the word discipline a dirty thing, but make it like this happy engaging thing that has associated rewards with it. Yeah, I love that. Make, you know, change the environment of the, of where you're performing the unpleasant act and try to make it as pleasant as possible. And it's, you know, it's hard to feel depressed if you throw your shoulders back and you look up at you or even easier. It's hard to, to be depressed. Well, that's pretty easy. But it's hard to be depressed if you're feeling grateful about something. And so you know, well, I'm feeling depressed. I'm not grateful. Okay. Well, if you were grateful about something, what might that be? You certainly have something to be grateful about. Okay. That okay. Now come up with another thing. And another thing. And another thing. Yeah, it's past it. Like, like, hey, I'm grateful because I'm on this side of the, of the dirt. Like, let's start there. I'm thankful. I'm grateful that I can take a deep breath. And then you just, you build on, I'm thankful that I have a beautiful safe home environment. I'm thankful that I have food in my refrigerator. It's just start really simple and then build them there. And again, like I think if you add some body movement and some music, it's, it's really easy for us to downward spiral, you know, you should have a deal blowing up. You have, you know, clients pulling out, you have like a lot of bad stuff, but you can go back and re, re calibrate yourself. Our brains can't you cannot focus on being depressed and immensely grateful at the same time. It can't like the wiring, there's different parts of the brain. It's a totally different part of the brain. And just go back to what, like I'm grateful for this opportunity. It's a learning opportunity and it's a challenge, but I'm grateful that I'm having this moment right now because I'm going to learn something. What can I learn? And then it's, you change your reframing your perspective on that, that event, which sometimes it's really hard.
