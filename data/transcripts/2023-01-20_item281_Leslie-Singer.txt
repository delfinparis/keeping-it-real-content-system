[00:01:43] And just a moment, we're going to be speaking with top New York City agent,

[00:02:43] And now onto the main event, my conversation with Leslie Singer.
[00:02:56] Hey, today on the show, we have Leslie Singer,
[00:03:01] with the singer team with Brown Harris Stevens
[00:03:03] in New York City.
[00:03:05] Let me tell you more about Leslie.
[00:03:07] Now, Leslie is an award-winning broker
[00:03:09] and has consistently been one of Brown Harris Stevens'
[00:03:13] top performers leading a team that has repeatedly
[00:03:16] been number one in sales for the firm.
[00:03:19] She has also earned a reputation
[00:03:20] as one of the most approachable and loyal representatives
[00:03:23] in the industry.
[00:03:25] Leslie's track record of success is a function
[00:03:27] of her exceptional negotiation skills,
[00:03:30] tailored marketing solutions,
[00:03:31] and an innate ability to help clients navigate
[00:03:34] the complex New York real estate market.
[00:03:36] Her honors include winning the real estate board
[00:03:39] of New York Deal of the Year award,
[00:03:42] also being acknowledged as one of the top women
[00:03:44] in real estate by New York real estate journal,
[00:03:47] and being recognized as one of the top real estate teams
[00:03:50] nationwide by the Wall Street Journal.
[00:03:52] Born in bread in New York City,
[00:03:54] Leslie's informed, sophisticated sensibilities
[00:03:57] and her MBA background guide the team
[00:03:59] in preparing for transitions and transactions,
[00:04:03] discerning value and return on investment.
[00:04:06] Now, I want everybody to open up Instagram and TikTok
[00:04:09] and I want you to follow Leslie and her team.
[00:04:12] It's the same user name for both.
[00:04:15] It is singer, team, NYC, that's S-I-N-G-E-R.
[00:04:19] So singer, team, NYC, both Instagram and TikTok,
[00:04:23] and we will have a link to those in our show notes.
[00:04:26] You can click on those and follow
[00:04:27] because Leslie is doing some really, really cool stuff
[00:04:31] and her team on social, especially on TikTok,
[00:04:33] which she just got into, which we can talk about too.
[00:04:36] Anyway, Leslie, welcome to the show.
[00:04:38] Oh my God, thank you for having me,
[00:04:39] but now I, all of a sudden, I got nervous
[00:04:41] because there's accolades.
[00:04:44] I mean, now I've delivered to them.
[00:04:46] That's true. There's a lot of pressure to deliver.
[00:04:49] You know what, I'm going to say this at the beginning
[00:04:51] because since I just, you know, really,
[00:04:55] I'm so impressed with what you've done
[00:04:57] and I usually leave this to the end
[00:04:59] and then I realize not everybody makes it to the end.
[00:05:01] So before we actually start the interview,
[00:05:03] I mean, it's funny I've been doing this five years.
[00:05:06] You think it would have occurred to me sooner,
[00:05:07] but I guess better late, better late than ever.
[00:05:10] But if you are an agent in New York City
[00:05:13] and you are shopping around for maybe a new team, a new firm,
[00:05:18] maybe you think you could be a good asset to Leslie
[00:05:20] and her team, reach out to them and let's talk,
[00:05:24] have a conversation and maybe you could be a possible good fit
[00:05:27] for the singer team.
[00:05:29] So anyway, just wanted to throw that out there first.
[00:05:33] Except now they need to listen to see if they actually
[00:05:36] want to do that.
[00:05:37] Oh, they're going to want to work with you.
[00:05:39] I assure you, you are a big, big, big deal.
[00:05:43] And that's the other thing too is definitely, you know,
[00:05:47] that's why we're so excited to have you on the show.
[00:05:49] But let's, I would love to start.
[00:05:51] So what I don't really know is how you got started
[00:05:53] because I know you have this big success now.
[00:05:56] But everyone starts somewhere and I would love to hear
[00:05:59] about how and why you got into real estate.
[00:06:03] So I'll try and make it a shorter story than,
[00:06:08] but it was actually really interesting.
[00:06:11] My background is marketing.
[00:06:13] And I was the vice president of marketing
[00:06:15] for American movie classics.
[00:06:17] I had the dream job, truly a dream job.
[00:06:22] But I was flying all over the place and I ended up
[00:06:25] with these two little kids that like immediately,
[00:06:28] they're 17 months apart.
[00:06:30] And I couldn't be flying around the world
[00:06:32] and having two little little ones at home.
[00:06:36] So I really, really, really strategized
[00:06:40] about what my next steps were.
[00:06:42] And it was really hard to come to this decision.
[00:06:45] But I was like, huh, I have a marketing background,
[00:06:48] very, very strong marketing background.
[00:06:51] I have an MBA so I can do board packages
[00:06:54] and I love finances.
[00:06:57] And I grew up in Manhattan.
[00:06:59] I know it like the back of my hand.
[00:07:02] And if I were to go into real estate, I wouldn't be traveling.
[00:07:06] So I took the MBA and I took the marketing background,
[00:07:09] my knowledge in Manhattan and triangulated on real estate.
[00:07:14] So it was a very thoughtful and strategic decision
[00:07:19] for anyone that's starting out.
[00:07:22] And so that's how I came into the idea of real estate.
[00:07:25] And it was really truly for those reasons.
[00:07:28] And for anyone who's starting in real estate,
[00:07:31] I talked to a lot of firms when I was thinking about,
[00:07:36] starting my career and every firm has a very different
[00:07:41] corporate culture and a very different way of proceeding.
[00:07:45] And so it was really fascinating.
[00:07:47] And not only does each firm have a different corporate culture,
[00:07:50] but even within the firm, certain offices,
[00:07:53] within the same firm even have a different corporate culture.
[00:07:57] So I interviewed with a lot of different firms
[00:08:00] and the other thing I will say is having a mentor
[00:08:05] when you start is really, really, really important.
[00:08:09] So I met with someone at Brown Harris Stevens.
[00:08:14] I met with a manager, again,
[00:08:17] interviewed with a lot of different firms,
[00:08:18] but came upon some manager at Brown Harris Stevens
[00:08:22] who said, huh, I got a call.
[00:08:25] It was someone who was looking for an assistant
[00:08:30] who would bring me on and we would kind of did a handshake,
[00:08:34] but certain arrangements were made
[00:08:37] that I would cover all weekends, open houses,
[00:08:40] just to start and get the mentoring.
[00:08:43] And we said we would try it for six months.
[00:08:45] And six months turned into 18 years on a handshake.
[00:08:50] And everything was just above board.
[00:08:54] And it was, again, for me to learn,
[00:08:58] but within six months, it kind of became more of a partnership.
[00:09:01] And I really brought my marketing background
[00:09:04] to the whole process and marketed ourselves, branded ourselves.
[00:09:09] And it was great.
[00:09:12] So.
[00:09:13] Well, before I go into sort of how you got started
[00:09:17] and with that, because I think in particular,
[00:09:20] that marketing background is so incredibly useful
[00:09:23] for agents when they get, well, at any point in their career,
[00:09:26] but certainly when they get started,
[00:09:27] I was going to say with AMC,
[00:09:30] I'm going back to American Movie Classics.
[00:09:32] I always worship the, that the lists,
[00:09:36] I'm thinking of American Film Institute.
[00:09:37] Okay, American Film Classics is different.
[00:09:39] Sorry, I'm thinking of AFI who puts those lists together.
[00:09:41] So sorry, I was getting confused.
[00:09:43] But yeah, American Film Classics, yeah, big,
[00:09:45] you were AMC, I'm sorry, AMC.
[00:09:48] Yes, but yeah, I'm a big,
[00:09:50] God, I love American Movie Classics as well.
[00:09:53] The brand that they've built is impressive.
[00:09:56] But so.
[00:09:56] I mean, I was at Time Warner, I was at an ad agency.
[00:10:00] I mean, I really, I just, I loved what he did,
[00:10:03] but I have to say I'm equally passionate
[00:10:06] that I get to do, and it's a privilege to get to do
[00:10:09] what I do every day.
[00:10:11] And I imagine you get to sort of scratch the creative itch
[00:10:15] as well because with you get to be in full control
[00:10:18] of your branding, your marketing, your, your messaging.
[00:10:22] So does that sort of satisfy the part of you
[00:10:24] that loves being creative and?
[00:10:27] Oh, that, but I also have to say every deal
[00:10:30] and no two deals are alike,
[00:10:32] and you have to be creative in this industry
[00:10:35] and think outside the box, A, if you're promoting a property,
[00:10:38] how to differentiate, but also when it comes to a board package
[00:10:43] and someone's financials, and I'm not saying
[00:10:46] you have to be creative with their financials,
[00:10:48] but every deal has some sort of creative component
[00:10:52] of how to make the candidate the strongest possible
[00:10:56] presentation, et cetera.
[00:10:58] So I get creativity, and there's a lot of creativity
[00:11:03] in how I handle my clients, but we can,
[00:11:05] we can get into that too now or we can get into it later.
[00:11:09] Yeah, let's jump into it now.
[00:11:11] I'd love to hear about sort of how you approach clients.
[00:11:15] Well, first, actually, no, let's back up.
[00:11:16] I want to first find out about attracting clients
[00:11:19] because even though you've been doing this for a long time now
[00:11:23] in a really impressive career,
[00:11:25] everyone gets started with really no clients.
[00:11:29] And so I'm curious, how did you,
[00:11:31] when you first started 18 years ago,
[00:11:33] what were your strategies?
[00:11:35] I imagine you had some sort of fear of influence
[00:11:37] because you live, but New York is so transient
[00:11:40] that I don't know how much that helps,
[00:11:43] but you did grow up there.
[00:11:44] So I'm curious.
[00:11:45] Yeah, so I mean, interestingly enough,
[00:11:47] when you're first starting out,
[00:11:48] and yes, it was really important
[00:11:50] that I had a strong mentor behind me,
[00:11:52] which could show that there was someone
[00:11:54] with extreme knowledge and attract record as well,
[00:11:57] and then honestly, the Brown-Harris Stevens brand.
[00:12:01] So those are definitely great things
[00:12:03] to have in my back pocket,
[00:12:04] but you don't always want or nor do your friends
[00:12:08] want to work with a newbie, right?
[00:12:11] Oh, and they're buying a million dollar home.
[00:12:13] Oh, my friend just got a license a week ago.
[00:12:15] Exactly.
[00:12:16] And nor do they always want to show their finances to you, right?
[00:12:20] That's, you know, it is, I'm sorry to interrupt,
[00:12:23] but it is such, it is,
[00:12:24] that is something that nobody really has ever,
[00:12:27] we've done 430 episodes,
[00:12:29] and just that little piece that you said about,
[00:12:33] I've had lots of guests say,
[00:12:35] well, I didn't want to work with my friends
[00:12:36] because I was afraid I would screw things up
[00:12:37] or I was afraid to ask for their business.
[00:12:39] But the one thing I never thought about
[00:12:41] was what you just said, which is,
[00:12:43] I don't know what my friends earn.
[00:12:45] I don't.
[00:12:46] I've never asked them.
[00:12:47] I was taught not to ask.
[00:12:49] Right.
[00:12:49] And I was taught that any discussion of that
[00:12:51] was either considered braggadocia or being rude.
[00:12:55] So, yes, so that's really interesting.
[00:12:57] So that's a really strong point.
[00:12:58] So you add these people,
[00:12:59] but maybe you didn't feel so comfortable asking for business.
[00:13:04] Yeah, no, I mean, absolutely.
[00:13:06] And look, and again, being that I had someone in my, you know,
[00:13:09] like as almost a partnership in the beginning,
[00:13:12] I could offer that should they want to work with me,
[00:13:15] not only did they have the knowledge behind
[00:13:17] and the security of that,
[00:13:19] but that he could review their finances,
[00:13:21] but even that, like, felt, it just, you know,
[00:13:24] I understand their hesitation.
[00:13:27] But what I did do is in my little sphere of influence
[00:13:31] was I actually started like the old-fashioned way
[00:13:34] and I kind of went to 10 of my really, really good friends.
[00:13:39] And I asked each of them for 10 names
[00:13:42] of people that I could contact,
[00:13:44] just to start my own database.
[00:13:46] So, you know, that's only 100 people,
[00:13:49] but then those 10 people.
[00:13:50] So almost like, you know, those, what are they?
[00:13:53] Like male chain things that used to get.
[00:13:57] So that was one thing I did.
[00:13:59] And I started a newsletter,
[00:14:01] which was something that my mentor had been doing.
[00:14:04] But there was always a column that was singer says
[00:14:08] and it kind of talked about like the New York school system
[00:14:11] or, you know, those type of things that were
[00:14:17] New York-based, truly New York that showed
[00:14:19] that you had an insider- like, you know,
[00:14:22] influence on Manhattan.
[00:14:24] And we would mail the building's newsletters.
[00:14:27] And so, oh, that's interesting.
[00:14:30] So you would just blank it, man.
[00:14:31] Blanket, blanket, yeah.
[00:14:33] The part of my working at Time Warner was direct marketing.
[00:14:36] So I was like, let's do direct marketing.
[00:14:39] Let's do a newsletter.
[00:14:41] Let's, you know, and people held onto those newsletters.
[00:14:44] It was pretty great.
[00:14:46] So that was one of a couple of the things.
[00:14:50] Trying to take care of that.
[00:14:51] Can I pause you for a minute?
[00:14:53] I'm gonna tell you something that's gonna,
[00:14:55] that's not gonna surprise you,
[00:14:57] but also surprise you at the same time.
[00:15:00] Because, well, so I moved into a new development
[00:15:06] year and a half ago.
[00:15:07] And it's a nice building.
[00:15:09] There's 40 units, a town home.
[00:15:11] There's a few town homes.
[00:15:12] There's, but it's a nice building.
[00:15:15] And brand new development.
[00:15:16] Now, obviously, all of us who have purchased,
[00:15:19] probably not leaving any immediate time soon,
[00:15:22] but in a year and a half.
[00:15:24] So we're talking about sending out mailers,
[00:15:26] trying to establish your brand.
[00:15:29] At some point, all of us are probably gonna move.
[00:15:31] It's at some point, it's, it's, it's,
[00:15:34] it would be unlikely that our building people
[00:15:36] would live there for 40 or 50 years, although they could,
[00:15:38] but it's unlikely.
[00:15:40] So because of the neighborhood that we're in,
[00:15:42] and it's just one of those younger neighborhoods.
[00:15:46] Not one piece of mail from any REALTOR just saying,
[00:15:51] hey, you know, like obviously that would be a long-term play.
[00:15:55] They're probably like, well, if I'm gonna start mailing,
[00:15:57] I'm gonna be needing a mail for the next five to seven years.
[00:15:59] But why not?
[00:16:01] And what's amazing is not one piece of mail
[00:16:04] from any REALTOR in the last year and a half.
[00:16:06] And I don't think it's because people know
[00:16:08] that I'm in the business.
[00:16:09] I just think nobody's thought to do this.
[00:16:10] So I think even that's kind of a lost art these days,
[00:16:14] and there's so much opportunity.
[00:16:15] So I just wanted to mention that.
[00:16:17] I think people are cutting back on mailing, right?
[00:16:21] Cause we have social media, we have everything else,
[00:16:23] but it is a really great way to cut through the clutter.
[00:16:26] And when I do a new listing,
[00:16:28] I'm mail the neighborhood.
[00:16:30] And I mail the building as well,
[00:16:32] because people who love your building, like you,
[00:16:35] you may not be ready to sell,
[00:16:37] but you may know someone who wants to buy there.
[00:16:40] Because you love the building
[00:16:42] and they come to visit you.
[00:16:43] Yeah, of course.
[00:16:44] So like it's just another way to keep yourself top of mind.
[00:16:48] You also said something else,
[00:16:50] and I apologize for like interrupting you
[00:16:52] every few moments.
[00:16:52] You said something that at first I sort of was like,
[00:16:55] I didn't understand it.
[00:16:57] And then as you were talking, it made sense.
[00:16:59] And this is such a, this is, no, no, this is a thing nobody else
[00:17:03] has said either, which was, so there used to be this old sales
[00:17:07] technique at the closing table or whether you're selling a car
[00:17:11] or a house or whatever, the old salesman 101 was like,
[00:17:14] by the way, I'd like the name of three of your friends.
[00:17:17] Now, that, and nobody likes that, right?
[00:17:19] We all are like, yeah, but what you did was much smarter
[00:17:24] and definitely works and it isn't uncomfortable,
[00:17:27] which is you go to your friends and you say,
[00:17:30] hey, I'm starting my business.
[00:17:32] I'm not obviously, you know, if you know someone who wants to buy
[00:17:34] yourself, obviously I'd love to talk to him,
[00:17:36] but I would just love to get introduced to some of your friends.
[00:17:39] And basically that's what you were asking.
[00:17:41] And that's just called networking.
[00:17:44] And I just want to make, I just want to make sure
[00:17:46] that anyone listening, that is a really smart strategy
[00:17:50] because your friends are the ones that want you to succeed.
[00:17:53] And you're not asking them to like, you know,
[00:17:55] you're not really asking them for much.
[00:17:57] You're not asking for a sale, you're not asking them for it.
[00:18:00] Now, no, no, it's just like, who do you think would be
[00:18:02] really good for me to reach out to and talk to you for milk?
[00:18:05] It's brilliant.
[00:18:06] It's brilliant.
[00:18:07] And I know if somebody asked me, I mean,
[00:18:09] it's such a simple thing, but no, really people
[00:18:12] don't do this very often, I don't think.
[00:18:14] If somebody, if one of my friends were to say,
[00:18:16] I'm starting this XYZ business, whatever it is,
[00:18:19] hey, could you give me some names of people that might
[00:18:22] in the future maybe be a candidate for me?
[00:18:24] I just want to put them on my list or reach out.
[00:18:26] I wouldn't hesitate.
[00:18:27] I'd be like, of course I will.
[00:18:29] Like, no big deal.
[00:18:30] Yeah, no one is asking a client at the closing table.
[00:18:34] That one feels more uncomfortable than this.
[00:18:36] It is.
[00:18:37] It's a definitely.
[00:18:38] I agree.
[00:18:40] I just wanted to honor you for a couple of those,
[00:18:42] those really, though, it's always the small things, right?
[00:18:46] Like people say things on the show and all of a sudden,
[00:18:49] like they just kind of go past it
[00:18:51] because they don't realize how important I think that is.
[00:18:54] And I'll be like, oh, stop, stop.
[00:18:56] You just, so you've done that a several times.
[00:18:57] So I promise to not interrupt as much anymore.
[00:19:00] No, no, I appreciate that.
[00:19:02] The other thing was I noticed this happened when my,
[00:19:08] when my children were in nursery school,
[00:19:11] and we were implying for kindergarten,
[00:19:13] a lot of my, the parents would talk to me because I grew up in Manhattan
[00:19:17] about the different schools.
[00:19:19] And I only went to one or two of them, right?
[00:19:23] But they would ask me, and I had a general knowledge
[00:19:26] of the school system.
[00:19:28] And I was like, huh, why don't I give back?
[00:19:31] And this is in my first year of real estate.
[00:19:33] Why don't I give back to the community
[00:19:36] and by hosting seminars about the school system?
[00:19:41] And so we would, I would have a getting into kindergarten school
[00:19:46] panel and a getting into nursery school,
[00:19:49] which is a huge thing in Manhattan.
[00:19:51] I would have these panel discussions
[00:19:53] and I would bring in not only parents,
[00:19:57] but guidance counselors.
[00:19:59] And yes, they have them for nursery school.
[00:20:00] Yes, they have them for kindergarten.
[00:20:02] But it was my way to give back to the community
[00:20:04] with also the self-serving idea
[00:20:07] that these people will be making a decision shortly
[00:20:11] once they know where their child is getting into school
[00:20:14] as to where they want to live.
[00:20:17] So then.
[00:20:19] I love that.
[00:20:20] And here in Chicago, I don't know if,
[00:20:23] you know, I'm not a parent myself,
[00:20:25] so I don't know if those exist.
[00:20:26] I have not, I've heard of REALTORS doing,
[00:20:29] so you want to buy a condo, so you want to buy a first home.
[00:20:32] Those seminars happen, those are pretty common.
[00:20:36] I've not heard about school
[00:20:38] and that is every new parents sort of big,
[00:20:41] one of their biggest issues is where,
[00:20:43] especially in a big city,
[00:20:44] where is my child going to go to school,
[00:20:45] where the safe areas, what are the best,
[00:20:50] academics, et cetera.
[00:20:51] That's real smart.
[00:20:52] Now I do it through college,
[00:20:54] because that's kind of as my kids got older
[00:20:56] and I had more knowledge
[00:20:57] and we still, we do college seminars as well.
[00:21:01] Wow.
[00:21:02] And I have to say it's fun for me.
[00:21:04] It shows how old I am,
[00:21:05] but there are clients that I helped with the nursery
[00:21:09] that I've also helped with the college.
[00:21:12] I mean, it's.
[00:21:12] Isn't that incredible?
[00:21:13] Yeah, all the way through.
[00:21:15] Yeah.
[00:21:16] Well, my sister and I both went to Miami University
[00:21:19] out in Ohio, Miami of Ohio,
[00:21:22] and then my sister ended up in New York City.
[00:21:24] They actually have a pretty strong alumni,
[00:21:29] contingency there in New York,
[00:21:31] which is surprising whenever I met people in Ohio
[00:21:34] that went to Miami, that were from New York.
[00:21:37] I was like, how did you find out about this,
[00:21:41] really, we should be in Florida,
[00:21:42] we're in a middle of Ohio.
[00:21:44] 
[00:21:45] And yeah, but anyway, that's, that is amazing.
[00:21:47] So you still do those.
[00:21:49] You still do, you're just,
[00:21:50] and you go all the way,
[00:21:51] you still do all the way from nursery school up through college.
[00:21:53] You know, we've really, we've been really focused more
[00:21:55] on the college because again,
[00:21:57] it's a life cycle and it's a really nice way to give back
[00:22:00] and eventually people will think about,
[00:22:06] you know, my home is larger than I need, right?
[00:22:10] As their kids go off to college.
[00:22:12] So, well, just even, just even planning for college
[00:22:16] with 529 plans and the financial part of it is,
[00:22:19] is so daunting and so scary for new parents,
[00:22:24] that it's something that they have to start thinking
[00:22:26] about pretty much right away.
[00:22:29] 
[00:22:30] Yeah.
[00:22:30] Yeah, in utero, it's, yeah, I, I, yes,
[00:22:35] my, my one nephew is five.
[00:22:38] And so he's got some time, but my, my sister's all,
[00:22:42] they've already figured it all out.
[00:22:43] It's already all figured out and I was like, good for them.
[00:22:46] Yeah.
[00:22:47] Yeah.
[00:22:48] But so, so that, that is a really smart strategy
[00:22:52] because again, you are giving back,
[00:22:54] you're contributing, you're providing value.
[00:22:57] And then, oh, and oh, by the way, I'm also a REALTOR.
[00:23:00] So, well, and, you know, and my,
[00:23:04] my, finding the perfect fit for school
[00:23:06] is very similar to finding a perfect fit
[00:23:09] for your family and a building.
[00:23:11] And the application process of a applying for these schools
[00:23:15] is not that different.
[00:23:17] Of course, you're not showing all your financials,
[00:23:19] but you still have an application process
[00:23:21] for getting into a school.
[00:23:22] You have an application process for, you know, a co-op.
[00:23:26] So, there were so many similarities, but again,
[00:23:30] and it wasn't, it was a nice way for me to give back
[00:23:34] with a minor ask, right?
[00:23:36] So, it felt good.
[00:23:38] And so you bring in, you said you bring in guidance counselors.
[00:23:41] Do you ever bring in representatives
[00:23:42] from the schools themselves?
[00:23:44] I have done that and I've done parents.
[00:23:47] So you have a really, really nice range of people.
[00:23:51] 
[00:23:51] That is such a great idea.
[00:23:53] I love that.
[00:23:54] So, wow.
[00:23:55] I think it's really important.
[00:23:57] And I think it's really important to really think about
[00:24:00] what's authentic and genuine to you
[00:24:04] with whatever you do, because people will,
[00:24:08] they can feel it, they can sense it.
[00:24:10] And it's really where you're coming from
[00:24:15] the most honest place.
[00:24:17] And I think it's great for connecting.
[00:24:20] So I would say to anyone starting out,
[00:24:22] think about what's really authentic and genuine to you
[00:24:26] and follow that.
[00:24:27] So, that was, that was her places for me.
[00:24:32] That felt really good.
[00:24:34] Yeah, it makes all the sense in the world.
[00:24:37] I also want to go back to this idea of open houses,
[00:24:40] because I feel like that too is so easily like,
[00:24:44] yeah, yeah, yeah, sit open houses,
[00:24:46] but it's not, maybe it doesn't sound very exciting
[00:24:48] to talk about, but I would say that almost every guest
[00:24:52] I've had on it, I only really interview
[00:24:55] top 1% producers.
[00:24:57] They all love, and they all started doing open houses
[00:25:00] for other agents and learning how to talk to clients
[00:25:04] as they walk in and out, how to, you know,
[00:25:06] understanding how to have conversations about real estate,
[00:25:09] how to talk to clients, understanding their needs,
[00:25:12] how important was it for you to do a lot of those reps,
[00:25:16] sort of going to the gym almost of open houses,
[00:25:19] how critical is that for you?
[00:25:20] So for me, those weekend open houses,
[00:25:23] where I took over our listings and had the open houses,
[00:25:27] those were really, really, really critical.
[00:25:30] And I will tell anyone, even if you are representing a property,
[00:25:35] you should have and know inside and out
[00:25:39] all the other competitive properties,
[00:25:41] because when you get someone at that open house
[00:25:44] and you say to them, because it's a really critical question,
[00:25:47] does this work for you?
[00:25:49] And they're like, nah, you know what, this or that,
[00:25:51] and then you can say, this may not work for you,
[00:25:54] but how about this?
[00:25:55] I think you should look at this.
[00:25:58] May I make an appointment for you?
[00:26:00] So know your competition and turn that person,
[00:26:03] if they're not, they're not gonna be the buyer for your property,
[00:26:07] turn them into a buyer for another property.
[00:26:09] It's a art and it's a great opportunity.
[00:26:14] So yes, those open houses were really, really, really important.
[00:26:18] The other thing is when other brokers are holding open houses,
[00:26:23] go to as many open houses as possible and learn the market,
[00:26:28] whether it's a one bedroom, a studio, a two bedroom,
[00:26:31] a five bedroom, because inevitably you'll be at a cocktail party
[00:26:35] and you'll be, oh, you know, oh, you're interested
[00:26:38] on the upper East Side, I saw this great two bedroom
[00:26:41] the other day, right?
[00:26:43] Like, it's just get to know the market and it doesn't matter.
[00:26:47] I mean, I've been doing this so many years
[00:26:50] and I still go to open houses so I can see what's out there.
[00:26:54] So, and also too, it's great.
[00:26:56] I don't love the word networking because I just feel like
[00:26:58] that I don't even know it and always what that means.
[00:27:01] But this idea of going to these broker open houses
[00:27:03] allows you to interact with other REALTORS.
[00:27:08] And there's a real practical reason to do this,
[00:27:11] even other than just being front and friendly and nice.
[00:27:14] And then you learn the market and you learn the market.
[00:27:17] You learn the market.
[00:27:18] You know, when I'm talking to other brokers
[00:27:20] and I'm going to the open house,
[00:27:22] inevitably there's a discussion of like,
[00:27:24] you know, what are you seeing?
[00:27:26] You know, how, you know, how are you finding the market?
[00:27:28] This is what I'm experiencing.
[00:27:30] And there's also the great discussion of,
[00:27:33] hey, I'm bringing this on.
[00:27:36] Do you know anyone or, you know,
[00:27:40] I, someone doesn't want to list this,
[00:27:42] but they're thinking about listing it.
[00:27:43] Would you have any?
[00:27:44] Well, I mean, there are so many dialogues
[00:27:47] that are important.
[00:27:49] Plus just have your face out there, of course.
[00:27:51] Well, and I imagine too, like during the pandemic,
[00:27:54] for example, when, well, once, once the sort of pandemic
[00:27:58] was subsiding and people, you know,
[00:28:02] the interest rates were so low
[00:28:03] and everyone was trying to buy,
[00:28:05] I imagine it doesn't hurt going to an open house,
[00:28:09] you know, at some point introducing yourself
[00:28:11] to the other agent, making nice with them,
[00:28:13] developing some sort of friendship
[00:28:15] or relationship, professional friendship with them.
[00:28:17] Probably doesn't hurt then when they see
[00:28:19] out of the 30 offers they just received,
[00:28:22] when they see a friendly, a name that they recognize.
[00:28:25] And like, I know this, this woman, she's awesome.
[00:28:28] I met her at an open house.
[00:28:29] She seems great.
[00:28:30] It probably doesn't hurt at getting a little bit more attention
[00:28:34] on that, on the offer.
[00:28:35] Now you're absolutely right about that.
[00:28:38] I'm working on a transaction right now
[00:28:40] and the offer was accepted, honestly,
[00:28:44] probably a good six to eight weeks ago,
[00:28:48] of which we still haven't gone to contract.
[00:28:50] And I represent the purchaser
[00:28:53] and the broker on the other side is like,
[00:28:55] thank God it's you.
[00:28:57] Thank God it's you.
[00:28:58] I know we're gonna get there.
[00:29:00] Yeah, because of you.
[00:29:01] And she said, you know, never in my 40 years
[00:29:03] have I experienced this, but like, you know,
[00:29:06] so to your point, making contact,
[00:29:10] making connections, just as someone,
[00:29:13] when it deal comes together, they have a name and a face
[00:29:16] and they feel good about it is really truly important.
[00:29:23] I'm curious too, because you've been in this industry
[00:29:26] almost 20 years, you've seen a lot of agents come and go,
[00:29:29] you've seen as you've been building your business
[00:29:33] and your team, what are some of the mistakes
[00:29:35] that you see agents making as they are trying
[00:29:39] to build their business?
[00:29:40] Or, and there's so many mistakes that agents make.
[00:29:44] But what we try to do on the show is help agents avoid
[00:29:47] some of those pitfalls.
[00:29:49] So is there anything that comes to mind?
[00:29:51] I mean, aside from like not working hard enough,
[00:29:54] yes, that's usually the main reason I find
[00:29:57] that people tend to exit the industry,
[00:30:00] but it isn't always that.
[00:30:01] And sometimes people just make, you know,
[00:30:04] decisions that they could have made differently.
[00:30:05] So is there anything that you sort of see agents
[00:30:09] any mistakes that agents make that really they,
[00:30:12] that could be avoided, anything that comes to mind?
[00:30:16] God, I have to think about this for a second, mistakes.
[00:30:21] I think sometimes when you're young and you're hungry,
[00:30:28] you want the deal more than you,
[00:30:32] like you know, you want it too much
[00:30:35] and you lose sight of your client
[00:30:38] and you push for a deal and I think a lot gets lost there
[00:30:41] and your relationships are so important
[00:30:45] that you can't want the deal more than your own client.
[00:30:49] And, you know, deals are gonna come and go
[00:30:51] and they're gonna come together
[00:30:52] or they're gonna fall apart or whatever,
[00:30:54] but making sure that your client feels really attended to
[00:31:00] throughout.
[00:31:01] So really spending that time and not thinking of it
[00:31:04] is just like a one deal and then you're onto the next
[00:31:06] because you build your business by clients
[00:31:10] referring to you are coming back to you
[00:31:13] and don't make something like a one trick pony.
[00:31:16] Yeah.
[00:31:17] So that's really, really good advice.
[00:31:20] And I'm curious to with the amount of time
[00:31:24] and the number of deals that you have done,
[00:31:28] how important is it to anticipate your client's needs
[00:31:34] or their mental state?
[00:31:35] And I don't mean, you know, whether they're sane
[00:31:37] or insane, I mean, they're anxiety, they're fears,
[00:31:41] they're joy that how critical is it to be able
[00:31:45] to manage those expectations and those emotions
[00:31:48] for your clients?
[00:31:50] Because I know every time I've purchased a sold property,
[00:31:54] something always goes wrong, there's always a moment
[00:31:56] where I'm like, well, something's gonna,
[00:31:58] this is all falling apart, this is all going to be
[00:32:00] a big disaster and then, you know, it isn't,
[00:32:04] but the stress of that is real.
[00:32:07] And I'm curious about how you help your clients
[00:32:10] through those difficult, you know, moments of a transaction.
[00:32:14] Well, so there's, I mean,
[00:32:16] you bring up a really, really important point,
[00:32:18] which is a, every deal has a moment, every single,
[00:32:23] every single deal has a moment.
[00:32:26] Like there's, you know, and you never know when it's gonna happen,
[00:32:29] but it's kind of like when it happens,
[00:32:30] like, here it is, and you work through it.
[00:32:35] I try to, the best of my ability to always handle
[00:32:42] all those moments without including my client.
[00:32:46] So I try, I take on the stress and try and navigate
[00:32:50] to get to the right answer without having to stress them out
[00:32:54] and only go to them at those really critical moments
[00:32:57] that I'm like, I can't do it without, you know,
[00:33:01] including them, but I do think you spend time
[00:33:05] with the client upfront and, you know,
[00:33:08] just in your dialogue of getting to know them
[00:33:10] of, is this a life transition, right?
[00:33:14] So you come into people's lives,
[00:33:16] whether they're having, getting married, having a baby,
[00:33:21] you know, it's their first time purchase,
[00:33:23] some are getting divorced, sometimes it's death,
[00:33:26] sometimes it's in a state sale and getting to know
[00:33:29] what their objectives are, but where they are
[00:33:31] in their life cycle and understanding that
[00:33:35] will help you navigate with them and listening
[00:33:39] throughout the entire process.
[00:33:42] You'll get to a sense whether this is someone
[00:33:45] who makes a really quick decision,
[00:33:47] this is someone who needs more handholding,
[00:33:49] this is someone who needs to see 25 properties,
[00:33:52] they only need to see five, you know.
[00:33:54] So it's a lot of listening and there's a lot of handholding
[00:33:59] and there are times when you're a therapist, right?
[00:34:01] Because you're dealing with someone's largest asset,
[00:34:06] they've exposed everything, you know,
[00:34:09] they've told their life story in a board package,
[00:34:11] they've shown all their financials, they're extremely anxious,
[00:34:14] they started envisioning themselves in the property,
[00:34:18] you know, and for whatever their reason is for their transition,
[00:34:22] that comes to play.
[00:34:24] So, and they're for sellers, that's a really emotional time.
[00:34:28] They may have brought up their whole family there
[00:34:31] and they're selling because they don't need that family
[00:34:34] how many more, but it's still emotional,
[00:34:37] even if they're excited about where they're going,
[00:34:39] it's still emotional or, you know, if it's a death
[00:34:41] or whatever divorce.
[00:34:45] So yes, a transition's in getting to know your client,
[00:34:49] but I really, there are a couple of things I do,
[00:34:51] which is I try and understand that client really well
[00:34:55] in the beginning and I listen, but I really respect someone's time.
[00:35:00] So I try, if I'm working with a buyer,
[00:35:04] I try and identify before we even go out,
[00:35:08] five to 10 properties that I think are going to be a perfect fit.
[00:35:12] I line those five properties up in a row, get a car and driver.
[00:35:17] So I only take them out of their day to day
[00:35:20] for maybe an hour and have to two hours.
[00:35:23] And then we can kind of have a conversation after that,
[00:35:26] like what worked, what didn't work,
[00:35:28] and then I can refine the search that much more,
[00:35:31] but I'm always sensitive to someone's time.
[00:35:34] Can I ask about doing showings?
[00:35:37] This is such a simple question.
[00:35:38] Everybody does them differently.
[00:35:41] Do you visit the properties before your client?
[00:35:44] I love previewing.
[00:35:47] I love to preview a property.
[00:35:51] A, it allows me to eliminate if I don't think it's going to be appropriate,
[00:35:57] but B, when I get to that property,
[00:35:59] and I think it is the right fit because I've previewed it,
[00:36:02] it not only gives me ability to be comfortable in the show,
[00:36:06] but I have a lot of knowledge and I can point out to my client,
[00:36:10] and the things that I know are important priorities for them.
[00:36:16] So whether it's closet space or whatever it may be,
[00:36:20] I know that that's important to them and I can help highlight it.
[00:36:23] So I love previewing.
[00:36:26] So whatever possible preview?
[00:36:28] In my opinion, yes, it takes extra time, but it's so worth it.
[00:36:33] And that property that you see that your previewing
[00:36:36] may not be right for the client you had in mind,
[00:36:39] but I promise you somewhere in the next kind of like discussions
[00:36:44] you're having, all of a sudden,
[00:36:46] and it could be three weeks later,
[00:36:47] and that property hopefully still on the market,
[00:36:49] you're like, oh my God, the property that I saw for so and so,
[00:36:53] that wasn't right is totally right for someone else.
[00:36:55] There's no waste of time.
[00:36:58] It worked.
[00:36:58] I guess what we're really talking about is learning the inventory.
[00:37:02] I mean, as simple as it sounds,
[00:37:04] and inventories, of course, always changing,
[00:37:06] but this idea of being a master of the inventory
[00:37:10] is really so critical.
[00:37:13] It's not, hey, I'm gonna go on this journey with you
[00:37:16] and we're gonna walk into this home together and check it out.
[00:37:19] It's, I'm gonna go on the journey first.
[00:37:21] I'm gonna check everything out so that I can bring back.
[00:37:24] And it's a simple thing, but I don't know
[00:37:28] that most agents even preview properties.
[00:37:31] I think they, a lot of them show up with their client.
[00:37:33] And, you know, and that is,
[00:37:36] that's really not the, it gets just my opinion,
[00:37:40] but it's not really the best client experience that way,
[00:37:43] I believe.
[00:37:44] Yeah, I think, you know, I think,
[00:37:45] look, everybody has a different,
[00:37:49] a different way of handling their business.
[00:37:52] Again, it gives me the confidence walking in
[00:37:54] that I feel like it is really right.
[00:37:55] I can show it better even though I'm not the shower,
[00:37:59] the listing agent might be the shower,
[00:38:00] but again, it's just, as you said,
[00:38:05] getting to know the inventory is just so critical.
[00:38:08] I wanna, I wanna go ahead, I'm sorry.
[00:38:11] No, no, no, just recently there was a home that I had previewed.
[00:38:16] I thought it was absolutely like the perfect fit,
[00:38:20] brought the couple, the wife looks at me and she's like,
[00:38:24] oh my God, I love this, I love this.
[00:38:26] But there was something in the husband's face
[00:38:28] that I was like, mm-hmm.
[00:38:31] And I came back to work a couple of days later
[00:38:33] and I said, look, you know, I sent you this listing
[00:38:37] and you said you weren't interested in seeing it
[00:38:39] for the following reasons, but I noticed your husband's reaction
[00:38:43] and I actually think this will appeal to him more
[00:38:46] and she's like, huh, okay, let's go.
[00:38:48] And that's the one they bought.
[00:38:50] Yeah.
[00:38:51] So it's like just, you know, you have to also be present
[00:38:55] when you're showing at the show.
[00:38:58] You have to pay attention.
[00:39:00] And it's actually, and so in that probably being
[00:39:05] that the physical space isn't new to you at that moment
[00:39:09] because you've already previewed it,
[00:39:10] you now can focus your attention on their reaction
[00:39:13] versus what's actually going around visually.
[00:39:17] I can really be in the comment.
[00:39:19] Exactly.
[00:39:20] That is an important tip.
[00:39:23] And so maybe that's even the best reason of all to preview.
[00:39:27] Is well, there's lots of crit reasons.
[00:39:29] Learn the property.
[00:39:31] It allows you to really be watching the content.
[00:39:34] Yeah.
[00:39:35] You know, you're so right because I know for me
[00:39:38] any shiny object, you know, captures by attention.
[00:39:41] And so if I'm walking in somewhere for the first time
[00:39:44] I'm looking around and seeing everything visually.
[00:39:47] And of course, that's what the client is going to be doing
[00:39:49] and you're really watching them
[00:39:51] what instead of, you know, being taken in yourself
[00:39:54] by everything.
[00:39:55] And that is, again, it's a simple thing
[00:39:57] but not every REALTOR thinks about that.
[00:40:00] And that is really, we're talking about professionalism,
[00:40:02] I think, and being professional.
[00:40:04] And that is such a great idea.
[00:40:08] So thank you for that.
[00:40:10] And another question, I want to just switch gears a little bit
[00:40:14] because you were telling me just before we got on,
[00:40:17] Leslie and I were talking about,
[00:40:19] I am so jealous because I live in Chicago
[00:40:22] and we are the second city.
[00:40:25] And New York is probably the first city.
[00:40:29] And so I live in a very wonderful place
[00:40:33] but I'm so jealous because New York is such a lovely place.
[00:40:36] And we were talking about all things New York.
[00:40:38] I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor
[00:40:42] or one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss.
[00:40:45] Now after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS

[00:41:56] And now back to our episode.
[00:42:00] But you were telling me that you just recently had
[00:42:02] some success on social media with TikTok
[00:42:05] and you know this is really interesting
[00:42:09] because I've been doing the show for five years
[00:42:11] and no one's talked TikTok yet.
[00:42:14] And I'm not asking you to to give away
[00:42:18] any secrets or any but we are starting to see
[00:42:22] REALTORS now embrace TikTok which is being used of course
[00:42:25] by you know the demographic of TikTok users
[00:42:29] are excused younger.
[00:42:31] And so I'm curious on what you're doing there
[00:42:34] and what sort of results you're seeing
[00:42:36] because you just had a big success there.
[00:42:38] Yeah.
[00:42:40] So I've been doing Instagram you know
[00:42:44] obviously for quite a while now
[00:42:45] and I have a team that helps and supports me
[00:42:48] and I kept saying think we really need to be on TikTok.
[00:42:51] Think we really need to be on TikTok
[00:42:53] and they're like yeah you know it's new.
[00:42:55] And I'm like so I'm maybe even be late to the game
[00:43:00] because I keep I was harping on this
[00:43:02] but we really only started a couple of weeks ago.
[00:43:06] And again I'm doing things that are truly, truly genuine to me
[00:43:10] and really comfortable for me usually around the prop
[00:43:14] it's around properties.
[00:43:16] Although as I mentioned to you I just happened to do one
[00:43:18] around hot chocolate because I do like to bring in
[00:43:22] a little bit of lifestyle and like things that are popping up
[00:43:25] in Manhattan that could be useful to bits
[00:43:29] but they're usually centered around a property
[00:43:33] that I'm promoting and just having a ton of fun with it
[00:43:38] but like you know again it's really really new to me
[00:43:41] and this one particular video went viral
[00:43:44] and we have like now 270,000 hits on it
[00:43:47] and I'm like okay so and I'll just share with you
[00:43:51] that my son who's 25 he's like hey mom
[00:43:55] my friends are loving you on TikTok
[00:43:58] and they say so you're so professional.
[00:44:01] Hey mom I didn't even know you were on TikTok
[00:44:03] and he goes I don't have TikTok.
[00:44:06] I'm so excited.
[00:44:07] 
[00:44:08] Hey mom stay out of my friends TikToks.
[00:44:11] But I wasn't there blocked or they're following me
[00:44:14] it wasn't like you know.
[00:44:16] But isn't that amazing if you put out good quality content
[00:44:19] or fun content entertaining content whatever it might be
[00:44:23] it can you know we do have a ways you know
[00:44:27] we do have the opportunity now with technology
[00:44:29] where things can spread and it's all about value
[00:44:34] and so I imagine TikTok is as well as Instagram
[00:44:38] is fun for you because with your marketing background
[00:44:41] you get to really project what I am I'm curious to about
[00:44:47] how you stay in touch with clients in between their sales
[00:44:53] right so somebody buys a co-op
[00:44:55] there maybe they're gonna live there for X number of years
[00:44:59] how are you staying in touch with them in between?
[00:45:02] Yeah so then that's always a really hard thing
[00:45:04] because you're really really busy with your day to day
[00:45:06] so I do do a monthly newsletter
[00:45:10] and sometimes it's not you know as frequent
[00:45:12] sometimes it's more frequent if it's important
[00:45:15] but I definitely do a monthly newsletter.
[00:45:19] I really love my clients like I really really love my clients
[00:45:23] so fortunately that means having coffee with them
[00:45:27] having a lunch you know having a drink
[00:45:30] and it may not be as you know sometimes
[00:45:32] you can do it more frequently
[00:45:34] everyone schedules really really busy
[00:45:36] but your clients sometimes become your really good friends
[00:45:40] sometimes you know as I said summer with me forever
[00:45:43] and repeat business and then it's little things
[00:45:47] like just reaching out and following up
[00:45:51] you know how are you enjoying your apartment
[00:45:53] love to see it love to drop by you know
[00:45:57] and then I do every now and then I don't do holiday gifts
[00:46:01] because they get lost in the clutter
[00:46:04] but I will pick a different time of year to do a gift
[00:46:07] and do a mailing of a gift
[00:46:08] so and it could be you know years we've did champagne
[00:46:13] it's just another way of just saying you know thinking of you
[00:46:17] and usually for the first year when someone buys from me
[00:46:23] they'll get like wine of the month
[00:46:25] so each month or depending on who they are
[00:46:28] maybe it's flowers each month so each month
[00:46:31] there's like a little and I can write the notes to them
[00:46:34] so each like January be a different note for me
[00:46:37] like so you know each month for that first year
[00:46:40] they're hearing for me
[00:46:42] yeah no I love that
[00:46:44] I also just because this was it's pulled back the curtain
[00:46:48] a little bit about how we book our show
[00:46:51] we send questions to our guests
[00:46:53] and I never ever get to the questions
[00:46:56] but there was one that one response that you gave
[00:46:59] that I just thought was so cute
[00:47:01] and I really wanted to share this story
[00:47:05] this year that you were named the mayor by a client
[00:47:09] so I don't want to give away the punch line
[00:47:13] but do you mind sharing the story
[00:47:14] because this is such a great holiday story
[00:47:18] well it's just so you know to be the mayor of something
[00:47:22] right you should be actually really quite charming
[00:47:25] and when a client either says that you're like the mayor
[00:47:28] it's like oh it should be really really flattering
[00:47:32] but this was a client that
[00:47:36] definitely we had identified the Upper East Side
[00:47:40] which I know like the back of my hand
[00:47:42] know really really really well
[00:47:43] but he's like you're the mayor of Nofu
[00:47:46] and I'm like mayor of Nofu
[00:47:49] like what is Nofu and he's like
[00:47:52] it's the Upper East Side Leslie
[00:47:54] you're the mayor of Nofu and I'm like what is Nofu
[00:47:58] and he said Nofu and I'm like oh my god
[00:48:01] so you're the mayor of the Nofu part of New York
[00:48:05] and again it wasn't because I'm not Nofu but he was like
[00:48:09] nervous that the Upper East Side had this reputation
[00:48:12] of not being fun and that people always went downtown
[00:48:16] to have fun so yes I was named the mayor of Nofu
[00:48:23] and I'm such a kick out that is that is that is amazing
[00:48:31] so curious how you've seen like for 20 so by the time this will be released
[00:48:37] it'll be in January we're actually recording it here in December
[00:48:42] 2023 you know you've been you've been through several market cycles
[00:48:46] you were you went through the the crash of 08
[00:48:51] and just 2023 do you have any fear about 2023 how are you how are you approaching
[00:48:57] the new I mean not only have I been through the crash right but the pandemic
[00:49:04] yes you know like and I did not leave the city I was here for my clients I did not leave
[00:49:11] and I had clients who would call me during the pandemic and they say what is happening on West
[00:49:16] 79th Street and I'm like you know what let me go over there and I'm going
[00:49:21] running over because Lucerne had given over their hotel to them whatever but
[00:49:26] you know news news media can make things sound that much worse and so
[00:49:33] boots on the ground but anyway um point being I've been through so many
[00:49:39] different cycles that I think you really need to just be confident that
[00:49:45] people do need to move right there are always going to be circumstances and you need to figure out
[00:49:53] in any given market what the advantage is so we had low interest rates and there was a time
[00:50:00] a minute moment where the market kind of dropped right but only like 8 to 10 percent even during
[00:50:06] the pandemic but if you had the guts to buy then you know that was a brilliant time so 2023
[00:50:14] we're kind of looking at a first half of year potentially being difficult maybe a couple more
[00:50:20] price increases but I think you know interest rate increases but I think people have already
[00:50:26] experienced that and have the knowledge and we're looking at a really strong second half of year
[00:50:31] that's my prediction so if you can work with your clients at a time when the first half of
[00:50:38] the year people are nervous there are opportunities so that's a great time to negotiate
[00:50:45] um and there's a great saying date the rate marry the home so if someone is you know nervous
[00:50:54] about interest rates you can change your interest rate later but if you find that home you love
[00:50:59] and you need to finance just know that that's a possibility so um I think you know you just
[00:51:07] it has to be business as usual you have to know your market you have to know your comms
[00:51:13] and think about the opportunities because you may in the first half of the year
[00:51:20] like find that there are people that are still a little bit nervous and willing to negotiate a bit more
[00:51:26] so yeah there there is negotiation it happens now it didn't uh didn't happen
[00:51:32] no I mean there was you know just a year ago or whatever you could walk around the block and
[00:51:39] you had to make a decision right so do you have any buyers that are feeling remorse um
[00:51:48] that oh gosh when interest rates were at 3% I should have pulled the trigger
[00:51:53] um do you have to counsel people through that you know um because again um yes and
[00:52:00] rates prices were also super inflated you were competing against many other buyers
[00:52:06] and you were going to probably pay more um so I'm just curious on uh yes so now that's where
[00:52:12] that's where you kind of have to you know help them understand uh that guess you know you're
[00:52:18] getting that property at you know a better value so yes you may be paying more in your monthly
[00:52:25] for your mortgage but that same property a year ago you wouldn't be able to negotiate on so
[00:52:33] there's always and and that is why kind of the date the rate is also gives people confidence that
[00:52:40] you know what maybe I can change it later but historically we are still at really low interest rates
[00:52:47] I know like really really low and yes really really low really really low let's not freak out everybody
[00:52:55] um we're not in double digits we're not you know exactly and um the other thing is New York you know
[00:53:03] not for everyone but we're a very cash-driven city so we have a lot of cash deals that have always
[00:53:10] happened that will continue to happen bonuses may not be as strong as other years but bonuses get
[00:53:17] paid so you know you have to look at Manhattan look at the concrete things that happen um and our
[00:53:25] market continues like I'm not I'm not concerned good well that I that is very reassuring to our
[00:53:34] audience and to me as well because I have not been in it for 18 years um and haven't weathered all
[00:53:41] of the the cycles and storms that you have but I'm glad to hear that you are not particularly

And now onto the main event, my conversation with Leslie Singer. Hey, today on the show, we have Leslie Singer, with the singer team with Brown Harris Stevens in New York City. Let me tell you more about Leslie. Now, Leslie is an award-winning broker and has consistently been one of Brown Harris Stevens' top performers leading a team that has repeatedly been number one in sales for the firm. She has also earned a reputation as one of the most approachable and loyal representatives in the industry. Leslie's track record of success is a function of her exceptional negotiation skills, tailored marketing solutions, and an innate ability to help clients navigate the complex New York real estate market. Her honors include winning the real estate board of New York Deal of the Year award, also being acknowledged as one of the top women in real estate by New York real estate journal, and being recognized as one of the top real estate teams nationwide by the Wall Street Journal. Born in bread in New York City, Leslie's informed, sophisticated sensibilities and her MBA background guide the team in preparing for transitions and transactions, discerning value and return on investment. Now, I want everybody to open up Instagram and TikTok and I want you to follow Leslie and her team. It's the same user name for both. It is singer, team, NYC, that's S-I-N-G-E-R. So singer, team, NYC, both Instagram and TikTok, and we will have a link to those in our show notes. You can click on those and follow because Leslie is doing some really, really cool stuff and her team on social, especially on TikTok, which she just got into, which we can talk about too. Anyway, Leslie, welcome to the show. Oh my God, thank you for having me, but now I, all of a sudden, I got nervous because there's accolades. I mean, now I've delivered to them. That's true. There's a lot of pressure to deliver. You know what, I'm going to say this at the beginning because since I just, you know, really, I'm so impressed with what you've done and I usually leave this to the end and then I realize not everybody makes it to the end. So before we actually start the interview, I mean, it's funny I've been doing this five years. You think it would have occurred to me sooner, but I guess better late, better late than ever. But if you are an agent in New York City and you are shopping around for maybe a new team, a new firm, maybe you think you could be a good asset to Leslie and her team, reach out to them and let's talk, have a conversation and maybe you could be a possible good fit for the singer team. So anyway, just wanted to throw that out there first. Except now they need to listen to see if they actually want to do that. Oh, they're going to want to work with you. I assure you, you are a big, big, big deal. And that's the other thing too is definitely, you know, that's why we're so excited to have you on the show. But let's, I would love to start. So what I don't really know is how you got started because I know you have this big success now. But everyone starts somewhere and I would love to hear about how and why you got into real estate. So I'll try and make it a shorter story than, but it was actually really interesting. My background is marketing. And I was the vice president of marketing for American movie classics. I had the dream job, truly a dream job. But I was flying all over the place and I ended up with these two little kids that like immediately, they're 17 months apart. And I couldn't be flying around the world and having two little little ones at home. So I really, really, really strategized about what my next steps were. And it was really hard to come to this decision. But I was like, huh, I have a marketing background, very, very strong marketing background. I have an MBA so I can do board packages and I love finances. And I grew up in Manhattan. I know it like the back of my hand. And if I were to go into real estate, I wouldn't be traveling. So I took the MBA and I took the marketing background, my knowledge in Manhattan and triangulated on real estate. So it was a very thoughtful and strategic decision for anyone that's starting out. And so that's how I came into the idea of real estate. And it was really truly for those reasons. And for anyone who's starting in real estate, I talked to a lot of firms when I was thinking about, starting my career and every firm has a very different corporate culture and a very different way of proceeding. And so it was really fascinating. And not only does each firm have a different corporate culture, but even within the firm, certain offices, within the same firm even have a different corporate culture. So I interviewed with a lot of different firms and the other thing I will say is having a mentor when you start is really, really, really important. So I met with someone at Brown Harris Stevens. I met with a manager, again, interviewed with a lot of different firms, but came upon some manager at Brown Harris Stevens who said, huh, I got a call. It was someone who was looking for an assistant who would bring me on and we would kind of did a handshake, but certain arrangements were made that I would cover all weekends, open houses, just to start and get the mentoring. And we said we would try it for six months. And six months turned into 18 years on a handshake. And everything was just above board. And it was, again, for me to learn, but within six months, it kind of became more of a partnership. And I really brought my marketing background to the whole process and marketed ourselves, branded ourselves. And it was great. So. Well, before I go into sort of how you got started and with that, because I think in particular, that marketing background is so incredibly useful for agents when they get, well, at any point in their career, but certainly when they get started, I was going to say with AMC, I'm going back to American Movie Classics. I always worship the, that the lists, I'm thinking of American Film Institute. Okay, American Film Classics is different. Sorry, I'm thinking of AFI who puts those lists together. So sorry, I was getting confused. But yeah, American Film Classics, yeah, big, you were AMC, I'm sorry, AMC. Yes, but yeah, I'm a big, God, I love American Movie Classics as well. The brand that they've built is impressive. But so. I mean, I was at Time Warner, I was at an ad agency. I mean, I really, I just, I loved what he did, but I have to say I'm equally passionate that I get to do, and it's a privilege to get to do what I do every day. And I imagine you get to sort of scratch the creative itch as well because with you get to be in full control of your branding, your marketing, your, your messaging. So does that sort of satisfy the part of you that loves being creative and? Oh, that, but I also have to say every deal and no two deals are alike, and you have to be creative in this industry and think outside the box, A, if you're promoting a property, how to differentiate, but also when it comes to a board package and someone's financials, and I'm not saying you have to be creative with their financials, but every deal has some sort of creative component of how to make the candidate the strongest possible presentation, et cetera. So I get creativity, and there's a lot of creativity in how I handle my clients, but we can, we can get into that too now or we can get into it later. Yeah, let's jump into it now. I'd love to hear about sort of how you approach clients. Well, first, actually, no, let's back up. I want to first find out about attracting clients because even though you've been doing this for a long time now in a really impressive career, everyone gets started with really no clients. And so I'm curious, how did you, when you first started 18 years ago, what were your strategies? I imagine you had some sort of fear of influence because you live, but New York is so transient that I don't know how much that helps, but you did grow up there. So I'm curious. Yeah, so I mean, interestingly enough, when you're first starting out, and yes, it was really important that I had a strong mentor behind me, which could show that there was someone with extreme knowledge and attract record as well, and then honestly, the Brown-Harris Stevens brand. So those are definitely great things to have in my back pocket, but you don't always want or nor do your friends want to work with a newbie, right? Oh, and they're buying a million dollar home. Oh, my friend just got a license a week ago. Exactly. And nor do they always want to show their finances to you, right? That's, you know, it is, I'm sorry to interrupt, but it is such, it is, that is something that nobody really has ever, we've done 430 episodes, and just that little piece that you said about, I've had lots of guests say, well, I didn't want to work with my friends because I was afraid I would screw things up or I was afraid to ask for their business. But the one thing I never thought about was what you just said, which is, I don't know what my friends earn. I don't. I've never asked them. I was taught not to ask. Right. And I was taught that any discussion of that was either considered braggadocia or being rude. So, yes, so that's really interesting. So that's a really strong point. So you add these people, but maybe you didn't feel so comfortable asking for business. Yeah, no, I mean, absolutely. And look, and again, being that I had someone in my, you know, like as almost a partnership in the beginning, I could offer that should they want to work with me, not only did they have the knowledge behind and the security of that, but that he could review their finances, but even that, like, felt, it just, you know, I understand their hesitation. But what I did do is in my little sphere of influence was I actually started like the old-fashioned way and I kind of went to 10 of my really, really good friends. And I asked each of them for 10 names of people that I could contact, just to start my own database. So, you know, that's only 100 people, but then those 10 people. So almost like, you know, those, what are they? Like male chain things that used to get. So that was one thing I did. And I started a newsletter, which was something that my mentor had been doing. But there was always a column that was singer says and it kind of talked about like the New York school system or, you know, those type of things that were New York-based, truly New York that showed that you had an insider- like, you know, influence on Manhattan. And we would mail the building's newsletters. And so, oh, that's interesting. So you would just blank it, man. Blanket, blanket, yeah. The part of my working at Time Warner was direct marketing. So I was like, let's do direct marketing. Let's do a newsletter. Let's, you know, and people held onto those newsletters. It was pretty great. So that was one of a couple of the things. Trying to take care of that. Can I pause you for a minute? I'm gonna tell you something that's gonna, that's not gonna surprise you, but also surprise you at the same time. Because, well, so I moved into a new development year and a half ago. And it's a nice building. There's 40 units, a town home. There's a few town homes. There's, but it's a nice building. And brand new development. Now, obviously, all of us who have purchased, probably not leaving any immediate time soon, but in a year and a half. So we're talking about sending out mailers, trying to establish your brand. At some point, all of us are probably gonna move. It's at some point, it's, it's, it's, it would be unlikely that our building people would live there for 40 or 50 years, although they could, but it's unlikely. So because of the neighborhood that we're in, and it's just one of those younger neighborhoods. Not one piece of mail from any REALTOR just saying, hey, you know, like obviously that would be a long-term play. They're probably like, well, if I'm gonna start mailing, I'm gonna be needing a mail for the next five to seven years. But why not? And what's amazing is not one piece of mail from any REALTOR in the last year and a half. And I don't think it's because people know that I'm in the business. I just think nobody's thought to do this. So I think even that's kind of a lost art these days, and there's so much opportunity. So I just wanted to mention that. I think people are cutting back on mailing, right? Cause we have social media, we have everything else, but it is a really great way to cut through the clutter. And when I do a new listing, I'm mail the neighborhood. And I mail the building as well, because people who love your building, like you, you may not be ready to sell, but you may know someone who wants to buy there. Because you love the building and they come to visit you. Yeah, of course. So like it's just another way to keep yourself top of mind. You also said something else, and I apologize for like interrupting you every few moments. You said something that at first I sort of was like, I didn't understand it. And then as you were talking, it made sense. And this is such a, this is, no, no, this is a thing nobody else has said either, which was, so there used to be this old sales technique at the closing table or whether you're selling a car or a house or whatever, the old salesman 101 was like, by the way, I'd like the name of three of your friends. Now, that, and nobody likes that, right? We all are like, yeah, but what you did was much smarter and definitely works and it isn't uncomfortable, which is you go to your friends and you say, hey, I'm starting my business. I'm not obviously, you know, if you know someone who wants to buy yourself, obviously I'd love to talk to him, but I would just love to get introduced to some of your friends. And basically that's what you were asking. And that's just called networking. And I just want to make, I just want to make sure that anyone listening, that is a really smart strategy because your friends are the ones that want you to succeed. And you're not asking them to like, you know, you're not really asking them for much. You're not asking for a sale, you're not asking them for it. Now, no, no, it's just like, who do you think would be really good for me to reach out to and talk to you for milk? It's brilliant. It's brilliant. And I know if somebody asked me, I mean, it's such a simple thing, but no, really people don't do this very often, I don't think. If somebody, if one of my friends were to say, I'm starting this XYZ business, whatever it is, hey, could you give me some names of people that might in the future maybe be a candidate for me? I just want to put them on my list or reach out. I wouldn't hesitate. I'd be like, of course I will. Like, no big deal. Yeah, no one is asking a client at the closing table. That one feels more uncomfortable than this. It is. It's a definitely. I agree. I just wanted to honor you for a couple of those, those really, though, it's always the small things, right? Like people say things on the show and all of a sudden, like they just kind of go past it because they don't realize how important I think that is. And I'll be like, oh, stop, stop. You just, so you've done that a several times. So I promise to not interrupt as much anymore. No, no, I appreciate that. The other thing was I noticed this happened when my, when my children were in nursery school, and we were implying for kindergarten, a lot of my, the parents would talk to me because I grew up in Manhattan about the different schools. And I only went to one or two of them, right? But they would ask me, and I had a general knowledge of the school system. And I was like, huh, why don't I give back? And this is in my first year of real estate. Why don't I give back to the community and by hosting seminars about the school system? And so we would, I would have a getting into kindergarten school panel and a getting into nursery school, which is a huge thing in Manhattan. I would have these panel discussions and I would bring in not only parents, but guidance counselors. And yes, they have them for nursery school. Yes, they have them for kindergarten. But it was my way to give back to the community with also the self-serving idea that these people will be making a decision shortly once they know where their child is getting into school as to where they want to live. So then. I love that. And here in Chicago, I don't know if, you know, I'm not a parent myself, so I don't know if those exist. I have not, I've heard of REALTORS doing, so you want to buy a condo, so you want to buy a first home. Those seminars happen, those are pretty common. I've not heard about school and that is every new parents sort of big, one of their biggest issues is where, especially in a big city, where is my child going to go to school, where the safe areas, what are the best, academics, et cetera. That's real smart. Now I do it through college, because that's kind of as my kids got older and I had more knowledge and we still, we do college seminars as well. Wow. And I have to say it's fun for me. It shows how old I am, but there are clients that I helped with the nursery that I've also helped with the college. I mean, it's. Isn't that incredible? Yeah, all the way through. Yeah. Well, my sister and I both went to Miami University out in Ohio, Miami of Ohio, and then my sister ended up in New York City. They actually have a pretty strong alumni, contingency there in New York, which is surprising whenever I met people in Ohio that went to Miami, that were from New York. I was like, how did you find out about this, really, we should be in Florida, we're in a middle of Ohio. And yeah, but anyway, that's, that is amazing. So you still do those. You still do, you're just, and you go all the way, you still do all the way from nursery school up through college. You know, we've really, we've been really focused more on the college because again, it's a life cycle and it's a really nice way to give back and eventually people will think about, you know, my home is larger than I need, right? As their kids go off to college. So, well, just even, just even planning for college with 529 plans and the financial part of it is, is so daunting and so scary for new parents, that it's something that they have to start thinking about pretty much right away. Yeah. Yeah, in utero, it's, yeah, I, I, yes, my, my one nephew is five. And so he's got some time, but my, my sister's all, they've already figured it all out. It's already all figured out and I was like, good for them. Yeah. Yeah. But so, so that, that is a really smart strategy because again, you are giving back, you're contributing, you're providing value. And then, oh, and oh, by the way, I'm also a REALTOR. So, well, and, you know, and my, my, finding the perfect fit for school is very similar to finding a perfect fit for your family and a building. And the application process of a applying for these schools is not that different. Of course, you're not showing all your financials, but you still have an application process for getting into a school. You have an application process for, you know, a co-op. So, there were so many similarities, but again, and it wasn't, it was a nice way for me to give back with a minor ask, right? So, it felt good. And so you bring in, you said you bring in guidance counselors. Do you ever bring in representatives from the schools themselves? I have done that and I've done parents. So you have a really, really nice range of people. That is such a great idea. I love that. So, wow. I think it's really important. And I think it's really important to really think about what's authentic and genuine to you with whatever you do, because people will, they can feel it, they can sense it. And it's really where you're coming from the most honest place. And I think it's great for connecting. So I would say to anyone starting out, think about what's really authentic and genuine to you and follow that. So, that was, that was her places for me. That felt really good. Yeah, it makes all the sense in the world. I also want to go back to this idea of open houses, because I feel like that too is so easily like, yeah, yeah, yeah, sit open houses, but it's not, maybe it doesn't sound very exciting to talk about, but I would say that almost every guest I've had on it, I only really interview top 1% producers. They all love, and they all started doing open houses for other agents and learning how to talk to clients as they walk in and out, how to, you know, understanding how to have conversations about real estate, how to talk to clients, understanding their needs, how important was it for you to do a lot of those reps, sort of going to the gym almost of open houses, how critical is that for you? So for me, those weekend open houses, where I took over our listings and had the open houses, those were really, really, really critical. And I will tell anyone, even if you are representing a property, you should have and know inside and out all the other competitive properties, because when you get someone at that open house and you say to them, because it's a really critical question, does this work for you? And they're like, nah, you know what, this or that, and then you can say, this may not work for you, but how about this? I think you should look at this. May I make an appointment for you? So know your competition and turn that person, if they're not, they're not gonna be the buyer for your property, turn them into a buyer for another property. It's a art and it's a great opportunity. So yes, those open houses were really, really, really important. The other thing is when other brokers are holding open houses, go to as many open houses as possible and learn the market, whether it's a one bedroom, a studio, a two bedroom, a five bedroom, because inevitably you'll be at a cocktail party and you'll be, oh, you know, oh, you're interested on the upper East Side, I saw this great two bedroom the other day, right? Like, it's just get to know the market and it doesn't matter. I mean, I've been doing this so many years and I still go to open houses so I can see what's out there. So, and also too, it's great. I don't love the word networking because I just feel like that I don't even know it and always what that means. But this idea of going to these broker open houses allows you to interact with other REALTORS. And there's a real practical reason to do this, even other than just being front and friendly and nice. And then you learn the market and you learn the market. You learn the market. You know, when I'm talking to other brokers and I'm going to the open house, inevitably there's a discussion of like, you know, what are you seeing? You know, how, you know, how are you finding the market? This is what I'm experiencing. And there's also the great discussion of, hey, I'm bringing this on. Do you know anyone or, you know, I, someone doesn't want to list this, but they're thinking about listing it. Would you have any? Well, I mean, there are so many dialogues that are important. Plus just have your face out there, of course. Well, and I imagine too, like during the pandemic, for example, when, well, once, once the sort of pandemic was subsiding and people, you know, the interest rates were so low and everyone was trying to buy, I imagine it doesn't hurt going to an open house, you know, at some point introducing yourself to the other agent, making nice with them, developing some sort of friendship or relationship, professional friendship with them. Probably doesn't hurt then when they see out of the 30 offers they just received, when they see a friendly, a name that they recognize. And like, I know this, this woman, she's awesome. I met her at an open house. She seems great. It probably doesn't hurt at getting a little bit more attention on that, on the offer. Now you're absolutely right about that. I'm working on a transaction right now and the offer was accepted, honestly, probably a good six to eight weeks ago, of which we still haven't gone to contract. And I represent the purchaser and the broker on the other side is like, thank God it's you. Thank God it's you. I know we're gonna get there. Yeah, because of you. And she said, you know, never in my 40 years have I experienced this, but like, you know, so to your point, making contact, making connections, just as someone, when it deal comes together, they have a name and a face and they feel good about it is really truly important. I'm curious too, because you've been in this industry almost 20 years, you've seen a lot of agents come and go, you've seen as you've been building your business and your team, what are some of the mistakes that you see agents making as they are trying to build their business? Or, and there's so many mistakes that agents make. But what we try to do on the show is help agents avoid some of those pitfalls. So is there anything that comes to mind? I mean, aside from like not working hard enough, yes, that's usually the main reason I find that people tend to exit the industry, but it isn't always that. And sometimes people just make, you know, decisions that they could have made differently. So is there anything that you sort of see agents any mistakes that agents make that really they, that could be avoided, anything that comes to mind? God, I have to think about this for a second, mistakes. I think sometimes when you're young and you're hungry, you want the deal more than you, like you know, you want it too much and you lose sight of your client and you push for a deal and I think a lot gets lost there and your relationships are so important that you can't want the deal more than your own client. And, you know, deals are gonna come and go and they're gonna come together or they're gonna fall apart or whatever, but making sure that your client feels really attended to throughout. So really spending that time and not thinking of it is just like a one deal and then you're onto the next because you build your business by clients referring to you are coming back to you and don't make something like a one trick pony. Yeah. So that's really, really good advice. And I'm curious to with the amount of time and the number of deals that you have done, how important is it to anticipate your client's needs or their mental state? And I don't mean, you know, whether they're sane or insane, I mean, they're anxiety, they're fears, they're joy that how critical is it to be able to manage those expectations and those emotions for your clients? Because I know every time I've purchased a sold property, something always goes wrong, there's always a moment where I'm like, well, something's gonna, this is all falling apart, this is all going to be a big disaster and then, you know, it isn't, but the stress of that is real. And I'm curious about how you help your clients through those difficult, you know, moments of a transaction. Well, so there's, I mean, you bring up a really, really important point, which is a, every deal has a moment, every single, every single deal has a moment. Like there's, you know, and you never know when it's gonna happen, but it's kind of like when it happens, like, here it is, and you work through it. I try to, the best of my ability to always handle all those moments without including my client. So I try, I take on the stress and try and navigate to get to the right answer without having to stress them out and only go to them at those really critical moments that I'm like, I can't do it without, you know, including them, but I do think you spend time with the client upfront and, you know, just in your dialogue of getting to know them of, is this a life transition, right? So you come into people's lives, whether they're having, getting married, having a baby, you know, it's their first time purchase, some are getting divorced, sometimes it's death, sometimes it's in a state sale and getting to know what their objectives are, but where they are in their life cycle and understanding that will help you navigate with them and listening throughout the entire process. You'll get to a sense whether this is someone who makes a really quick decision, this is someone who needs more handholding, this is someone who needs to see 25 properties, they only need to see five, you know. So it's a lot of listening and there's a lot of handholding and there are times when you're a therapist, right? Because you're dealing with someone's largest asset, they've exposed everything, you know, they've told their life story in a board package, they've shown all their financials, they're extremely anxious, they started envisioning themselves in the property, you know, and for whatever their reason is for their transition, that comes to play. So, and they're for sellers, that's a really emotional time. They may have brought up their whole family there and they're selling because they don't need that family how many more, but it's still emotional, even if they're excited about where they're going, it's still emotional or, you know, if it's a death or whatever divorce. So yes, a transition's in getting to know your client, but I really, there are a couple of things I do, which is I try and understand that client really well in the beginning and I listen, but I really respect someone's time. So I try, if I'm working with a buyer, I try and identify before we even go out, five to 10 properties that I think are going to be a perfect fit. I line those five properties up in a row, get a car and driver. So I only take them out of their day to day for maybe an hour and have to two hours. And then we can kind of have a conversation after that, like what worked, what didn't work, and then I can refine the search that much more, but I'm always sensitive to someone's time. Can I ask about doing showings? This is such a simple question. Everybody does them differently. Do you visit the properties before your client? I love previewing. I love to preview a property. A, it allows me to eliminate if I don't think it's going to be appropriate, but B, when I get to that property, and I think it is the right fit because I've previewed it, it not only gives me ability to be comfortable in the show, but I have a lot of knowledge and I can point out to my client, and the things that I know are important priorities for them. So whether it's closet space or whatever it may be, I know that that's important to them and I can help highlight it. So I love previewing. So whatever possible preview? In my opinion, yes, it takes extra time, but it's so worth it. And that property that you see that your previewing may not be right for the client you had in mind, but I promise you somewhere in the next kind of like discussions you're having, all of a sudden, and it could be three weeks later, and that property hopefully still on the market, you're like, oh my God, the property that I saw for so and so, that wasn't right is totally right for someone else. There's no waste of time. It worked. I guess what we're really talking about is learning the inventory. I mean, as simple as it sounds, and inventories, of course, always changing, but this idea of being a master of the inventory is really so critical. It's not, hey, I'm gonna go on this journey with you and we're gonna walk into this home together and check it out. It's, I'm gonna go on the journey first. I'm gonna check everything out so that I can bring back. And it's a simple thing, but I don't know that most agents even preview properties. I think they, a lot of them show up with their client. And, you know, and that is, that's really not the, it gets just my opinion, but it's not really the best client experience that way, I believe. Yeah, I think, you know, I think, look, everybody has a different, a different way of handling their business. Again, it gives me the confidence walking in that I feel like it is really right. I can show it better even though I'm not the shower, the listing agent might be the shower, but again, it's just, as you said, getting to know the inventory is just so critical. I wanna, I wanna go ahead, I'm sorry. No, no, no, just recently there was a home that I had previewed. I thought it was absolutely like the perfect fit, brought the couple, the wife looks at me and she's like, oh my God, I love this, I love this. But there was something in the husband's face that I was like, mm-hmm. And I came back to work a couple of days later and I said, look, you know, I sent you this listing and you said you weren't interested in seeing it for the following reasons, but I noticed your husband's reaction and I actually think this will appeal to him more and she's like, huh, okay, let's go. And that's the one they bought. Yeah. So it's like just, you know, you have to also be present when you're showing at the show. You have to pay attention. And it's actually, and so in that probably being that the physical space isn't new to you at that moment because you've already previewed it, you now can focus your attention on their reaction versus what's actually going around visually. I can really be in the comment. Exactly. That is an important tip. And so maybe that's even the best reason of all to preview. Is well, there's lots of crit reasons. Learn the property. It allows you to really be watching the content. Yeah. You know, you're so right because I know for me any shiny object, you know, captures by attention. And so if I'm walking in somewhere for the first time I'm looking around and seeing everything visually. And of course, that's what the client is going to be doing and you're really watching them what instead of, you know, being taken in yourself by everything. And that is, again, it's a simple thing but not every REALTOR thinks about that. And that is really, we're talking about professionalism, I think, and being professional. And that is such a great idea. So thank you for that. And another question, I want to just switch gears a little bit because you were telling me just before we got on, Leslie and I were talking about, I am so jealous because I live in Chicago and we are the second city. And New York is probably the first city. And so I live in a very wonderful place but I'm so jealous because New York is such a lovely place. And we were talking about all things New York.

But you were telling me that you just recently had some success on social media with TikTok and you know this is really interesting because I've been doing the show for five years and no one's talked TikTok yet. And I'm not asking you to to give away any secrets or any but we are starting to see REALTORS now embrace TikTok which is being used of course by you know the demographic of TikTok users are excused younger. And so I'm curious on what you're doing there and what sort of results you're seeing because you just had a big success there. Yeah. So I've been doing Instagram you know obviously for quite a while now and I have a team that helps and supports me and I kept saying think we really need to be on TikTok. Think we really need to be on TikTok and they're like yeah you know it's new. And I'm like so I'm maybe even be late to the game because I keep I was harping on this but we really only started a couple of weeks ago. And again I'm doing things that are truly, truly genuine to me and really comfortable for me usually around the prop it's around properties. Although as I mentioned to you I just happened to do one around hot chocolate because I do like to bring in a little bit of lifestyle and like things that are popping up in Manhattan that could be useful to bits but they're usually centered around a property that I'm promoting and just having a ton of fun with it but like you know again it's really really new to me and this one particular video went viral and we have like now 270,000 hits on it and I'm like okay so and I'll just share with you that my son who's 25 he's like hey mom my friends are loving you on TikTok and they say so you're so professional. Hey mom I didn't even know you were on TikTok and he goes I don't have TikTok. I'm so excited. Hey mom stay out of my friends TikToks. But I wasn't there blocked or they're following me it wasn't like you know. But isn't that amazing if you put out good quality content or fun content entertaining content whatever it might be it can you know we do have a ways you know we do have the opportunity now with technology where things can spread and it's all about value and so I imagine TikTok is as well as Instagram is fun for you because with your marketing background you get to really project what I am I'm curious to about how you stay in touch with clients in between their sales right so somebody buys a co-op there maybe they're gonna live there for X number of years how are you staying in touch with them in between? Yeah so then that's always a really hard thing because you're really really busy with your day to day so I do do a monthly newsletter and sometimes it's not you know as frequent sometimes it's more frequent if it's important but I definitely do a monthly newsletter. I really love my clients like I really really love my clients so fortunately that means having coffee with them having a lunch you know having a drink and it may not be as you know sometimes you can do it more frequently everyone schedules really really busy but your clients sometimes become your really good friends sometimes you know as I said summer with me forever and repeat business and then it's little things like just reaching out and following up you know how are you enjoying your apartment love to see it love to drop by you know and then I do every now and then I don't do holiday gifts because they get lost in the clutter but I will pick a different time of year to do a gift and do a mailing of a gift so and it could be you know years we've did champagne it's just another way of just saying you know thinking of you and usually for the first year when someone buys from me they'll get like wine of the month so each month or depending on who they are maybe it's flowers each month so each month there's like a little and I can write the notes to them so each like January be a different note for me like so you know each month for that first year they're hearing for me yeah no I love that I also just because this was it's pulled back the curtain a little bit about how we book our show we send questions to our guests and I never ever get to the questions but there was one that one response that you gave that I just thought was so cute and I really wanted to share this story this year that you were named the mayor by a client so I don't want to give away the punch line but do you mind sharing the story because this is such a great holiday story well it's just so you know to be the mayor of something right you should be actually really quite charming and when a client either says that you're like the mayor it's like oh it should be really really flattering but this was a client that definitely we had identified the Upper East Side which I know like the back of my hand know really really really well but he's like you're the mayor of Nofu and I'm like mayor of Nofu like what is Nofu and he's like it's the Upper East Side Leslie you're the mayor of Nofu and I'm like what is Nofu and he said Nofu and I'm like oh my god so you're the mayor of the Nofu part of New York and again it wasn't because I'm not Nofu but he was like nervous that the Upper East Side had this reputation of not being fun and that people always went downtown to have fun so yes I was named the mayor of Nofu and I'm such a kick out that is that is that is amazing so curious how you've seen like for 20 so by the time this will be released it'll be in January we're actually recording it here in December 2023 you know you've been you've been through several market cycles you were you went through the the crash of 08 and just 2023 do you have any fear about 2023 how are you how are you approaching the new I mean not only have I been through the crash right but the pandemic yes you know like and I did not leave the city I was here for my clients I did not leave and I had clients who would call me during the pandemic and they say what is happening on West 79th Street and I'm like you know what let me go over there and I'm going running over because Lucerne had given over their hotel to them whatever but you know news news media can make things sound that much worse and so boots on the ground but anyway um point being I've been through so many different cycles that I think you really need to just be confident that people do need to move right there are always going to be circumstances and you need to figure out in any given market what the advantage is so we had low interest rates and there was a time a minute moment where the market kind of dropped right but only like 8 to 10 percent even during the pandemic but if you had the guts to buy then you know that was a brilliant time so 2023 we're kind of looking at a first half of year potentially being difficult maybe a couple more price increases but I think you know interest rate increases but I think people have already experienced that and have the knowledge and we're looking at a really strong second half of year that's my prediction so if you can work with your clients at a time when the first half of the year people are nervous there are opportunities so that's a great time to negotiate um and there's a great saying date the rate marry the home so if someone is you know nervous about interest rates you can change your interest rate later but if you find that home you love and you need to finance just know that that's a possibility so um I think you know you just it has to be business as usual you have to know your market you have to know your comms and think about the opportunities because you may in the first half of the year like find that there are people that are still a little bit nervous and willing to negotiate a bit more so yeah there there is negotiation it happens now it didn't uh didn't happen no I mean there was you know just a year ago or whatever you could walk around the block and you had to make a decision right so do you have any buyers that are feeling remorse um that oh gosh when interest rates were at 3% I should have pulled the trigger um do you have to counsel people through that you know um because again um yes and rates prices were also super inflated you were competing against many other buyers and you were going to probably pay more um so I'm just curious on uh yes so now that's where that's where you kind of have to you know help them understand uh that guess you know you're getting that property at you know a better value so yes you may be paying more in your monthly for your mortgage but that same property a year ago you wouldn't be able to negotiate on so there's always and and that is why kind of the date the rate is also gives people confidence that you know what maybe I can change it later but historically we are still at really low interest rates I know like really really low and yes really really low really really low let's not freak out everybody um we're not in double digits we're not you know exactly and um the other thing is New York you know not for everyone but we're a very cash-driven city so we have a lot of cash deals that have always happened that will continue to happen bonuses may not be as strong as other years but bonuses get paid so you know you have to look at Manhattan look at the concrete things that happen um and our market continues like I'm not I'm not concerned good well that I that is very reassuring to our audience and to me as well because I have not been in it for 18 years um and haven't weathered all of the the cycles and storms that you have but I'm glad to hear that you are not particularly worried about 2023 and that that will help calm there's too much discussion about recession at first half and then pulling out really fast so in a V going right back yeah well we certainly hope hope for the best um Leslie I am so happy that you spent time with us today you are a real treasure and for anyone out there who is an agent who either has clients who move to New York City who would want to refer business to it maybe you don't practice in New York Leslie would love the opportunity to connect with you um of course many people have you know properties in the New York
