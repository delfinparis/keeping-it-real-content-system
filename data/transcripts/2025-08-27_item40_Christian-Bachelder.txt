[00:01:14] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:18] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team?
[00:01:21] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:23] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:26] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:29] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:31] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:33] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:36] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:39] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:42] and which agents at your own firm
[00:01:45] are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:47] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:49] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:52] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:54] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:56] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:01:59] for each agent in your market
[00:02:01] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:04] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went
[00:02:07] and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:09] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:11] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me
[00:02:14] exactly what to say based on that agent's needs
[00:02:17] and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:19] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:21] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:22] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:25] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,

[00:02:39] So.
[00:02:52] Welcome to Keeping It Real,
[00:02:54] the largest podcast made by real estate agents
[00:02:56] and for real estate agents.
[00:02:58] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:02:59] I'm your guide and host through the show
[00:03:01] and today is our monthly series,
[00:03:03] Learn with a Lender with a legend
[00:03:06] in the lending space Christian Batchelder.
[00:03:09] Let me tell you more about Christian.
[00:03:10] He together with David Green, Christian co-founded
[00:03:13] the one brokerage,
[00:03:14] deemed the fastest growing broker in the nation in 2021
[00:03:17] and 2022 ranked in the top 20 brokerages
[00:03:20] by funded loan volume.
[00:03:22] Christians at UC Berkeley grad.
[00:03:24] He has a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering
[00:03:26] but hated the industry and wanted to get out
[00:03:28] of caped earning potential.
[00:03:30] Got into real estate with the help of a childhood family
[00:03:32] friend who had some success in the business
[00:03:34] and discovered he had a knack for connecting with people
[00:03:37] and adding value to their mindsets, investments,
[00:03:39] and journeys.
[00:03:40] He's a licensed real estate, insurance and mortgage broker.
[00:03:43] Christian regularly hosts mastermind seminars
[00:03:46] and webinars with real estate gurus.
[00:03:47] He teaches people everything from investing principles
[00:03:50] to how and how to buy your 1000th property
[00:03:53] with a focus on what markets to target,
[00:03:55] how to find the best loan and how to protect
[00:03:57] one's investments with insurance policies
[00:03:59] and other forms of asset protection.
[00:04:00] He has purchased 15 properties himself in the last 12 months
[00:04:05] and has an amazing strategy for all of us
[00:04:07] to consider doing a similar thing, maybe not that many properties
[00:04:11] in a year, but certainly buying investment properties.
[00:04:13] There's a lot of our listeners that have not taken the plunge
[00:04:16] there or they just want to learn to work with investors.
[00:04:18] Christian is kind of an expert in all things investments
[00:04:21] but he's going to talk about these same principles
[00:04:24] that he teaches, he does himself.
[00:04:26] He created a course for loan officers to enroll
[00:04:28] and to teach the fundamentals of the sales process,
[00:04:30] how to become the best advisor possible,
[00:04:32] how to get the most out of this career path
[00:04:34] and tips on succeeding in any market.
[00:04:36] You may know him from bigger pockets
[00:04:38] or from really anywhere people are talking about lending.
[00:04:42] Christian Batchelder, his website for the brokerage
[00:04:44] is the one brokerage one is the number one brokerage,
[00:04:48] the one brokerage.com, please check them out
[00:04:51] and consider using Christian on your next client purchase
[00:04:54] or your next purchase.
[00:04:56] He and his team would love the opportunity to talk with you.
[00:04:59] Christian, welcome back to the show.
[00:05:01] Absolutely, happy to be here.
[00:05:03] Yeah, happy to have you here.
[00:05:04] We got some pretty good news
[00:05:06] and I don't really love talking about chasing rates
[00:05:09] because rates are at least in the primary home buyer
[00:05:12] in seller market.
[00:05:13] I never think they're the biggest driver for activity.
[00:05:17] Of course, we're not at 3% rates that we were in in 2021
[00:05:21] and 2022, but we're not at the high of 2023
[00:05:26] and even last year, we are currently at a low for the year
[00:05:30] and anticipation for the FedRate being cut next month.
[00:05:34] And that has hopefully drummed up some interest from buyers
[00:05:38] who are sitting on the sidelines.
[00:05:40] And again, it's not a massive rate cut,
[00:05:43] but you can find rates now in the 6.6 to 6.8 space,
[00:05:49] which is kind of exciting, I guess,
[00:05:50] if you were sitting and waiting.
[00:05:52] So just wanted to get your take on kind of what's going on
[00:05:55] and what agents should know about it.
[00:05:57] Yeah, I mean, the general consensus
[00:05:59] is the Fed's gonna drop the federal funds rate
[00:06:01] by what will most likely be a quarter percent in September.
[00:06:05] And that's something we haven't been able to say for a while,
[00:06:07] right?
[00:06:07] They've kept the federal funds rate stagnant
[00:06:09] for quite the last few meetings now at this point.
[00:06:14] And the betting market so that you guys understand
[00:06:17] kind of how the Fed operates,
[00:06:21] mortgage pricing and really all consumer debt pricing
[00:06:24] in terms of interest rates,
[00:06:27] they follow what things are projected to happen,
[00:06:31] not what are happening.
[00:06:33] So, you know, like last month this month when the Fed says,
[00:06:36] hey, we're keeping the rate unmoved,
[00:06:38] the market doesn't really care, they already knew that, right?
[00:06:41] What they care about is what they're likely to do next month
[00:06:43] because Lenders price aggressively to get ahead of things.
[00:06:46] The same thing I usually compare it to sports betting,
[00:06:48] you know, you always hear like the lines in Vegas,
[00:06:50] like somebody, you know, the Lakers are 100 point favorite
[00:06:53] or a plus 100 underdog or whatever the case is, right?
[00:06:57] What that means is that there's already kind of been
[00:06:59] an expectation placed on the likelihood of the Lakers winning,
[00:07:02] right?
[00:07:03] That's exactly what happens.
[00:07:04] And books are willing to pay you out
[00:07:06] based on the likelihood of them winning.
[00:07:08] They determine them to be your favorites or underdogs.
[00:07:11] It's the same exact thing that happens with the market.
[00:07:13] Market makers, these large banks and people's much smarter than me
[00:07:17] are paid and employed to deduce what the wording is
[00:07:22] that the Fed uses in their meetings
[00:07:23] and what is likely based on the market events
[00:07:26] and market criteria, what the Fed is likely to do next month
[00:07:31] and what banks do is they get ahead of it.
[00:07:32] They set the lines, so to speak, right?
[00:07:36] And the line has very clearly been defined
[00:07:40] that a drop is happening in September.
[00:07:43] These people are very rarely wrong.
[00:07:45] It does happen, it's rare.
[00:07:47] It usually happens when things out of our control happen.
[00:07:50] The last time where it really happened
[00:07:52] in a significant time period was COVID.
[00:07:54] And that's just because nobody knew what would happen
[00:07:56] when the world's being shut down, right?
[00:07:58] That's kind of one of those things that you don't prepare for.
[00:08:00] It's happened usually around wars.
[00:08:03] It's happened around major stock events, things like that.
[00:08:08] But on a typical, not surprising month,
[00:08:13] these people are good at predicting what will happen.
[00:08:15] And I am fully under the belief
[00:08:17] and maybe somebody will point back to this video
[00:08:19] and tell me I was wrong if it doesn't happen.
[00:08:21] But I believe the Fed will cut rates by a quarter percent
[00:08:23] in September and that's already baked in the mortgage price.
[00:08:26] Yeah, it's already moved.
[00:08:27] That's correct.
[00:08:28] So just in the last two to three months here
[00:08:30] as this prediction has kind of started to take place,
[00:08:33] rates have come down from an average of about seven,
[00:08:35] which is where they were for just your standard primary
[00:08:38] residence down into the mid to low sixes.
[00:08:40] So you can very realistically get a 6.2 to a 6.5 rate
[00:08:43] right now on a primary residence,
[00:08:45] which we have not been able to say for almost a year now,
[00:08:47] which is summer leaf.
[00:08:49] Obviously it's not back to the three and fours
[00:08:51] where we would like it to see.
[00:08:53] But it is some crack in the arm or so to speak of the,
[00:08:57] at least short-term history,
[00:09:01] unwillingness to pivot of the Fed, right?
[00:09:04] And it's nice because usually once they start to pivot,
[00:09:07] it continues that way for a little bit.
[00:09:10] Usually they don't cut rates once
[00:09:11] and they're not moving them again for a year.
[00:09:13] Usually when they start cutting that kind of shows their desire
[00:09:16] of the economic progress and they usually more to follow,
[00:09:20] right?
[00:09:20] Very rarely in history as the Fed just made one rate movement
[00:09:23] and then kept it stable.
[00:09:24] Usually when they start to drop,
[00:09:26] they continue until they reach their target
[00:09:28] that they would like to get to.
[00:09:30] So I'm hoping it continues after September
[00:09:32] and to the next year and next year,
[00:09:34] we'll see what happens.
[00:09:36] But it's a good first sign.
[00:09:38] I'll put it that way.
[00:09:39] Yeah, I think it's a good opportunity for agents
[00:09:42] to just communicate what's happening right now,
[00:09:45] whether their clients are,
[00:09:47] especially their already existing primary home,
[00:09:49] I mean, primary home by people who already own homes
[00:09:53] are already at a 3%, 4% rate if they refinanced,
[00:09:57] which they probably did three years ago.
[00:09:59] And now they're probably not looking to move.
[00:10:02] This isn't news enough to sort of jump on the ball,
[00:10:05] unless they have to, unless there's a life event.
[00:10:07] But if there is this need to move in the next 12 to 24 months,
[00:10:11] if I was an agent who was practicing,
[00:10:13] I would be starting calling my sellers,
[00:10:16] my buyer, sorry, my owners rather,
[00:10:18] and say, hey, rates have dropped a little bit.
[00:10:20] There aren't a lot of buyers yet floating in the market,
[00:10:22] although it's also kind of the end of the busy season.
[00:10:24] So it might be time to at least start looking
[00:10:26] at what you want to buy next,
[00:10:28] because we know you can take a look at the data
[00:10:31] and say, homes in your neighborhood
[00:10:32] with most major markets are selling pretty quickly right now.
[00:10:36] Although we did see an uptick in the last month
[00:10:39] where it days on market did increase a bit.
[00:10:41] I think that has to do a lot with just the end of the sales cycle.
[00:10:44] We have kids going back to school,
[00:10:47] parents not wanting to move as much around that same time,
[00:10:50] but we're seeing less competition.
[00:10:52] So I think there's definitely an opportunity there
[00:10:57] to just have that conversation, say, hey,
[00:10:59] let's get you on some safe searches.
[00:11:02] Let's take a look at what your next move wants to be,
[00:11:04] because there's not as many buyers right now,
[00:11:06] and yet rates are a little bit lower.
[00:11:08] We can sell your place pretty quickly
[00:11:10] based on historical data.
[00:11:11] And just have that conversation
[00:11:13] and get them at least in the mindset
[00:11:15] of possibly starting to look.
[00:11:18] Yeah, 100%.
[00:11:19] And I mean, it's important to keep in mind
[00:11:22] the type of properties that you're targeting, right?
[00:11:26] And who else may be interested in them?
[00:11:28] This is the biggest thing that I think REALTORS forget
[00:11:30] and really home buyers, mainly forget is
[00:11:34] if you're targeting a property
[00:11:35] that for instance may make a good primary residence.
[00:11:37] Does that coincide with a property
[00:11:39] that may also make a good rental, right?
[00:11:42] If you're looking for a property
[00:11:43] where maybe you want to do a live in flip or a house hack,
[00:11:46] are you looking at a property that may need renovation?
[00:11:49] If so, you're probably competing with a flipper, right?
[00:11:52] If you're looking for a property that's
[00:11:53] in a good school district,
[00:11:55] are you competing with everybody
[00:11:56] who has a desire for that, right?
[00:11:58] So when you're targeting properties,
[00:12:00] kind of fracturing what your expectations are
[00:12:03] in terms of, I need this, I need this,
[00:12:06] I need this, can a lot of times give you access
[00:12:09] to better opportunities, right?
[00:12:11] Where if you're in one of the markets in America
[00:12:13] that is very heavy in investments, right?
[00:12:16] I think of like the Midwest, right?
[00:12:18] If you're in Cleveland, if you're in Indianapolis,
[00:12:20] if you're in Memphis, if you're in,
[00:12:21] you know, these traditionally more investor-centric markets,
[00:12:25] is there a benefit of maybe you going outside
[00:12:28] into the suburbs a little bit?
[00:12:29] Is there a benefit to you getting outside of the city center
[00:12:31] where you may not get as many investors
[00:12:33] and there may be more opportunity?
[00:12:35] Now sure, you're trading off maybe a different school district
[00:12:38] that commute to work, et cetera,
[00:12:40] but you're artificially limiting the desire
[00:12:44] for those properties and putting yourself
[00:12:46] in a better position to get your offer accepted, right?
[00:12:49] And that's why I think agents,
[00:12:50] while location mastery is a part of being a good agent,
[00:12:57] understanding your market, understanding,
[00:12:59] you know, all the uniquenesses to the market
[00:13:01] that you're working in, being able to pivot
[00:13:04] with your buyers into neighboring zip codes,
[00:13:07] into different asset types, you know, maybe a duplex,
[00:13:10] maybe a triplex, right?
[00:13:11] These things that they may just be opening up their capability
[00:13:16] of actually getting something into contract
[00:13:17] because there's a different level of competition,
[00:13:19] I think is very important, right?
[00:13:21] And remember, even though that 6% doesn't look as good
[00:13:26] as that 4% for you as your primary residence,
[00:13:29] an investor may love it, right?
[00:13:31] An investor may look at that property
[00:13:32] and see the tax benefit, they may see depreciation happening,
[00:13:36] they may see the cash flow, they may see the value
[00:13:38] add potential, and they're not buying it
[00:13:41] for the reasons you are, right?
[00:13:44] And that's why, you know, getting an agent
[00:13:45] who can get an understanding of, you know,
[00:13:47] what interests that property's gonna have,
[00:13:48] maybe somebody who has some experience
[00:13:50] listing homes in that area, right?
[00:13:52] It is vital to getting your offer accepted
[00:13:55] and specifically for the agents,
[00:13:57] being able to answer these questions are important, right?
[00:13:59] Like who's gonna be my potential competition on this deal?
[00:14:03] And how can we make sure that we structure our offer
[00:14:04] in a way that puts us in the best chance
[00:14:06] of getting it accepted, right?
[00:14:08] Very, very, very important.
[00:14:10] I'd like to talk a little bit about tariffs,
[00:14:13] only because we're hearing a lot of that
[00:14:15] currently in the news, tariffs are finally starting
[00:14:18] to come to fruition, and I always wonder
[00:14:21] about how that affects developers,
[00:14:23] because I always think developers are the canary
[00:14:25] and the coal mine for sort of knowing
[00:14:27] what's going on in the housing market,
[00:14:29] and even though they look for very different things
[00:14:31] than primary buyers and sellers,
[00:14:33] it still tells us kind of the sort of the,
[00:14:37] what's the scent of the market at the moment?
[00:14:43] So what are you seeing and hearing from investors?
[00:14:45] You work with a lot of them, developers,
[00:14:48] you know, are they worried about, especially builders?
[00:14:51] Are they worried about tariffs?
[00:14:53] Yeah, tariffs obviously are always gonna have an impact
[00:14:56] because of cost materials, right?
[00:14:59] You know, steel, lumber, piping,
[00:15:01] you know, it has to come from somewhere, right?
[00:15:03] And if it's coming from out of the country,
[00:15:04] which historically a lot of it has,
[00:15:07] you know, American manufacturing isn't what it used to be,
[00:15:10] right? We get a lot of our supplies
[00:15:11] out of the country now at this point.
[00:15:13] A 100% that's gonna impact the cost of their development.
[00:15:17] Now, what a lot of builders are doing,
[00:15:21] as their end product, right?
[00:15:23] Their finished houses sit on market
[00:15:26] and maybe don't have the same buyer pool
[00:15:28] that they thought they would have when they started,
[00:15:30] they're offering credits, they're offering incentives,
[00:15:33] they're offering lender credits, builder credits, right?
[00:15:36] And what that means is that they are trying their best,
[00:15:39] so that you guys understand when you see a builder offering,
[00:15:42] you know, $20,000 in closing cost credit,
[00:15:44] they're not doing it just out of the, you know,
[00:15:47] good of their heart, right?
[00:15:48] They're not doing it because they really care
[00:15:50] about you as a buyer, they're doing it
[00:15:51] to protect their sales prices.
[00:15:53] Because if they instead were to drop that sales price
[00:15:56] by 20K, what does that do to all of the other properties
[00:15:59] that they built, right?
[00:16:00] That means they're now establishing the market basis
[00:16:03] of what that house was worth.
[00:16:04] And then unit two and unit three and unit four
[00:16:06] and unit five all have to have a 20K price drop
[00:16:09] because they've established the market, right?
[00:16:12] That's what they're trying to avoid.
[00:16:14] Whereas if you work into a seller credit,
[00:16:16] they can keep it at that target price point,
[00:16:18] not impact all their future sales,
[00:16:21] but still give you some incentive to move.
[00:16:24] Now, you know, new builds are tricky
[00:16:27] because you're paying retail price, you know,
[00:16:29] you're not getting a market discount
[00:16:30] because builders are very firm in their sales prices.
[00:16:33] But there is an opportunity there
[00:16:35] where if you are targeting a property
[00:16:37] that's gonna have little very little maintenance
[00:16:39] in your first year owning it,
[00:16:40] it's brand new a lot of times
[00:16:41] it comes with a builder warranty, right?
[00:16:43] It could be a very good opportunity
[00:16:45] to get in with a low operational cost
[00:16:47] and take advantage of these builders
[00:16:50] that are panicking a little bit, right?
[00:16:52] Have them pay your closing costs.
[00:16:53] Have them buy your rate down
[00:16:54] and when we're talking about getting a six
[00:16:56] and a quarter or six and a half rate,
[00:16:58] if I have 20K of builder funds to pay down your rate for,
[00:17:01] you're getting rate in the fives, right?
[00:17:03] Maybe the low fives even.
[00:17:05] And it gives you much more flexibility
[00:17:09] where if you're pre-approved with your lender
[00:17:12] at, you know, a 500K purchase price
[00:17:14] in this new builds at $5.50,
[00:17:16] that may be above your threshold,
[00:17:19] but that's assuming you get the market interest rate, right?
[00:17:21] And maybe within your threshold,
[00:17:22] if you can use that builder incentive
[00:17:24] and buy it way down.
[00:17:26] So, you know, obviously there's opportunities everywhere.
[00:17:31] Builders, I think, are a very unique one
[00:17:32] where like, personally, with you,
[00:17:34] I don't really care if builders are struggling or not,
[00:17:36] I care about how my buyers can take advantage of it.
[00:17:38] Sure.
[00:17:38] Just being transparent with you.
[00:17:40] Sure.
[00:17:41] And if a builder struggling is gonna lead
[00:17:43] to my buyer saving $10,000 in interest
[00:17:45] over the course of a 30 year loan, good.
[00:17:47] I hope they struggle.
[00:17:49] Right, let's get better deals for our clients.
[00:17:52] But yes, to answer your question just generally,
[00:17:55] I am seeing some builder uncertainty
[00:17:59] and it's usually displayed based on these incentives
[00:18:03] that you get when you buy.
[00:18:05] And whether or not that's the quote unquote
[00:18:07] canary in the quote,
[00:18:07] in the comment that could be a question that's brought up
[00:18:11] because the downwind effects of that
[00:18:13] is that builders just stop building.
[00:18:15] And that's a problem, right?
[00:18:17] And that's, you know, I have my personal opinions on
[00:18:19] things that the government should do
[00:18:21] to incentivize building and to, you know,
[00:18:26] maybe some tax credits, maybe some state run programs,
[00:18:30] something that gives these builders a reason
[00:18:34] to continue doing this instead of just taking
[00:18:35] these big haircuts that they're doing at the end of their deals.
[00:18:39] You know, and that's a whole political debate
[00:18:42] of, you know, why are we giving builders more money?
[00:18:44] But in, you know, in theory, you do that
[00:18:47] and it increases, you know, the opportunity of people
[00:18:51] to buy homes, it decreases the housing gap
[00:18:55] and ultimately gets more people home
[00:18:56] and that's what we all really want to see.
[00:18:58] I want everybody to see owning their own property, right?
[00:19:01] I think that would put America in a bunch better position.
[00:19:03] And I know you are such a champion
[00:19:06] for real estate agents investing in obviously cash flow
[00:19:10] properties, which obviously there's so many benefits
[00:19:13] to doing that, but there's also a skill set to learn.
[00:19:16] And many agents really only work with primary buyers
[00:19:20] and sellers, they only have a primary home themselves
[00:19:23] and they don't really know the lingo,
[00:19:25] they don't understand you, even in high interest
[00:19:28] or in environments, we're making lots of investments
[00:19:31] in the last, you know, 12 to 24 months,
[00:19:34] you continue to do so.
[00:19:35] So rates don't really affect you much, I guess,
[00:19:39] obviously they're important, but at the end of the day,
[00:19:41] you're looking for things like depreciation, tax advantages,
[00:19:45] you're looking for cash flow, you know,
[00:19:47] walk us through just a little bit about how you,
[00:19:50] and also by the way, you look all over the country.
[00:19:53] You're also not somebody that just looks locally
[00:19:55] and to be able to make something work in another state
[00:19:59] where someone else is managing it is, you know,
[00:20:01] and even that even increases the skill level,
[00:20:05] I suppose, or the difficulty.
[00:20:07] And yet you do that consistently.
[00:20:09] So not to give away, you know, do a whole course, of course,
[00:20:13] here on this episode, but what do you look for
[00:20:16] when you're looking at properties to invest?
[00:20:18] Cause I know you're always looking.
[00:20:20] Yeah, I mean, I have kind of my buy box, so to speak.
[00:20:24] You know, and I teach people how to set up their buy boxes.
[00:20:29] I would say there's not one that's always gonna be
[00:20:31] the best fit for everybody,
[00:20:32] cause there's different levels of risk and reward, right?
[00:20:35] My investing strategy is a little riskier, you know,
[00:20:38] admittingly, but I've determined that that risk
[00:20:41] is worth taking for the potential reward, right?
[00:20:44] I'm a short-term rental investor, so I provide,
[00:20:48] you know, vacation amenities, I believe in providing
[00:20:51] a good experience.
[00:20:52] I do not target typically more suburban areas,
[00:20:57] because I don't really wanna take homes from people
[00:20:59] who are living there, right?
[00:21:01] I target vacation destinations.
[00:21:02] I target places where people don't really live,
[00:21:04] you know, up in the middle of the Smoky Mountains,
[00:21:06] in Tennessee, for instance, nobody's like living there.
[00:21:08] Nobody's living in a big cabin, right?
[00:21:10] Those are typically places that people go to for a vacation,
[00:21:13] for an experience, for, you know, an opportunity to get in one
[00:21:17] with nature, you know, get in touch with nature,
[00:21:19] or whatever the case is.
[00:21:21] So, you know, I do have a big challenge
[00:21:23] with the surge of Airbnb's, and kind of a moral dilemma there
[00:21:27] that, you know, I don't wanna be taking grandma's house
[00:21:29] and turning it into an Airbnb, right?
[00:21:33] Which I think people should pay more attention to,
[00:21:34] cause even though the numbers may work,
[00:21:36] like what are we really accomplishing there, right?
[00:21:39] But just in terms of my buy box, obviously,
[00:21:41] I do look for cash flow, but it's not the only thing.
[00:21:44] I look for value add opportunities,
[00:21:46] so places that I can get into lower than the market,
[00:21:48] you know, get some seller credit, get some repairs done,
[00:21:51] increase the value of the asset, you know,
[00:21:53] and really my biggest motivation in investing
[00:21:57] is the tax benefits.
[00:21:59] You know, and that sounds like, you know,
[00:22:01] but capitalist, and regardless of your political affiliation,
[00:22:05] there are very defined codes and opportunities
[00:22:09] in the tax code that allow you to, you know,
[00:22:12] really the American government is incentivizing investment.
[00:22:15] Yeah, that's the way to think about it.
[00:22:17] And if I can put $100,000 into the down payment
[00:22:21] of a property instead of sending it to the IRS,
[00:22:24] I'm gonna do that every time.
[00:22:25] Sure, right.
[00:22:26] You know, if you pay a dollar more in taxes,
[00:22:28] then they need to.
[00:22:29] Exactly, you know, and all these people that you hear,
[00:22:31] you know, brag, if you guys are, you know,
[00:22:33] following real estate people like, you know,
[00:22:35] Roba Kiyosaki always brags it.
[00:22:36] I don't pay taxes because I'm smart, you know,
[00:22:39] or Trump said that, right?
[00:22:40] Trump said like, I remember when he was debating Hillary Clinton,
[00:22:42] he said, I don't pay taxes because of the system you created,
[00:22:45] right?
[00:22:45] 
[00:22:46] It's not like these people are brilliant.
[00:22:48] It's not like they're paying their CPAs,
[00:22:50] hundreds of thousands of dollars to commit tax fraud.
[00:22:52] They're doing one thing and one thing only.
[00:22:55] They are depreciating real estate.
[00:22:57] Yeah.
[00:22:57] That's it.
[00:22:58] That's the secret.
[00:22:59] There's no crazy special tax code.
[00:23:01] There's no work around.
[00:23:02] There's no fraud happening.
[00:23:04] They are depreciating real estate and they're wiping out
[00:23:07] their personal income for them.
[00:23:09] 
[00:23:09] Yeah, and you can front load depreciation in a lot of cases.
[00:23:13] That's right.
[00:23:13] Yeah, I mean, I can run through the numbers of my property
[00:23:16] that I bought.
[00:23:16] I bought about, it's about a $1.5, $1.6 million property
[00:23:20] in the Smoky Mountains.
[00:23:22] Very nice cabin.
[00:23:23] It probably won't cash flow.
[00:23:26] Probably won't be fully transparent, right?
[00:23:28] It'll probably just cover the mortgage and that's about it.
[00:23:30] Maybe even have a monthly expense to me.
[00:23:32] But it gave me a $350,000 tax write off.
[00:23:36] So I don't really care if it cash flows
[00:23:38] because that was probably $150,000 to $200,000
[00:23:41] that I was sent to the IRS instead.
[00:23:43] Instead, I put that as a down payment on the property
[00:23:46] and I actually got something back for it.
[00:23:48] What do you get for the money you send to the IRS?
[00:23:53] Too debatable, right?
[00:23:55] But I don't feel like I get much.
[00:23:57] So I'd rather that go into a property and fully legal,
[00:24:00] not doing anything weird, nothing, nothing morally ambiguous, right?
[00:24:06] I'm taking advantage of the incentives
[00:24:08] that the IRS has put in the US tax code,
[00:24:11] which is allowed, right?
[00:24:14] Yeah, it's really interesting.
[00:24:16] And there's all sorts of opportunities
[00:24:17] where even if somebody doesn't want to do short-term rentals
[00:24:22] or long-term rentals or deal with managing a property
[00:24:26] or even paying someone to manage a property,
[00:24:27] there's syndication deals that you can get involved in.
[00:24:31] And those are really interesting.
[00:24:32] I find those to be sort of investing light.
[00:24:35] You know, a little bit less risk.
[00:24:37] You let another group do all the heavy lifting
[00:24:40] and you still get to appreciate,
[00:24:42] or sorry, you still get to take advantage of the depreciation.
[00:24:46] And you know, there's a lot of good reasons
[00:24:48] why people do that and you basically buy shares
[00:24:51] of a trust that's, you know, doing like a commercial development
[00:24:55] or a commercial, you know, a retail center, for example.
[00:24:59] And I've found, there's all sorts of really cool ways.
[00:25:02] And agents would do themselves well to learn
[00:25:05] some of these tactics and strategies
[00:25:07] because really they can bring that to their buyers,
[00:25:11] their primary home residents buyers to increase,
[00:25:13] you know, their net worth through a passive investing,
[00:25:16] or even just reduce, like you said, your tax liability
[00:25:19] for your primary income.
[00:25:21] I mean, jeez, if I could reduce mine by 200,000,
[00:25:25] that would be a really nice day.
[00:25:28] And we're always looking for opportunities to do that.
[00:25:31] Where are you seeing in short-term rentals?
[00:25:34] Are you seeing still a lot of opportunities
[00:25:36] in various markets?
[00:25:38] Or is that getting more saturated now
[00:25:40] since Airbnb is so popular?
[00:25:42] Obviously, there's just more investors
[00:25:44] or more people willing to take those properties
[00:25:46] and do that short-term investing?
[00:25:48] Is there short-term rentals?
[00:25:49] Is that more challenging these days?
[00:25:51] I would say it's challenging for probably reasons
[00:25:54] that people wouldn't anticipate.
[00:25:57] I don't think it's over saturated.
[00:25:58] I think it's under-saturated with good ones,
[00:26:01] over-saturated with bad ones, right?
[00:26:03] In the same way that I lit off with,
[00:26:04] everybody was trying to convert grandma's house
[00:26:06] to new and Airbnb.
[00:26:07] There's a reason why that didn't work, right?
[00:26:09] But providing a unique experience in a unique market
[00:26:13] that stands out, there's still a supreme lack of that, right?
[00:26:17] I don't know how much you travel, I travel a lot for work.
[00:26:21] I stay in Airbnb's when I travel.
[00:26:22] I don't remember the whole thing.
[00:26:23] Oh, yeah, almost always do.
[00:26:25] Yeah, I don't remember the last time I was in a hotel.
[00:26:27] And I can count probably on one hand
[00:26:29] the really good top of the line experiences
[00:26:33] that I've had in Airbnb's.
[00:26:34] And it's unfortunate.
[00:26:35] I have an experience very many good ones.
[00:26:38] And that's something that if that's your desire,
[00:26:42] you should do it in a way that number one
[00:26:44] doesn't take homes away from regular home buyers.
[00:26:47] But number two, if you're gonna do it, do it well.
[00:26:49] It's just like anything.
[00:26:50] Like I wouldn't recommend you go to work
[00:26:52] and like half-ass your job.
[00:26:54] Like if you're gonna work, work good, right?
[00:26:56] Work well, shoot for that promotion,
[00:26:59] potentially pick up over time, whatever the case is, right?
[00:27:03] Anything worth doing is worth doing well in my book.
[00:27:06] And a lot of people, you know,
[00:27:08] instead of trying to adhere to those kind of standards,
[00:27:12] they pull up Air DNA and they look at cash flow
[00:27:15] and they say, oh, cool, though, that looks easy.
[00:27:17] And it's not.
[00:27:18] And people get dismayed for IOT and people get, you know,
[00:27:21] they beat themselves up because they failed.
[00:27:23] But really, you failed in planning not executing.
[00:27:26] You know, you just didn't plan it well.
[00:27:28] So for people who are looking to do that
[00:27:30] and actually provide a value,
[00:27:33] I do not think it's over-saturated at all.
[00:27:35] I think there is plenty of opportunity for good operators.
[00:27:38] And that goes with long-term rentals too.
[00:27:40] You know, how many long-term rentals do you know
[00:27:42] that people like really love their landlord?
[00:27:44] Right.
[00:27:45] Probably not very many,
[00:27:46] but the ones that do pay their rent on time
[00:27:48] and have a much better experience, right?
[00:27:50] Like as a landlord, you should care
[00:27:52] about how comfortable and confident you are in your tenants.
[00:27:54] You should.
[00:27:55] That's a big impact of success and investing.
[00:27:59] You know, it's funny.
[00:27:59] One of the little sort of funny sort of truths
[00:28:03] about short-term rentals,
[00:28:05] which I wouldn't have been guessed
[00:28:08] because I'm not a short-term rental investor myself.
[00:28:12] But that actually the wear and tear on properties
[00:28:15] tends to be much less than,
[00:28:17] which of course makes sense if you think about it
[00:28:18] then long-term rentals
[00:28:19] because they're in and out of there in a couple of days.
[00:28:22] They're not putting as much stress on the property
[00:28:24] in most cases.
[00:28:25] They're not utilizing all of the different rooms
[00:28:27] and amenities they're in and out.
[00:28:30] But it's kind of funny to think that
[00:28:31] more traffic is coming in and out of there,
[00:28:34] but you know, you potentially are maybe holding onto
[00:28:37] that property for longer than even having a great tenant
[00:28:40] in there 12 months of the year.
[00:28:42] Yeah, well, you're also checking in on it more, right?
[00:28:44] In between every stay, usually.
[00:28:45] Yeah, like a point.
[00:28:46] So like if you have somebody who pops a leak in the bathroom,
[00:28:50] you know, in the sink or the tub
[00:28:53] or the shower head or something leaks,
[00:28:55] a long-term tenant may just say,
[00:28:56] oh, it's not really big deal
[00:28:57] and let it leak for 12 months.
[00:28:59] And like how much damage is done over that time?
[00:29:01] Whereas if something pops a leak on a two-night stay,
[00:29:05] you're seeing it after their two-night stay, right?
[00:29:07] Your cleaner manager, your maintenance tech goes in
[00:29:09] and says, oh, hey, problem, let's fix it.
[00:29:11] So your response rate is much quicker.
[00:29:14] Now, obviously, if you have a really good,
[00:29:17] responsible tenant that notifies you,
[00:29:19] then that's kind of remedied a little bit there.
[00:29:23] But it's forced on a short-term rental, right?
[00:29:27] Yeah.
[00:29:29] Things are brought to your intent.
[00:29:30] Now, it sucks because your operation costs are heavier
[00:29:32] because you're fixing things more often, right?
[00:29:34] But it limits those huge expenses
[00:29:37] that come from significant neglect that happens
[00:29:41] when somebody stays there for 12, 24, 36 months at a time, right?
[00:29:46] Yeah.
[00:29:47] And again, just the idea, if I was an agent
[00:29:50] that was looking into either getting into short-term
[00:29:53] rentals or long-term rentals
[00:29:55] and just trying to find my first property,
[00:29:57] whether it's in my local area or in the case,
[00:30:01] what your buy box, you're looking in vacation areas
[00:30:04] for short-term, where would you recommend
[00:30:07] then I start researching?
[00:30:08] What would be my first step?
[00:30:09] What would be the first place I should go
[00:30:12] to just increase my knowledge set?
[00:30:14] Yeah, number one, I would talk to somebody who does it.
[00:30:16] Yeah.
[00:30:16] You're gonna skip so many mistakes
[00:30:18] by just simple talk to somebody who has done it, right?
[00:30:22] If you're interested about the lending portion
[00:30:23] talk to me, I'm an operator as well.
[00:30:26] You know, there's a lot of services online.
[00:30:29] You know, I know a lot of influencers, people.
[00:30:32] You know, I wouldn't go pay for a $10 or $20,000 course
[00:30:34] probably, right?
[00:30:35] There's plenty of them that you can go
[00:30:37] and send money to and they'll give you a buy box.
[00:30:39] But there's a lot of free information as well, right?
[00:30:42] I'd educate yourself first, second, and third priority
[00:30:46] and then start to execute your plan only once you have
[00:30:48] at least a base level amount of confidence
[00:30:52] and you're being advised by a good team, right?
[00:30:55] Somebody who knows the system,
[00:30:57] talk to some property managers, right?
[00:30:59] Talk to an investor-minded agent in the area, right?
[00:31:02] If that's you, increase your knowledge
[00:31:04] about investor-minded purchases, right?
[00:31:09] It's the power is in your network and your knowledge
[00:31:12] almost in every aspect of real estate,
[00:31:14] even if you're buying your primary home, right?
[00:31:16] The way that your agent negotiates
[00:31:18] or you being a listener as the agent negotiate,
[00:31:21] like that's like half of the success of the borrower's,
[00:31:25] you know, game plan there is what you buy it for.
[00:31:28] Right.
[00:31:29] What the terms you get on it is,
[00:31:30] what your structure is when you first enter, right?
[00:31:33] I mean, you can do all the post purchase things
[00:31:35] you want, all the renovations, all the thing,
[00:31:37] but if you didn't buy it,
[00:31:39] well, the whole thing get crumbled, right?
[00:31:41] Yeah, I even, it's funny, you're talking about, you know,
[00:31:44] finding experts in your local area.
[00:31:46] I am looking to make a move here in the next four to six months
[00:31:50] and I just called the top agents in the area
[00:31:53] that I'm looking to buy in,
[00:31:54] even though I'm technically an agent
[00:31:55] and I'm not gonna be using them.
[00:31:57] I called them and I said,
[00:31:58] hey, I'm moving into your area,
[00:31:59] you're one of the top,
[00:32:00] you have some of the most market share in this area.
[00:32:02] What do I need to know about buying in this area?
[00:32:04] Well, I wasn't sure that they would talk to me
[00:32:06] because tactically, I guess I'm competition in a sense
[00:32:09] or if it's one of their listings not,
[00:32:11] but, you know, I wanted to know their secrets.
[00:32:13] I was shocked.
[00:32:14] They were like, oh, this is what you need to know.
[00:32:16] I was weird.
[00:32:17] They will give it away for free.
[00:32:19] Absolutely.
[00:32:20] And the team on the investor side,
[00:32:21] it is, especially investors,
[00:32:23] investors really love to talk to other investors.
[00:32:26] They love to knowledge share.
[00:32:28] They love to just network because again,
[00:32:31] they trade properties sometimes as well.
[00:32:33] It's this network of not everything hits the MLS
[00:32:36] and there's a lot of properties that sort of
[00:32:39] are through just backdoor channels of people
[00:32:41] who are networked together.
[00:32:43] Certainly, investors are that way as well as developers.
[00:32:47] So yeah, great, great, you know, great thing
[00:32:50] that I think our agents or our listeners
[00:32:52] or our agents should be reaching out to you
[00:32:54] even for their primary home buy.

He together with David Green, Christian co-founded the one brokerage, deemed the fastest growing broker in the nation in 2021 and 2022 ranked in the top 20 brokerages by funded loan volume. Christians at UC Berkeley grad. He has a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering but hated the industry and wanted to get out of caped earning potential.

He teaches people everything from investing principles to how and how to buy your 1000th property with a focus on what markets to target, how to find the best loan and how to protect one's investments with insurance policies and other forms of asset protection. He has purchased 15 properties himself in the last 12 months and has an amazing strategy for all of us to consider doing a similar thing, maybe not that many properties in a year, but certainly buying investment properties. There's a lot of our listeners that have not taken the plunge there or they just want to learn to work with investors. Christian is kind of an expert in all things investments but he's going to talk about these same principles that he teaches, he does himself. He created a course for loan officers to enroll and to teach the fundamentals of the sales process, how to become the best advisor possible, how to get the most out of this career path and tips on succeeding in any market.

He and his team would love the opportunity to talk with you. Christian, welcome back to the show. Absolutely, happy to be here. Yeah, happy to have you here. We got some pretty good news and I don't really love talking about chasing rates because rates are at least in the primary home buyer in seller market. I never think they're the biggest driver for activity. Of course, we're not at 3% rates that we were in in 2021 and 2022, but we're not at the high of 2023 and even last year, we are currently at a low for the year and anticipation for the FedRate being cut next month. And that has hopefully drummed up some interest from buyers who are sitting on the sidelines. And again, it's not a massive rate cut, but you can find rates now in the 6.6 to 6.8 space, which is kind of exciting, I guess, if you were sitting and waiting. So just wanted to get your take on kind of what's going on and what agents should know about it. Yeah, I mean, the general consensus is the Fed's gonna drop the federal funds rate by what will most likely be a quarter percent in September. And that's something we haven't been able to say for a while, right? They've kept the federal funds rate stagnant for quite the last few meetings now at this point. And the betting market so that you guys understand kind of how the Fed operates, mortgage pricing and really all consumer debt pricing in terms of interest rates, they follow what things are projected to happen, not what are happening. So, you know, like last month this month when the Fed says, hey, we're keeping the rate unmoved, the market doesn't really care, they already knew that, right? What they care about is what they're likely to do next month because Lenders price aggressively to get ahead of things. The same thing I usually compare it to sports betting, you know, you always hear like the lines in Vegas, like somebody, you know, the Lakers are 100 point favorite or a plus 100 underdog or whatever the case is, right? What that means is that there's already kind of been an expectation placed on the likelihood of the Lakers winning, right? That's exactly what happens. And books are willing to pay you out based on the likelihood of them winning. They determine them to be your favorites or underdogs. It's the same exact thing that happens with the market. Market makers, these large banks and people's much smarter than me are paid and employed to deduce what the wording is that the Fed uses in their meetings and what is likely based on the market events and market criteria, what the Fed is likely to do next month and what banks do is they get ahead of it. They set the lines, so to speak, right? And the line has very clearly been defined that a drop is happening in September. These people are very rarely wrong. It does happen, it's rare. It usually happens when things out of our control happen. The last time where it really happened in a significant time period was COVID. And that's just because nobody knew what would happen when the world's being shut down, right? That's kind of one of those things that you don't prepare for. It's happened usually around wars. It's happened around major stock events, things like that. But on a typical, not surprising month, these people are good at predicting what will happen. And I am fully under the belief and maybe somebody will point back to this video and tell me I was wrong if it doesn't happen. But I believe the Fed will cut rates by a quarter percent in September and that's already baked in the mortgage price. Yeah, it's already moved. That's correct. So just in the last two to three months here as this prediction has kind of started to take place, rates have come down from an average of about seven, which is where they were for just your standard primary residence down into the mid to low sixes. So you can very realistically get a 6.2 to a 6.5 rate right now on a primary residence, which we have not been able to say for almost a year now, which is summer leaf. Obviously it's not back to the three and fours where we would like it to see. But it is some crack in the arm or so to speak of the, at least short-term history, unwillingness to pivot of the Fed, right? And it's nice because usually once they start to pivot, it continues that way for a little bit. Usually they don't cut rates once and they're not moving them again for a year. Usually when they start cutting that kind of shows their desire of the economic progress and they usually more to follow, right? Very rarely in history as the Fed just made one rate movement and then kept it stable. Usually when they start to drop, they continue until they reach their target that they would like to get to. So I'm hoping it continues after September and to the next year and next year, we'll see what happens. But it's a good first sign. I'll put it that way. Yeah, I think it's a good opportunity for agents to just communicate what's happening right now, whether their clients are, especially their already existing primary home, I mean, primary home by people who already own homes are already at a 3%, 4% rate if they refinanced, which they probably did three years ago. And now they're probably not looking to move. This isn't news enough to sort of jump on the ball, unless they have to, unless there's a life event. But if there is this need to move in the next 12 to 24 months, if I was an agent who was practicing, I would be starting calling my sellers, my buyer, sorry, my owners rather, and say, hey, rates have dropped a little bit. There aren't a lot of buyers yet floating in the market, although it's also kind of the end of the busy season. So it might be time to at least start looking at what you want to buy next, because we know you can take a look at the data and say, homes in your neighborhood with most major markets are selling pretty quickly right now. Although we did see an uptick in the last month where it days on market did increase a bit. I think that has to do a lot with just the end of the sales cycle. We have kids going back to school, parents not wanting to move as much around that same time, but we're seeing less competition. So I think there's definitely an opportunity there to just have that conversation, say, hey, let's get you on some safe searches. Let's take a look at what your next move wants to be, because there's not as many buyers right now, and yet rates are a little bit lower. We can sell your place pretty quickly based on historical data. And just have that conversation and get them at least in the mindset of possibly starting to look. Yeah, 100%. And I mean, it's important to keep in mind the type of properties that you're targeting, right? And who else may be interested in them? This is the biggest thing that I think REALTORS forget and really home buyers, mainly forget is if you're targeting a property that for instance may make a good primary residence. Does that coincide with a property that may also make a good rental, right? If you're looking for a property where maybe you want to do a live in flip or a house hack, are you looking at a property that may need renovation? If so, you're probably competing with a flipper, right? If you're looking for a property that's in a good school district, are you competing with everybody who has a desire for that, right? So when you're targeting properties, kind of fracturing what your expectations are in terms of, I need this, I need this, I need this, can a lot of times give you access to better opportunities, right? Where if you're in one of the markets in America that is very heavy in investments, right? I think of like the Midwest, right? If you're in Cleveland, if you're in Indianapolis, if you're in Memphis, if you're in, you know, these traditionally more investor-centric markets, is there a benefit of maybe you going outside into the suburbs a little bit? Is there a benefit to you getting outside of the city center where you may not get as many investors and there may be more opportunity? Now sure, you're trading off maybe a different school district that commute to work, et cetera, but you're artificially limiting the desire for those properties and putting yourself in a better position to get your offer accepted, right? And that's why I think agents, while location mastery is a part of being a good agent, understanding your market, understanding, you know, all the uniquenesses to the market that you're working in, being able to pivot with your buyers into neighboring zip codes, into different asset types, you know, maybe a duplex, maybe a triplex, right? These things that they may just be opening up their capability of actually getting something into contract because there's a different level of competition, I think is very important, right? And remember, even though that 6% doesn't look as good as that 4% for you as your primary residence, an investor may love it, right? An investor may look at that property and see the tax benefit, they may see depreciation happening, they may see the cash flow, they may see the value add potential, and they're not buying it for the reasons you are, right? And that's why, you know, getting an agent who can get an understanding of, you know, what interests that property's gonna have, maybe somebody who has some experience listing homes in that area, right? It is vital to getting your offer accepted and specifically for the agents, being able to answer these questions are important, right? Like who's gonna be my potential competition on this deal? And how can we make sure that we structure our offer in a way that puts us in the best chance of getting it accepted, right? Very, very, very important. I'd like to talk a little bit about tariffs, only because we're hearing a lot of that currently in the news, tariffs are finally starting to come to fruition, and I always wonder about how that affects developers, because I always think developers are the canary and the coal mine for sort of knowing what's going on in the housing market, and even though they look for very different things than primary buyers and sellers, it still tells us kind of the sort of the, what's the scent of the market at the moment? So what are you seeing and hearing from investors? You work with a lot of them, developers, you know, are they worried about, especially builders? Are they worried about tariffs? Yeah, tariffs obviously are always gonna have an impact because of cost materials, right? You know, steel, lumber, piping, you know, it has to come from somewhere, right? And if it's coming from out of the country, which historically a lot of it has, you know, American manufacturing isn't what it used to be, right? We get a lot of our supplies out of the country now at this point. A 100% that's gonna impact the cost of their development. Now, what a lot of builders are doing, as their end product, right? Their finished houses sit on market and maybe don't have the same buyer pool that they thought they would have when they started, they're offering credits, they're offering incentives, they're offering lender credits, builder credits, right? And what that means is that they are trying their best, so that you guys understand when you see a builder offering, you know, $20,000 in closing cost credit, they're not doing it just out of the, you know, good of their heart, right? They're not doing it because they really care about you as a buyer, they're doing it to protect their sales prices. Because if they instead were to drop that sales price by 20K, what does that do to all of the other properties that they built, right? That means they're now establishing the market basis of what that house was worth. And then unit two and unit three and unit four and unit five all have to have a 20K price drop because they've established the market, right? That's what they're trying to avoid. Whereas if you work into a seller credit, they can keep it at that target price point, not impact all their future sales, but still give you some incentive to move. Now, you know, new builds are tricky because you're paying retail price, you know, you're not getting a market discount because builders are very firm in their sales prices. But there is an opportunity there where if you are targeting a property that's gonna have little very little maintenance in your first year owning it, it's brand new a lot of times it comes with a builder warranty, right? It could be a very good opportunity to get in with a low operational cost and take advantage of these builders that are panicking a little bit, right? Have them pay your closing costs. Have them buy your rate down and when we're talking about getting a six and a quarter or six and a half rate, if I have 20K of builder funds to pay down your rate for, you're getting rate in the fives, right? Maybe the low fives even. And it gives you much more flexibility where if you're pre-approved with your lender at, you know, a 500K purchase price in this new builds at $5.50, that may be above your threshold, but that's assuming you get the market interest rate, right? And maybe within your threshold, if you can use that builder incentive and buy it way down. So, you know, obviously there's opportunities everywhere. Builders, I think, are a very unique one where like, personally, with you, I don't really care if builders are struggling or not, I care about how my buyers can take advantage of it. Sure. Just being transparent with you. Sure. And if a builder struggling is gonna lead to my buyer saving $10,000 in interest over the course of a 30 year loan, good. I hope they struggle. Right, let's get better deals for our clients. But yes, to answer your question just generally, I am seeing some builder uncertainty and it's usually displayed based on these incentives that you get when you buy. And whether or not that's the quote unquote canary in the quote, in the comment that could be a question that's brought up because the downwind effects of that is that builders just stop building. And that's a problem, right? And that's, you know, I have my personal opinions on things that the government should do to incentivize building and to, you know, maybe some tax credits, maybe some state run programs, something that gives these builders a reason to continue doing this instead of just taking these big haircuts that they're doing at the end of their deals. You know, and that's a whole political debate of, you know, why are we giving builders more money? But in, you know, in theory, you do that and it increases, you know, the opportunity of people to buy homes, it decreases the housing gap and ultimately gets more people home and that's what we all really want to see. I want everybody to see owning their own property, right? I think that would put America in a bunch better position. And I know you are such a champion for real estate agents investing in obviously cash flow properties, which obviously there's so many benefits to doing that, but there's also a skill set to learn. And many agents really only work with primary buyers and sellers, they only have a primary home themselves and they don't really know the lingo, they don't understand you, even in high interest or in environments, we're making lots of investments in the last, you know, 12 to 24 months, you continue to do so. So rates don't really affect you much, I guess, obviously they're important, but at the end of the day, you're looking for things like depreciation, tax advantages, you're looking for cash flow, you know, walk us through just a little bit about how you, and also by the way, you look all over the country. You're also not somebody that just looks locally and to be able to make something work in another state where someone else is managing it is, you know, and even that even increases the skill level, I suppose, or the difficulty. And yet you do that consistently. So not to give away, you know, do a whole course, of course, here on this episode, but what do you look for when you're looking at properties to invest? Cause I know you're always looking. Yeah, I mean, I have kind of my buy box, so to speak. You know, and I teach people how to set up their buy boxes. I would say there's not one that's always gonna be the best fit for everybody, cause there's different levels of risk and reward, right? My investing strategy is a little riskier, you know, admittingly, but I've determined that that risk is worth taking for the potential reward, right? I'm a short-term rental investor, so I provide, you know, vacation amenities, I believe in providing a good experience. I do not target typically more suburban areas, because I don't really wanna take homes from people who are living there, right? I target vacation destinations. I target places where people don't really live, you know, up in the middle of the Smoky Mountains, in Tennessee, for instance, nobody's like living there. Nobody's living in a big cabin, right? Those are typically places that people go to for a vacation, for an experience, for, you know, an opportunity to get in one with nature, you know, get in touch with nature, or whatever the case is. So, you know, I do have a big challenge with the surge of Airbnb's, and kind of a moral dilemma there that, you know, I don't wanna be taking grandma's house and turning it into an Airbnb, right? Which I think people should pay more attention to, cause even though the numbers may work, like what are we really accomplishing there, right? But just in terms of my buy box, obviously, I do look for cash flow, but it's not the only thing. I look for value add opportunities, so places that I can get into lower than the market, you know, get some seller credit, get some repairs done, increase the value of the asset, you know, and really my biggest motivation in investing is the tax benefits. You know, and that sounds like, you know, but capitalist, and regardless of your political affiliation, there are very defined codes and opportunities in the tax code that allow you to, you know, really the American government is incentivizing investment. Yeah, that's the way to think about it. And if I can put $100,000 into the down payment of a property instead of sending it to the IRS, I'm gonna do that every time. Sure, right. You know, if you pay a dollar more in taxes, then they need to. Exactly, you know, and all these people that you hear, you know, brag, if you guys are, you know, following real estate people like, you know, Roba Kiyosaki always brags it. I don't pay taxes because I'm smart, you know, or Trump said that, right? Trump said like, I remember when he was debating Hillary Clinton, he said, I don't pay taxes because of the system you created, right? It's not like these people are brilliant. It's not like they're paying their CPAs, hundreds of thousands of dollars to commit tax fraud. They're doing one thing and one thing only. They are depreciating real estate. Yeah. That's it. That's the secret. There's no crazy special tax code. There's no work around. There's no fraud happening. They are depreciating real estate and they're wiping out their personal income for them. Yeah, and you can front load depreciation in a lot of cases. That's right. Yeah, I mean, I can run through the numbers of my property that I bought. I bought about, it's about a $1.5, $1.6 million property in the Smoky Mountains. Very nice cabin. It probably won't cash flow. Probably won't be fully transparent, right? It'll probably just cover the mortgage and that's about it. Maybe even have a monthly expense to me. But it gave me a $350,000 tax write off. So I don't really care if it cash flows because that was probably $150,000 to $200,000 that I was sent to the IRS instead. Instead, I put that as a down payment on the property and I actually got something back for it. What do you get for the money you send to the IRS? Too debatable, right? But I don't feel like I get much. So I'd rather that go into a property and fully legal, not doing anything weird, nothing, nothing morally ambiguous, right? I'm taking advantage of the incentives that the IRS has put in the US tax code, which is allowed, right? Yeah, it's really interesting. And there's all sorts of opportunities where even if somebody doesn't want to do short-term rentals or long-term rentals or deal with managing a property or even paying someone to manage a property, there's syndication deals that you can get involved in. And those are really interesting. I find those to be sort of investing light. You know, a little bit less risk. You let another group do all the heavy lifting and you still get to appreciate, or sorry, you still get to take advantage of the depreciation. And you know, there's a lot of good reasons why people do that and you basically buy shares of a trust that's, you know, doing like a commercial development or a commercial, you know, a retail center, for example. And I've found, there's all sorts of really cool ways. And agents would do themselves well to learn some of these tactics and strategies because really they can bring that to their buyers, their primary home residents buyers to increase, you know, their net worth through a passive investing, or even just reduce, like you said, your tax liability for your primary income. I mean, jeez, if I could reduce mine by 200,000, that would be a really nice day. And we're always looking for opportunities to do that. Where are you seeing in short-term rentals? Are you seeing still a lot of opportunities in various markets? Or is that getting more saturated now since Airbnb is so popular? Obviously, there's just more investors or more people willing to take those properties and do that short-term investing? Is there short-term rentals? Is that more challenging these days? I would say it's challenging for probably reasons that people wouldn't anticipate. I don't think it's over saturated. I think it's under-saturated with good ones, over-saturated with bad ones, right? In the same way that I lit off with, everybody was trying to convert grandma's house to new and Airbnb. There's a reason why that didn't work, right? But providing a unique experience in a unique market that stands out, there's still a supreme lack of that, right? I don't know how much you travel, I travel a lot for work. I stay in Airbnb's when I travel. I don't remember the whole thing. Oh, yeah, almost always do. Yeah, I don't remember the last time I was in a hotel. And I can count probably on one hand the really good top of the line experiences that I've had in Airbnb's. And it's unfortunate. I have an experience very many good ones. And that's something that if that's your desire, you should do it in a way that number one doesn't take homes away from regular home buyers. But number two, if you're gonna do it, do it well. It's just like anything. Like I wouldn't recommend you go to work and like half-ass your job. Like if you're gonna work, work good, right? Work well, shoot for that promotion, potentially pick up over time, whatever the case is, right? Anything worth doing is worth doing well in my book. And a lot of people, you know, instead of trying to adhere to those kind of standards, they pull up Air DNA and they look at cash flow and they say, oh, cool, though, that looks easy. And it's not. And people get dismayed for IOT and people get, you know, they beat themselves up because they failed. But really, you failed in planning not executing. You know, you just didn't plan it well. So for people who are looking to do that and actually provide a value, I do not think it's over-saturated at all. I think there is plenty of opportunity for good operators. And that goes with long-term rentals too. You know, how many long-term rentals do you know that people like really love their landlord? Right. Probably not very many, but the ones that do pay their rent on time and have a much better experience, right? Like as a landlord, you should care about how comfortable and confident you are in your tenants. You should. That's a big impact of success and investing. You know, it's funny. One of the little sort of funny sort of truths about short-term rentals, which I wouldn't have been guessed because I'm not a short-term rental investor myself. But that actually the wear and tear on properties tends to be much less than, which of course makes sense if you think about it then long-term rentals because they're in and out of there in a couple of days. They're not putting as much stress on the property in most cases. They're not utilizing all of the different rooms and amenities they're in and out. But it's kind of funny to think that more traffic is coming in and out of there, but you know, you potentially are maybe holding onto that property for longer than even having a great tenant in there 12 months of the year. Yeah, well, you're also checking in on it more, right? In between every stay, usually. Yeah, like a point. So like if you have somebody who pops a leak in the bathroom, you know, in the sink or the tub or the shower head or something leaks, a long-term tenant may just say, oh, it's not really big deal and let it leak for 12 months. And like how much damage is done over that time? Whereas if something pops a leak on a two-night stay, you're seeing it after their two-night stay, right? Your cleaner manager, your maintenance tech goes in and says, oh, hey, problem, let's fix it. So your response rate is much quicker. Now, obviously, if you have a really good, responsible tenant that notifies you, then that's kind of remedied a little bit there. But it's forced on a short-term rental, right? Yeah. Things are brought to your intent. Now, it sucks because your operation costs are heavier because you're fixing things more often, right? But it limits those huge expenses that come from significant neglect that happens when somebody stays there for 12, 24, 36 months at a time, right? Yeah. And again, just the idea, if I was an agent that was looking into either getting into short-term rentals or long-term rentals and just trying to find my first property, whether it's in my local area or in the case, what your buy box, you're looking in vacation areas for short-term, where would you recommend then I start researching? What would be my first step? What would be the first place I should go to just increase my knowledge set? Yeah, number one, I would talk to somebody who does it. Yeah. You're gonna skip so many mistakes by just simple talk to somebody who has done it, right? If you're interested about the lending portion talk to me, I'm an operator as well. You know, there's a lot of services online. You know, I know a lot of influencers, people. You know, I wouldn't go pay for a $10 or $20,000 course probably, right? There's plenty of them that you can go and send money to and they'll give you a buy box. But there's a lot of free information as well, right? I'd educate yourself first, second, and third priority and then start to execute your plan only once you have at least a base level amount of confidence and you're being advised by a good team, right? Somebody who knows the system, talk to some property managers, right? Talk to an investor-minded agent in the area, right? If that's you, increase your knowledge about investor-minded purchases, right? It's the power is in your network and your knowledge almost in every aspect of real estate, even if you're buying your primary home, right? The way that your agent negotiates or you being a listener as the agent negotiate, like that's like half of the success of the borrower's, you know, game plan there is what you buy it for. Right. What the terms you get on it is, what your structure is when you first enter, right? I mean, you can do all the post purchase things you want, all the renovations, all the thing, but if you didn't buy it, well, the whole thing get crumbled, right? Yeah, I even, it's funny, you're talking about, you know, finding experts in your local area. I am looking to make a move here in the next four to six months and I just called the top agents in the area that I'm looking to buy in, even though I'm technically an agent and I'm not gonna be using them. I called them and I said, hey, I'm moving into your area, you're one of the top, you have some of the most market share in this area. What do I need to know about buying in this area? Well, I wasn't sure that they would talk to me because tactically, I guess I'm competition in a sense or if it's one of their listings not, but, you know, I wanted to know their secrets. I was shocked. They were like, oh, this is what you need to know. I was weird. They will give it away for free. Absolutely. And the team on the investor side, it is, especially investors, investors really love to talk to other investors. They love to knowledge share. They love to just network because again, they trade properties sometimes as well. It's this network of not everything hits the MLS and there's a lot of properties that sort of are through just backdoor channels of people who are networked together. Certainly, investors are that way as well as developers.
