[00:01:30] This is Real Geeks.
[00:01:32] Business, wealth and health with Aaron Helle.
[00:01:35] And we are jumping into episode four, sharing your value proposition.
[00:01:40] So in our last segment, we created a value proposition.
[00:01:44] I challenged you to create your own value proposition.
[00:01:47] If you haven't already done that, don't worry about it.
[00:01:50] It's not too late.
[00:01:52] The episode is recorded.
[00:01:53] Go back and watch it.
[00:01:55] And you can figure out how to create your own value proposition.
[00:02:01] And there's a cool little PDF download that goes along with it.
[00:02:04] And it's step by step instructions.
[00:02:05] You literally just fill in the blank.
[00:02:07] But you need to schedule some time where you can do some deep work, not distracted work.
[00:02:13] So you can actually do this.
[00:02:14] So check it out.
[00:02:16] But let's recap what we talked about.
[00:02:18] A real estate value proposition is a statement that allows an agent to communicate what value
[00:02:24] they can bring to clients and customers.
[00:02:27] This should focus on what the agent can do for their clients.
[00:02:30] How customers can benefit from them and why customers should choose the agent over other
[00:02:36] agents.
[00:02:38] In the last episode, we walked you through this step by step to create your agent mission
[00:02:43] statement and highlight your value proposition based on three things.
[00:02:47] What you can do for your clients, how your clients can benefit from your services and expertise,
[00:02:53] and why customers should choose you.
[00:02:57] So this is just a guideline.
[00:02:59] Feel free to fudge it a little bit, finagle it.
[00:03:02] Make it yours.
[00:03:04] Make it personal.
[00:03:05] There's no hard and fast rules here.
[00:03:07] You want to make it meaningful to you and make it easy for you to communicate this to
[00:03:12] your clients and potential clients.
[00:03:16] I encourage you actually to not just follow this, but make something that's a little bit
[00:03:22] more you and make it authentic and make it real to you.
[00:03:27] So spend some time doing that.
[00:03:30] So once you're done with your value proposition and your mission statement, you've got to figure
[00:03:34] out what to do with it.
[00:03:35] So that's what this episode is about.
[00:03:38] What we're going to do with our value proposition or sharing our value proposition.
[00:03:43] So, we'll first talk about practical ways that you can use your value prop.
[00:03:48] Okay, first, I want you to print it out and I want you to put it on your bathroom mirror.
[00:03:53] I want you to put it next to your desk.
[00:03:55] I want you to put it in your car wherever you're spending a lot of time so that you can
[00:04:00] look at it constantly and have it in front of your face all the time and be reminded of
[00:04:05] what it is that you offer to your clients in this space.
[00:04:10] I also want you to put it in your wallet, have a little print out if you're ever like
[00:04:14] in a meeting and you forgot a little bit, have it with you.
[00:04:17] Be able to reference it.
[00:04:18] That's totally fine.
[00:04:20] People will not judge you for that.
[00:04:21] They'll probably actually appreciate you for that.
[00:04:24] You can also use it for social media content.
[00:04:27] You can use it for like every day posts or even reels.
[00:04:32] You can create still graphics.
[00:04:34] You can create a bunch of graphics and make them into a real.
[00:04:38] You can write a blog post using that same exact copy, the same exact information.
[00:04:44] You can just reuse it in another form so that more eyes get on it.
[00:04:49] You can put it in email campaigns.
[00:04:51] You can put it in your signature block.
[00:04:53] I think you should actually make sort of a tagline from your value proposition and put
[00:04:58] that into your signature block.
[00:04:59] Everyone that you send an email to knows who you are, what you stand for, and what value
[00:05:05] that you bring.
[00:05:06] That's a really cool thing you can do.
[00:05:08] You can then take your signature block and make a business card out of it if you don't
[00:05:11] have a business card.
[00:05:13] Hopefully you're getting this idea here that you can reuse a lot of this content, which
[00:05:19] is just a system that you're creating.
[00:05:20] We'll talk about that a little bit more in later episodes.
[00:05:25] Don't feel like this is just something that you work on and you hope it sticks and you
[00:05:29] move away from this is something that you're going to use.
[00:05:31] It's going to ground you and it's going to create a foundation for you every single day.
[00:05:36] It will also allow you to do these practical things you have to do in your business like
[00:05:40] social media posts or maybe you do YouTube videos.
[00:05:42] You can do an entire YouTube video and your value proposition.
[00:05:46] You can do another YouTube video on your process to figuring out your value proposition.
[00:05:52] You can do another video, an or a blog post or an email on now that you have your value
[00:05:59] proposition, how are you putting it out there to the world and how are you communicating
[00:06:03] it?
[00:06:04] It's a ton of content.
[00:06:05] That's like a month's worth of content right there, guys, just by doing this work.
[00:06:09] I also want you to go into your social media and change your bios to reflect your value
[00:06:16] proposition.
[00:06:17] Make sure it's very clear when someone looks at you on Instagram and looks at your bio,
[00:06:21] they see who you are and what you stand for right then and they're in black and white.
[00:06:24] No questions.
[00:06:25] They know exactly what value you can bring them.
[00:06:29] You're also going to put this on any invitations.
[00:06:32] If you host like a meet up, maybe you host a coffee or a Christmas party, something like
[00:06:36] that, put it on there, put your tagline, put your value prop right on there, put it on
[00:06:41] your open house fires, literally, guys, put it everywhere.
[00:06:47] I also want you to think about adding it to your Christmas card.
[00:06:50] Maybe you do Christmas cards to your entire database.
[00:06:54] Maybe you do like twice a year cards, put it in there, put it at the end in your signature
[00:06:58] or make it a part of your card, make it a part of what you're sharing with them.
[00:07:04] When you create your business or when you create your email, you can talk about what's going
[00:07:09] on with you, what's going on in your business, give them a little update and say, oh, by the
[00:07:12] way, just to remind you, this is who I am, this is what I do, this is what I can do for
[00:07:16] you and just keep it in front of them all the time.
[00:07:20] Put it on your thank you notes that you send to your clients after closings and also be
[00:07:25] sure that you're asking for referrals when you do.
[00:07:30] You want to have this ready all the time.
[00:07:34] It needs to be right up in the front of your brain so that next time somebody asks you
[00:07:39] what you do and said, oh, I'm a REALTOR, tell them what you just came up with for your
[00:07:45] mission statement.
[00:07:46] Someone says, here's my example.
[00:07:48] Someone says, what is it that you do?
[00:07:50] I say, oh, well, I empower and coach experience agents to build life changing businesses by
[00:07:56] introducing them to the tools, coaching, and network need and to be successful.
[00:08:00] That's my mission statement, right?
[00:08:01] It sounds a little bit nerdy.
[00:08:03] It definitely sounds rehearsed.
[00:08:06] This is where you have to practice a little bit.
[00:08:08] We all do script work and stuff like that.
[00:08:10] This is similar to that.
[00:08:11] You don't want it to sound scripted though, which I guess is the point of script work.
[00:08:15] It's pretty similar.
[00:08:16] So, change it up a little bit so that it sounds a little more conversational.
[00:08:21] So watch me turn my mission statement that I just read to you.
[00:08:25] I'll reiterate it.
[00:08:25] My mission statement is to empower and coach experience agents to build life changing businesses
[00:08:30] by introducing them to the tools, coaching, and networking needed to be successful.
[00:08:36] So I'm not going to say that every time somebody asks me what I do.
[00:08:40] This is how I would have this conversation.
[00:08:42] Okay, so let's make it a little bit more conversational.
[00:08:44] So when someone says, what is it that you do?
[00:08:48] I'm going to say, I empower and coach experience agents to build life changing businesses.
[00:08:54] And they're going to say, cool, usually, how?
[00:08:57] A lot of times that doesn't mean a lot to them, especially if they're not in this space.
[00:09:01] So that's me how.
[00:09:02] And that's what I'm going to say.
[00:09:04] I introduce them to the tools, coaching, and the network they need to be successful.
[00:09:08] See how you can turn that very, like, wordy mission statement into something a lot more conversational.
[00:09:13] That's what I want you to do.
[00:09:15] I want you to practice that.
[00:09:16] Practice that with your best friend.
[00:09:18] Practice it with your spouse.
[00:09:19] People in your office practice it so that it rolls right off your tongue.
[00:09:24] And it feels good.
[00:09:25] And it sounds like you believe in it.
[00:09:26] Because if you don't believe in it, no one that's hearing it is going to believe in it either.
[00:09:33] And everything you've done will be a waste of time.
[00:09:35] So this is when your mission statement, your value proposition needs to be so real,
[00:09:40] so authentic, so you and so important.
[00:09:44] So that when you relay it to people, they understand how big of a deal it is.
[00:09:49] Okay.
[00:09:51] So just get comfortable here.
[00:09:53] And if you still, after you make it really conversational and you feel like people are telling
[00:09:58] you it's good, it's good.
[00:09:59] You're still feeling uncomfortable.
[00:10:00] I just challenge you to get comfortable being uncomfortable.
[00:10:04] Push yourself outside of your comfort zone a little bit.
[00:10:07] And just remember that if this doesn't light your soul on fire, you probably did it wrong.
[00:10:13] Or maybe you're just too scared to share it.
[00:10:16] And that might mean that you need to make a decision.
[00:10:19] Maybe you need to decide that this is not the career for you.
[00:10:22] Or maybe this isn't the strategy for you or the focus for you.
[00:10:25] Or you can just accept that you're going to be mediocre.
[00:10:28] But I don't think you want to be listening to this podcast.
[00:10:31] I don't think you're going to be doing this work if mediocre is okay with you.
[00:10:35] So if it sounds corny, it doesn't feel right.
[00:10:37] It doesn't let you up.
[00:10:39] Like give you goosebumps.
[00:10:41] Go back to the drawing board and repeat this over again until you feel that.
[00:10:45] Okay.
[00:10:45] You need to feel this value in your soul so that your clients can feel that same value.
[00:10:52] Okay.
[00:10:53] So and I'm telling you right now, like once you live this out, it's not going to feel
[00:10:57] corny anymore.
[00:10:58] So maybe you do need to fake it until you make it a little bit.
[00:11:01] But it won't feel corny once this becomes your life.
[00:11:03] So it's going to feel real.
[00:11:05] And even if it isn't real yet, just go through this process and make this a reality.
[00:11:11] And eventually it will become very real for you.
[00:11:14] Okay.
[00:11:15] So those are all the practical things that we can do with our value proposition.
[00:11:19] Let's go look at strategically.
[00:11:21] So strategically your mission statement should direct each and every decision you make
[00:11:26] about your business.
[00:11:28] Everything that you do should be rooted in this.
[00:11:31] This is your very foundation.
[00:11:32] This is the framework of your business.
[00:11:36] And this also should probably more importantly help you decide the things that you're not
[00:11:40] going to do.
[00:11:41] Okay.
[00:11:42] So your mission, your vision is going to help you at.
[00:11:48] It's going to be the basis for all of your actions, all of your decisions, who you surround
[00:11:55] yourself with.
[00:11:56] What events you attend, what meetings you go to.
[00:12:00] You have the luxury of choosing meetings can also be a burden and we get to do that as
[00:12:06] REALTORS.
[00:12:07] But time is money.
[00:12:08] So every meeting that you go to needs to be driving you to make money and it needs to
[00:12:13] be rooted in your mission statement and help you to increase your value proposition.
[00:12:17] So think about that before you go to the next meeting.
[00:12:20] Ask yourself, is this in alignment with my vision?
[00:12:23] Does this align with my mission statement?
[00:12:25] If the answer is no, don't go to the meeting.
[00:12:27] Okay.
[00:12:28] This will also decide what trainings you go to.
[00:12:30] Make sure your trainings are based on what it is that you are working on.
[00:12:35] It all needs to be rooted in your mission.
[00:12:38] So know that your values separate you from your competition.
[00:12:42] Okay.
[00:12:43] This is how you're going to separate yourself from all the other agents out there.
[00:12:46] It's going to help you attract the best talent and clients and set expectations of how
[00:12:51] you conduct business.
[00:12:53] It's also not something that you adhere to sometimes or when it's convenience or you
[00:12:58] just do it one time.
[00:12:59] This is something you need to do every single time, no matter what.
[00:13:03] It needs to be so deeply ingrained that there's no question how you're going to act in any
[00:13:09] given situation.
[00:13:10] No question for you, no question for your network and your clients.
[00:13:13] So think of your mission as the destination and your values as your Compass.
[00:13:17] If you're not using them, there's absolutely no telling where you're going to end up.
[00:13:23] So let this ground you and provide a foundation for everything you do.
[00:13:27] And most importantly, use this as your reason to say no and stay focused.
[00:13:32] Turn down the opportunities and do opportunities and air quotes, right?
[00:13:36] So not all opportunities.
[00:13:38] They don't align with your vision.
[00:13:39] If they don't align with your mission, it's not an opportunity for you.
[00:13:43] Let someone else take it.
[00:13:44] Stay focused on your goals.
[00:13:46] Okay.
[00:13:46] If you think it's hard to do, just think of these things as exactly that.
[00:13:49] Distractions.
[00:13:51] They're preventing you from taking good care of your core clients and running the business
[00:13:55] that you want to run.
[00:13:59] Okay.
[00:13:59] So remember, I am all about goals, action and results.
[00:14:03] So use up the goals.
[00:14:04] I'll give you the action and together we'll achieve exceptional results.
[00:14:08] So the action step at this point after you create your value proposition is to live
[00:14:13] out to your value proposition.
[00:14:15] Make it a part of you, something you can spew in your sleep, put it in your bios, share
[00:14:21] it all over social media, on your business card, signature block, etc.
[00:14:24] And start using it as your Compass.
[00:14:27] Allow your value proposition and your mission statements to guide your calendar management,
[00:14:32] your data activities, your responses to clients and teammates and all of your marketing.
[00:14:38] And remember to use the handout in the show notes and feel free to share with me what
[00:14:42] you came up with.
[00:14:42] Simply email erin.m.helle at gmail.com.
[00:14:46] That's all for now.
[00:14:47] I really look forward to hearing from you.
[00:14:49] I hope you send me your value propositions.
[00:14:51] I'm Erin Helle and this was the Grow With Me segment with a focus on business, wealth
[00:14:55] and help.
[00:14:56] I'm a dream builder, team leader and financially free REALTOR who wants to help you achieve
[00:14:59] all your goals.
[00:15:00] Bye guys.

They know exactly what value you can bring them. You're also going to put this on any invitations. If you host like a meet up, maybe you host a coffee or a Christmas party, something like that, put it on there, put your tagline, put your value prop right on there, put it on your open house fires, literally, guys, put it everywhere. I also want you to think about adding it to your Christmas card. Maybe you do Christmas cards to your entire database. Maybe you do like twice a year cards, put it in there, put it at the end in your signature or make it a part of your card, make it a part of what you're sharing with them. When you create your business or when you create your email, you can talk about what's going on with you, what's going on in your business, give them a little update and say, oh, by the way, just to remind you, this is who I am, this is what I do, this is what I can do for you and just keep it in front of them all the time. Put it on your thank you notes that you send to your clients after closings and also be sure that you're asking for referrals when you do. You want to have this ready all the time. It needs to be right up in the front of your brain so that next time somebody asks you what you do and said, oh, I'm a REALTOR, tell them what you just came up with for your mission statement. Someone says, here's my example. Someone says, what is it that you do? I say, oh, well, I empower and coach experience agents to build life changing businesses by introducing them to the tools, coaching, and network need and to be successful. That's my mission statement, right? It sounds a little bit nerdy. It definitely sounds rehearsed. This is where you have to practice a little bit. We all do script work and stuff like that. This is similar to that. You don't want it to sound scripted though, which I guess is the point of script work. It's pretty similar. So, change it up a little bit so that it sounds a little more conversational. So watch me turn my mission statement that I just read to you. I'll reiterate it. My mission statement is to empower and coach experience agents to build life changing businesses by introducing them to the tools, coaching, and networking needed to be successful. So I'm not going to say that every time somebody asks me what I do. This is how I would have this conversation. Okay, so let's make it a little bit more conversational. So when someone says, what is it that you do? I'm going to say, I empower and coach experience agents to build life changing businesses. And they're going to say, cool, usually, how? A lot of times that doesn't mean a lot to them, especially if they're not in this space. So that's me how. And that's what I'm going to say. I introduce them to the tools, coaching, and the network they need to be successful. See how you can turn that very, like, wordy mission statement into something a lot more conversational. That's what I want you to do. I want you to practice that. Practice that with your best friend. Practice it with your spouse. People in your office practice it so that it rolls right off your tongue. And it feels good. And it sounds like you believe in it. Because if you don't believe in it, no one that's hearing it is going to believe in it either. And everything you've done will be a waste of time. So this is when your mission statement, your value proposition needs to be so real, so authentic, so you and so important. So that when you relay it to people, they understand how big of a deal it is. Okay. So just get comfortable here. And if you still, after you make it really conversational and you feel like people are telling you it's good, it's good. You're still feeling uncomfortable. I just challenge you to get comfortable being uncomfortable. Push yourself outside of your comfort zone a little bit. And just remember that if this doesn't light your soul on fire, you probably did it wrong. Or maybe you're just too scared to share it. And that might mean that you need to make a decision. Maybe you need to decide that this is not the career for you. Or maybe this isn't the strategy for you or the focus for you. Or you can just accept that you're going to be mediocre. But I don't think you want to be listening to this podcast. I don't think you're going to be doing this work if mediocre is okay with you. So if it sounds corny, it doesn't feel right. It doesn't let you up. Like give you goosebumps. Go back to the drawing board and repeat this over again until you feel that. Okay. You need to feel this value in your soul so that your clients can feel that same value. Okay. So and I'm telling you right now, like once you live this out, it's not going to feel corny anymore. So maybe you do need to fake it until you make it a little bit. But it won't feel corny once this becomes your life. So it's going to feel real. And even if it isn't real yet, just go through this process and make this a reality. And eventually it will become very real for you. Okay. So those are all the practical things that we can do with our value proposition. Let's go look at strategically. So strategically your mission statement should direct each and every decision you make about your business. Everything that you do should be rooted in this. This is your very foundation. This is the framework of your business. And this also should probably more importantly help you decide the things that you're not going to do. Okay. So your mission, your vision is going to help you at. It's going to be the basis for all of your actions, all of your decisions, who you surround yourself with. What events you attend, what meetings you go to. You have the luxury of choosing meetings can also be a burden and we get to do that as REALTORS. But time is money. So every meeting that you go to needs to be driving you to make money and it needs to be rooted in your mission statement and help you to increase your value proposition. So think about that before you go to the next meeting. Ask yourself, is this in alignment with my vision? Does this align with my mission statement? If the answer is no, don't go to the meeting. Okay. This will also decide what trainings you go to. Make sure your trainings are based on what it is that you are working on. It all needs to be rooted in your mission. So know that your values separate you from your competition. Okay. This is how you're going to separate yourself from all the other agents out there. It's going to help you attract the best talent and clients and set expectations of how you conduct business. It's also not something that you adhere to sometimes or when it's convenience or you just do it one time. This is something you need to do every single time, no matter what. It needs to be so deeply ingrained that there's no question how you're going to act in any given situation. No question for you, no question for your network and your clients. So think of your mission as the destination and your values as your Compass. If you're not using them, there's absolutely no telling where you're going to end up. So let this ground you and provide a foundation for everything you do. And most importantly, use this as your reason to say no and stay focused. Turn down the opportunities and do opportunities and air quotes, right? So not all opportunities. They don't align with your vision. If they don't align with your mission, it's not an opportunity for you. Let someone else take it. Stay focused on your goals. Okay. If you think it's hard to do, just think of these things as exactly that. Distractions. They're preventing you from taking good care of your core clients and running the business that you want to run. Okay. So remember, I am all about goals, action and results. So use up the goals. I'll give you the action and together we'll achieve exceptional results. So the action step at this point after you create your value proposition is to live out to your value proposition. Make it a part of you, something you can spew in your sleep, put it in your bios, share it all over social media, on your business card, signature block, etc. And start using it as your Compass. Allow your value proposition and your mission statements to guide your calendar management, your data activities, your responses to clients and teammates and all of your marketing.
