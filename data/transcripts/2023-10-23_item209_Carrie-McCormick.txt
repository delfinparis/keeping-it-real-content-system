[00:03:16] Thank you.
[00:03:17] Thank you.
[00:03:18] And I'm just trying to think how long have I been on your show?
[00:03:21] Five or six, well, ever since the beginning.
[00:03:23] So I think it's been at least five year, I think six years.

[00:03:28] So thank you for having me.

[00:03:46] your episodes in particular because you are so well respected and regarded in Chicago
[00:03:53] and, you know, of course, elsewhere.
[00:03:55] But it is, it is always fun, you know, because we don't, I don't do so many Chicago episodes
[00:04:00] anymore.
[00:04:01] And so it's nice to, when I run into people, they're like, oh my gosh, I can't believe
[00:04:05] you have carry on the show every, every month like you're, you're very much looked
[00:04:08] up to in this industry.
[00:04:09] So what would you like to talk about today?
[00:04:13] Well, we're in the fall market here in Chicago and, you know, we're in Q3 and I feel like
[00:04:19] negotiations on deals have been changing a little bit.
[00:04:24] So, you know, there's all different types of negotiation strategies.
[00:04:28] And as everyone knows, each deal is different.
[00:04:32] We have a lot of different personalities in the deal, you know, the sellers, the buyers,
[00:04:38] the brokers, getting, obviously, are involved.
[00:04:41] Families sometimes get involved.
[00:04:44] So there's just a lot of personalities.
[00:04:46] And I just wanted to share some tips that I have and that have been successful for me
[00:04:53] in negotiating and creating a win-win for both.
[00:04:56] I mean, I think that's a common term that people say is, you know, everyone feels like
[00:04:59] they want to win or both sides are upset.
[00:05:01] You know, you've got a great negotiation going.
[00:05:04] But you know, there's ways to strategize and get to the finish line.
[00:05:08] So I thought it'd be helpful to share what I know.
[00:05:12] And the first one is to figure out what the other side wants and what drives them to be
[00:05:21] making these decisions.
[00:05:23] So in our industry, obviously, it's buying and selling a home.
[00:05:26] So think about your first showing with the person.
[00:05:30] That's your time to really interact with that buyer or the seller and the broker to ask questions.
[00:05:37] Obviously, we're there to sell the home.
[00:05:39] But throughout that process, you know, we can ask questions that are about, you know,
[00:05:44] where do you live?
[00:05:45] Where are you currently living now?
[00:05:46] Would you not like about your house?
[00:05:48] Is it too small?
[00:05:48] Is it too big?
[00:05:49] And obviously, don't ask the way I'm asking them now.
[00:05:52] But, you know, you learn about their family.
[00:05:54] You learn if they're renting.
[00:05:56] This is going to help formulate if they are to make an offer on your listing is now
[00:06:02] you've got a little bit of background on them, right?
[00:06:05] And again, it's not a, it's about leveraging your position.
[00:06:08] But it's also the point of it is figuring out what they want and what drives them, right?
[00:06:13] So if they're renting, or again, if they're in a house in the neighborhood and they're
[00:06:18] having an old and schools are important to them, they really want to play room.
[00:06:23] You know, again, asking the right questions is going to lead to understanding your position
[00:06:28] when it's negotiating.
[00:06:30] And you learn what's personally important to them, right?
[00:06:34] I also think it's a good idea to not only understand what the buyers or sellers want,
[00:06:40] but also you're in front of their representative, their broker.
[00:06:45] So, you know, learn a little bit about that broker.
[00:06:47] What's their negotiating style like?
[00:06:49] What is their track record?
[00:06:50] Have they sold in the neighborhood?
[00:06:51] Do they understand the cups?
[00:06:54] You know, maybe that broker doesn't really know the Lincoln Park single family home market.
[00:07:00] You know, so you can be an advocate to them and say, Hey, listen, I know that you've
[00:07:03] been sold a lot of homes in Lincoln Park.
[00:07:05] So I went ahead and I prepared the CMA for you, Mr.
[00:07:09] Broker.
[00:07:10] You know, this might help just kind of show you what the last six months have looked like here.
[00:07:16] Wow.
[00:07:17] So I just want to pause for a second because that is a very, very interesting.
[00:07:20] I'm curious.
[00:07:20] So basically you have a buyer and you're bringing them to a listing and then you can do
[00:07:27] some due diligence on the listing agent and you can actually see if they've sold homes via
[00:07:32] the MLS in that market before if you don't recognize the name or if it's somebody that
[00:07:37] hasn't doesn't have a track record, you then will reach out and say, Hey, I know you may be
[00:07:42] new to this area or, or, you know, not as familiar with it.
[00:07:45] Here's some information that might help you.
[00:07:48] And is that usually well received because I could see agents getting offended at that,
[00:07:53] but I guess it's all in how you present it.
[00:07:55] It's the delivery of the information, right?
[00:07:58] You know, and yes, I'm sure some people would get offended by that, but it's not in a,
[00:08:04] it's just more of an educational, but I really don't go that route unless I know my clients
[00:08:09] interested in the home.
[00:08:10] You know, I'm not going to go do do all that due diligence, but you know, and again,
[00:08:15] you, the showing process is kind of like an interview process, right?
[00:08:20] Because especially if I'm with a buyer and well, let me just reverse it.
[00:08:23] I've had buyers come into my listing and they're very difficult, right?
[00:08:28] They just, they rip apart the home like, Oh, my God, look at the way that this looks.
[00:08:31] This person isn't taking care of the home and you can just tell with the personality,
[00:08:36] you know, they don't like it or, you know, they're not, they're, they're going to be difficult
[00:08:40] or, you know, so you just kind of need to observe and understand, you know, what is the
[00:08:46] buyer?
[00:08:46] Maybe the buyer wants to gut the kitchen, you know?
[00:08:48] So I know now that when they come in with an offer, it's going to be lower because they
[00:08:53] need a factor in their costs.
[00:08:55] So again, during the showing process, of course, our job is to sell the home and highlight
[00:09:00] everything, but be observant, ask the right questions.
[00:09:04] So if that person was to make an offer on your home, you do have a little more information
[00:09:09] of what's important to them, what drives them and how to successfully get to a reasonable,
[00:09:17] you know, price when they make the offer.
[00:09:20] The other one is, which I think is very important, I, I'm primarily what we call sellers broker.
[00:09:25] I represent sellers, right?
[00:09:27] So understanding what my leverage is, right?
[00:09:30] So if I have a listing that's on a wide lot, modern finishes, in a great school district
[00:09:37] and there is nothing else on the market like that in Lincoln Park, I'm just making up
[00:09:42] a story.
[00:09:43] I know what my leverage is in this market, right?
[00:09:46] So when I'm there presenting the home, again, I can point out all of these facts and my
[00:09:53] cost per square foot, you know, the age of the home, the attributes that my home has,
[00:09:58] that no other home has it.
[00:10:00] If my home has everything every other home has, I'm not going to bring it up.
[00:10:04] I don't have any leverage because there's 10 other homes in the market that have the sub zero
[00:10:09] fridge.
[00:10:10] Right?
[00:10:11] But if my home is the only home that has X, I am definitely going to make sure I point
[00:10:16] that out and point it out that I am the only home that has X, that's my leverage, right?
[00:10:23] So again, understanding what that buyer wants and then knowing what my leverage points
[00:10:29] are, make sure that I highlight those during my showing.
[00:10:32] And these are all very done, obviously professionally and in good spirit, but again, the underlying
[00:10:39] message is preparing for that negotiation and preparing to get this, the household.
[00:10:46] The other one I wanted to mention is, I love this one, is agree on the, when you get
[00:10:52] an offer, agree on the easy stuff at the beginning.
[00:10:56] And what I mean by that, obviously price is always going to be the contentious point
[00:11:00] of a negotiation, but agree on the small stuff, whether it's a closing date, not that
[00:11:07] that small stuff, but you know, a closing date or their pre approval letter or I don't
[00:11:13] know, whatever it is, if they're small stuff that they're negotiating, just agree on
[00:11:18] that stuff.
[00:11:18] It just sets the tone for a nice negotiation.
[00:11:22] Two examples that I just had recently is we were kind of in this standoff of $100,000
[00:11:29] apart on a deal.
[00:11:33] I'm on the seller side, you know, the natural thing is to meet in the middle, right?
[00:11:37] And that's kind of everyone's, oh, just let's meet in the middle, win, win.
[00:11:40] And so I prepped my seller for that.
[00:11:42] I said, listen, we're $100,000 apart on a multi-million dollar deal.
[00:11:46] It's peanuts at this point.
[00:11:48] The buyer's going to come back and split the difference, right?
[00:11:51] And he's like, oh, okay, a typical negotiation, right?
[00:11:54] The buyer came back with $60,000 instead of splitting the difference.
[00:12:00] And the broker said, we're doing this to show good faith that we're a good buyer and
[00:12:07] we want to get it done.
[00:12:09] And I thought, what a great move he just made.
[00:12:11] Smart.
[00:12:13] You know, it was $10,000, but what that did was my seller was so happy with this buyer
[00:12:19] and said, let's take it.
[00:12:21] I mean, it was done, sealed and delivered.
[00:12:25] Now we're going to go into negotiations of inspection items.
[00:12:29] Well, what did that seller just, or the buyer just do?
[00:12:31] Sorry.
[00:12:32] He set himself up that if anything comes up in negotiations, my seller now thinks he's
[00:12:37] $10,000 ahead of that split in the middle thing, he may give into it.
[00:12:42] But anyways, I just thought it was a big deal.
[00:12:43] Oh, that's even, I didn't think about that.
[00:12:45] That's great as well.
[00:12:47] 
[00:12:48] That guy's listening.
[00:12:51] 
[00:12:52] Another thing that just happened, which I also thought was brilliant, which came for me.
[00:12:57] So I have to take credit for my brilliant is I did a showing and the client fell in love
[00:13:03] with a chair, loved this chair.
[00:13:06] You know, and so when they made the offer right out the gate, we said, you know, thank you
[00:13:11] for the offer.
[00:13:12] You know, we understand how much you love that chair.
[00:13:15] We just want to give you the chair.
[00:13:17] If you get, if you buy the house, we want to give you the chair.
[00:13:19] Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:20] And the buyer was so happy.
[00:13:22] And we set that tone of that negotiation in a good spirit.
[00:13:28] The buyer was so thought that was so thoughtful.
[00:13:31] The broker came back to me and says, okay, now what do you guys want?
[00:13:34] And I said, nothing, we don't want anything.
[00:13:37] I mean, obviously we're going to negotiate, but that was just a good gesture.
[00:13:40] My client knew how much you guys love that chair.
[00:13:43] They're not, it's not going to fit into their new home.
[00:13:45] If we come to an agreement, no strings attached, we want you to have the chair.
[00:13:50] And that really requires you as the listing agent paying attention to the buyer and noticing,
[00:13:56] ooh, there's something we could maybe we could do something for them because it's
[00:14:00] probably not that common that somebody walked a buyer walks in and goes, oh my God,
[00:14:04] I got to have that chair because they're obviously thinking, you know,
[00:14:08] they're going to probably replace all the stuff that's movable anyway.
[00:14:11] But I guess when you hear that, that's an opportunity for you to come back because
[00:14:15] people get so emotionally tied to things.
[00:14:17] And yeah, and that is a great way, especially furniture.
[00:14:22] I mean, furniture is a thing we just get, we get really excited about when we see a piece
[00:14:26] that really is like that would look cool in my place.
[00:14:30] So that's a great, those are two unbelievably great suggestions.
[00:14:34] But it's operating from a place of goodwill, right?
[00:14:37] So, and understanding again in the beginning of a negotiation, you know,
[00:14:41] what is your purpose?
[00:14:42] What is your leverage?
[00:14:43] What the buyer wants?
[00:14:45] What the seller wants?
[00:14:46] And you can convey all of that and be strategic.
[00:14:50] And of course, at the end of the day, you know, you want to get the,
[00:14:52] we're fiduciaries to recline.
[00:14:54] We want to get, you know, the best deal possible.
[00:14:56] But there's ways to kind of maneuver that where everyone comes out of the
[00:15:00] negotiation, feeling good about it.
[00:15:03] And that's what we want.
[00:15:04] We want everyone to feel like they want.
[00:15:08] And do you often, if you don't maybe often, if you don't know what the other
[00:15:13] side wants, I guess this is where good relationships come in where you could
[00:15:17] talk to the, to the, you know, the buyers broker and have those conversations of,
[00:15:22] yes, okay, we'll go, we'll negotiate the price.
[00:15:24] But what are there any little things that we can agree upon now to get them out
[00:15:28] of the way?
[00:15:29] I love that.
[00:15:30] Yeah.
[00:15:30] No, it's easy.
[00:15:31] And my last tip to you, this one I say exercise with caution, with severe caution
[00:15:38] is sometimes we need to put the decision makers in a room together,
[00:15:42] not physically, but maybe sometimes over the phone.
[00:15:45] I have done it in the past physically, which worked out really well,
[00:15:48] but you do have to be careful.
[00:15:50] And when I say the decision makers, I mean the buyers and the sellers,
[00:15:53] because sometimes the agents, you know, there's a lot on tag, right,
[00:15:57] that happens through the negotiation process.
[00:16:01] Sometimes there's a lot of things that get misinterpreted based on an
[00:16:05] email tone or text tone or voice mail tone or whatever it is.
[00:16:09] So I've had some negotiations that I've just put the buyer and seller together
[00:16:15] with us present, of course, on a phone call together.
[00:16:20] And like I said, I've had them face to face as well.
[00:16:24] Sometimes when you have the decision makers together, you have a very successful
[00:16:30] outcome.
[00:16:30] I'd say every time I've done it, I've had a very successful outcome where,
[00:16:34] you know, like their friends now.
[00:16:36] And it just, especially when you're dealing with certain personalities,
[00:16:41] it does work, but you, that's where you have to know your client and you have to
[00:16:44] understand and know the, know if it's a good idea.
[00:16:48] So that's why I say exercise with caution.
[00:16:50] But if you feel you're at a point with good personalities,
[00:16:55] you can be done, you know, getting the decision makers in the room.
[00:17:00] It's a great idea because we humans are wired for connection.
[00:17:04] And so we're wired to get along mostly.
[00:17:07] So when you get two people who are in kind of an adversarial position, you
[00:17:10] know, competing against each other, negotiating against each other,
[00:17:13] and you're able to bring them into a room and it's not a contentious environment,
[00:17:17] hopefully, then they actually, like you said, they actually bond closer together.
[00:17:21] They, they end up probably liking each other a little bit more at least than they did before.
[00:17:26] And they end up wanting to work together and get the deal closed.
[00:17:29] So I think those are all, wow, this is a great episode.
[00:17:32] Let's cap it there because those were, those were three amazing things and
[00:17:35] carries got it.
[00:17:36] But more.
[00:17:37] Go ahead.
[00:17:38] Oh, you do.
[00:17:38] Okay.
[00:17:39] Well, that's enough because we'll save it.
[00:17:42] We'll save other things for next episodes.
[00:17:45] And boy, that those are three amazing tips.
[00:17:47] So great negotiation tips there for our audience.
[00:17:51] Please consider using that carry uses these herself.
[00:17:54] And she is incredibly successful.
[00:17:56] So it would be who've everyone to consider implementing some of these into their
[00:18:00] process and please a couple of things too.
[00:18:03] Please remember to follow carry on Instagram.
[00:18:06] So you can find her at carry McCormick real estate.
[00:18:09] We'll have a link to that in the show notes or websites carry McCormick are

And I'm just trying to think how long have I been on your show? Five or six, well, ever since the beginning. So I think it's been at least five year, I think six years. I just, I think back to the beginning. So thank you for having me. And I love being part of it and sharing my knowledge and listening to all of your guests as well. I think it's a great community to be part of. So thank you. Well, whenever I run into you're welcome and thank you. And whenever I run into agents here locally in the Chicago land market, they always reference your episodes in particular because you are so well respected and regarded in Chicago and, you know, of course, elsewhere. But it is, it is always fun, you know, because we don't, I don't do so many Chicago episodes anymore. And so it's nice to, when I run into people, they're like, oh my gosh, I can't believe you have carry on the show every, every month like you're, you're very much looked up to in this industry. So what would you like to talk about today? Well, we're in the fall market here in Chicago and, you know, we're in Q3 and I feel like negotiations on deals have been changing a little bit. So, you know, there's all different types of negotiation strategies. And as everyone knows, each deal is different. We have a lot of different personalities in the deal, you know, the sellers, the buyers, the brokers, getting, obviously, are involved. Families sometimes get involved. So there's just a lot of personalities. And I just wanted to share some tips that I have and that have been successful for me in negotiating and creating a win-win for both. I mean, I think that's a common term that people say is, you know, everyone feels like they want to win or both sides are upset. You know, you've got a great negotiation going. But you know, there's ways to strategize and get to the finish line. So I thought it'd be helpful to share what I know. And the first one is to figure out what the other side wants and what drives them to be making these decisions. So in our industry, obviously, it's buying and selling a home. So think about your first showing with the person. That's your time to really interact with that buyer or the seller and the broker to ask questions. Obviously, we're there to sell the home. But throughout that process, you know, we can ask questions that are about, you know, where do you live? Where are you currently living now? Would you not like about your house? Is it too small? Is it too big? And obviously, don't ask the way I'm asking them now. But, you know, you learn about their family. You learn if they're renting. This is going to help formulate if they are to make an offer on your listing is now you've got a little bit of background on them, right? And again, it's not a, it's about leveraging your position. But it's also the point of it is figuring out what they want and what drives them, right? So if they're renting, or again, if they're in a house in the neighborhood and they're having an old and schools are important to them, they really want to play room. You know, again, asking the right questions is going to lead to understanding your position when it's negotiating. And you learn what's personally important to them, right? I also think it's a good idea to not only understand what the buyers or sellers want, but also you're in front of their representative, their broker. So, you know, learn a little bit about that broker. What's their negotiating style like? What is their track record? Have they sold in the neighborhood? Do they understand the cups? You know, maybe that broker doesn't really know the Lincoln Park single family home market. You know, so you can be an advocate to them and say, Hey, listen, I know that you've been sold a lot of homes in Lincoln Park. So I went ahead and I prepared the CMA for you, Mr. Broker. You know, this might help just kind of show you what the last six months have looked like here. Wow. So I just want to pause for a second because that is a very, very interesting. I'm curious. So basically you have a buyer and you're bringing them to a listing and then you can do some due diligence on the listing agent and you can actually see if they've sold homes via the MLS in that market before if you don't recognize the name or if it's somebody that hasn't doesn't have a track record, you then will reach out and say, Hey, I know you may be new to this area or, or, you know, not as familiar with it. Here's some information that might help you. And is that usually well received because I could see agents getting offended at that, but I guess it's all in how you present it. It's the delivery of the information, right? You know, and yes, I'm sure some people would get offended by that, but it's not in a, it's just more of an educational, but I really don't go that route unless I know my clients interested in the home. You know, I'm not going to go do do all that due diligence, but you know, and again, you, the showing process is kind of like an interview process, right? Because especially if I'm with a buyer and well, let me just reverse it. I've had buyers come into my listing and they're very difficult, right? They just, they rip apart the home like, Oh, my God, look at the way that this looks. This person isn't taking care of the home and you can just tell with the personality, you know, they don't like it or, you know, they're not, they're, they're going to be difficult or, you know, so you just kind of need to observe and understand, you know, what is the buyer? Maybe the buyer wants to gut the kitchen, you know? So I know now that when they come in with an offer, it's going to be lower because they need a factor in their costs. So again, during the showing process, of course, our job is to sell the home and highlight everything, but be observant, ask the right questions. So if that person was to make an offer on your home, you do have a little more information of what's important to them, what drives them and how to successfully get to a reasonable, you know, price when they make the offer. The other one is, which I think is very important, I, I'm primarily what we call sellers broker. I represent sellers, right? So understanding what my leverage is, right? So if I have a listing that's on a wide lot, modern finishes, in a great school district and there is nothing else on the market like that in Lincoln Park, I'm just making up a story. I know what my leverage is in this market, right? So when I'm there presenting the home, again, I can point out all of these facts and my cost per square foot, you know, the age of the home, the attributes that my home has, that no other home has it. If my home has everything every other home has, I'm not going to bring it up. I don't have any leverage because there's 10 other homes in the market that have the sub zero fridge. Right? But if my home is the only home that has X, I am definitely going to make sure I point that out and point it out that I am the only home that has X, that's my leverage, right? So again, understanding what that buyer wants and then knowing what my leverage points are, make sure that I highlight those during my showing. And these are all very done, obviously professionally and in good spirit, but again, the underlying message is preparing for that negotiation and preparing to get this, the household. The other one I wanted to mention is, I love this one, is agree on the, when you get an offer, agree on the easy stuff at the beginning. And what I mean by that, obviously price is always going to be the contentious point of a negotiation, but agree on the small stuff, whether it's a closing date, not that that small stuff, but you know, a closing date or their pre approval letter or I don't know, whatever it is, if they're small stuff that they're negotiating, just agree on that stuff. It just sets the tone for a nice negotiation. Two examples that I just had recently is we were kind of in this standoff of $100,000 apart on a deal. I'm on the seller side, you know, the natural thing is to meet in the middle, right? And that's kind of everyone's, oh, just let's meet in the middle, win, win. And so I prepped my seller for that. I said, listen, we're $100,000 apart on a multi-million dollar deal. It's peanuts at this point. The buyer's going to come back and split the difference, right? And he's like, oh, okay, a typical negotiation, right? The buyer came back with $60,000 instead of splitting the difference. And the broker said, we're doing this to show good faith that we're a good buyer and we want to get it done. And I thought, what a great move he just made. Smart. You know, it was $10,000, but what that did was my seller was so happy with this buyer and said, let's take it. I mean, it was done, sealed and delivered. Now we're going to go into negotiations of inspection items. Well, what did that seller just, or the buyer just do? Sorry. He set himself up that if anything comes up in negotiations, my seller now thinks he's $10,000 ahead of that split in the middle thing, he may give into it. But anyways, I just thought it was a big deal. Oh, that's even, I didn't think about that. That's great as well. That guy's listening. Another thing that just happened, which I also thought was brilliant, which came for me. So I have to take credit for my brilliant is I did a showing and the client fell in love with a chair, loved this chair. You know, and so when they made the offer right out the gate, we said, you know, thank you for the offer. You know, we understand how much you love that chair. We just want to give you the chair. If you get, if you buy the house, we want to give you the chair. Yeah, yeah. And the buyer was so happy. And we set that tone of that negotiation in a good spirit. The buyer was so thought that was so thoughtful. The broker came back to me and says, okay, now what do you guys want? And I said, nothing, we don't want anything. I mean, obviously we're going to negotiate, but that was just a good gesture. My client knew how much you guys love that chair. They're not, it's not going to fit into their new home. If we come to an agreement, no strings attached, we want you to have the chair. And that really requires you as the listing agent paying attention to the buyer and noticing, ooh, there's something we could maybe we could do something for them because it's probably not that common that somebody walked a buyer walks in and goes, oh my God, I got to have that chair because they're obviously thinking, you know, they're going to probably replace all the stuff that's movable anyway. But I guess when you hear that, that's an opportunity for you to come back because people get so emotionally tied to things. And yeah, and that is a great way, especially furniture. I mean, furniture is a thing we just get, we get really excited about when we see a piece that really is like that would look cool in my place. So that's a great, those are two unbelievably great suggestions. But it's operating from a place of goodwill, right? So, and understanding again in the beginning of a negotiation, you know, what is your purpose? What is your leverage? What the buyer wants? What the seller wants? And you can convey all of that and be strategic. And of course, at the end of the day, you know, you want to get the, we're fiduciaries to recline. We want to get, you know, the best deal possible. But there's ways to kind of maneuver that where everyone comes out of the negotiation, feeling good about it. And that's what we want. We want everyone to feel like they want. And do you often, if you don't maybe often, if you don't know what the other side wants, I guess this is where good relationships come in where you could talk to the, to the, you know, the buyers broker and have those conversations of, yes, okay, we'll go, we'll negotiate the price. But what are there any little things that we can agree upon now to get them out of the way? I love that. Yeah. No, it's easy. And my last tip to you, this one I say exercise with caution, with severe caution is sometimes we need to put the decision makers in a room together, not physically, but maybe sometimes over the phone. I have done it in the past physically, which worked out really well, but you do have to be careful. And when I say the decision makers, I mean the buyers and the sellers, because sometimes the agents, you know, there's a lot on tag, right, that happens through the negotiation process. Sometimes there's a lot of things that get misinterpreted based on an email tone or text tone or voice mail tone or whatever it is. So I've had some negotiations that I've just put the buyer and seller together with us present, of course, on a phone call together. And like I said, I've had them face to face as well. Sometimes when you have the decision makers together, you have a very successful outcome. I'd say every time I've done it, I've had a very successful outcome where, you know, like their friends now. And it just, especially when you're dealing with certain personalities, it does work, but you, that's where you have to know your client and you have to understand and know the, know if it's a good idea. So that's why I say exercise with caution. But if you feel you're at a point with good personalities, you can be done, you know, getting the decision makers in the room. It's a great idea because we humans are wired for connection. And so we're wired to get along mostly. So when you get two people who are in kind of an adversarial position, you know, competing against each other, negotiating against each other, and you're able to bring them into a room and it's not a contentious environment, hopefully, then they actually, like you said, they actually bond closer together. They, they end up probably liking each other a little bit more at least than they did before. And they end up wanting to work together and get the deal closed. So I think those are all, wow, this is a great episode. Let's cap it there because those were, those were three amazing things and carries got it. But more. Go ahead. Oh, you do. Okay. Well, that's enough because we'll save it. We'll save other things for next episodes. And boy, that those are three amazing tips. So great negotiation tips there for our audience.
