[00:01:24] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage, your team?
[00:01:28] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:32] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:35] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:37] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:41] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:46] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:52] to leave you?
[00:01:53] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents.

[00:02:07] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:11] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:16] read everything I offer.
[00:02:17] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agents
[00:02:23] needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:25] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:27] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.

[00:02:58] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate
[00:03:03] agents and four real estate agents.
[00:03:05] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:06] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:08] If you are new here, welcome.
[00:03:09] And if you're returning, welcome back.
[00:03:10] We appreciate you as always.
[00:03:12] Tell a friend about this show.
[00:03:13] That's how we grow and we can keep doing more episodes, the more people you tell.
[00:03:17] There's always real estate agents that want to learn from people that we're going to be
[00:03:20] interviewing like the guy today, Jay Known.
[00:03:22] He is a 40 year veteran expert.
[00:03:25] Top 1% producer.
[00:03:26] This guy just has lots of wisdom.
[00:03:29] He is sharing it today.
[00:03:31] It was one of my favorite conversations I've ever had.
[00:03:33] He's a warm person.
[00:03:35] Really truly take a listen to his mindset, his integrity, his compassion, his empathy.
[00:03:40] And it really comes through and it's the right way to run a business and grow a business.
[00:03:45] And you can learn a lot from Jay.
[00:03:46] So I'm super excited to share him with you in just a moment.
[00:03:49] I also have a little gift for everybody.
[00:03:51] So I want you to try this out.
[00:03:53] I just built this and I'm getting amazing feedback on it.
[00:03:55] It's my gift to you.
[00:03:57] It's totally free to use.
[00:03:58] I want you to go to listing.joincail.com.
[00:04:01] I built, I vibe coded, which is a term I didn't ever thought I'd say, but I vibe coded
[00:04:05] an app that has been really helpful for agents, at least the ones that have tested have
[00:04:09] given me feedback on.
[00:04:10] So listing.joincail.com.
[00:04:13] It's a listing rewriters for you.
[00:04:14] I know the problem I was here to solve was people were telling me if I throw my listing
[00:04:19] description into chat GPT, I was getting great results, right?
[00:04:23] It was getting kind of this standard rewrite that seemed similar to other people that were
[00:04:28] using it on the MLS.
[00:04:29] And like everybody's listings kind of look the same with the same verbiage and the same
[00:04:33] kind of AI tells.
[00:04:35] And it just didn't really stick out.
[00:04:36] So I wanted to create a much better way to do that.
[00:04:39] So I did.
[00:04:40] And now when you throw in your listing description, I'm going to rewrite it for you or our AI
[00:04:43] is six different times before it sends it back to you.
[00:04:46] And it comes from all these different perspectives like what is what would a journalist write?
[00:04:50] What would an advertising exact right?
[00:04:52] What would a person who writes movie trailers for action movies right?
[00:04:56] Things like that.
[00:04:57] And we're going to then have it kind of mashed together and give you a final output with
[00:05:00] three variations.
[00:05:01] It's going to email it to you.
[00:05:02] It's totally like I said, free to use.
[00:05:04] I just want to get your feedback.
[00:05:05] So give it a shot.
[00:05:06] You just throw in an existing listing description.
[00:05:08] Give me the address of the property as well and a little bit of info just in case it doesn't
[00:05:12] have it in the listing description because I'm going to then also look in the surrounding
[00:05:16] area and see, did you miss something?
[00:05:19] Are there amenities or are there parks or schools or anything cool nearby that you should
[00:05:24] be mentioning in there, but you didn't.
[00:05:25] And I'm also going to look at the previous listings for that property and say, did you miss
[00:05:30] something from a previous listing?
[00:05:32] Like did you miss a feature that you didn't know about?
[00:05:34] And we're going to add that in as well.
[00:05:36] And it's really, really cool.
[00:05:37] So please give a shot.
[00:05:38] I'm super excited about it.
[00:05:39] Like I said, again, it's free.
[00:05:41] Maybe one day I'll charge for it.
[00:05:42] But for now, it's free.
[00:05:44] Listing.joincail.com and let me know what you think.
[00:05:46] All right, let me get on to it.
[00:05:47] My conversation with Jake Anum.
[00:06:05] Best advice you've perceived in real estate.
[00:06:09] Show up.
[00:06:10] Do the work.
[00:06:12] Be straight with your clients.
[00:06:15] And success will be inevitable.
[00:06:20] I like that.
[00:06:21] Show up and do the work.
[00:06:23] Showing up is a good chunk of it, isn't it?
[00:06:26] It's a huge chunk of it.
[00:06:29] And then I was, that's inevitable.
[00:06:32] Worcett Vice.
[00:06:34] Worcett Vice.
[00:06:37] Don't spend money on marketing.
[00:06:40] Just get out there and doorknock and make your cold calls.
[00:06:44] Why was that bad advice?
[00:06:47] Well, because marketing has brought me to where I am today.
[00:06:53] I mean, marketing is attracting.
[00:06:57] Selling is convincing.
[00:06:58] So when you're doing those cold calls,
[00:07:00] and you're doing those doorknockings,
[00:07:01] I mean, don't get me wrong.
[00:07:02] I did my business like that for 15 years.
[00:07:05] That's how I started in the business.
[00:07:06] That's how I grew.
[00:07:07] But you really get burnt out after a while,
[00:07:10] do business that way.
[00:07:11] I mean, you know, you're in the office at 8 o'clock in the morning
[00:07:13] and then you're there till 10 o'clock in the night.
[00:07:14] You're just cold calling or maybe taking off
[00:07:17] for a few hours during the day and banging on doors.
[00:07:19] And I have to do that for a while.
[00:07:22] I mean, it gets away.
[00:07:23] Where's on you?
[00:07:24] So when I kind of took my business from a marketing
[00:07:27] from a selling business, which is what I call that part of business,
[00:07:30] into more of a marketing business,
[00:07:33] that's when the calls people started coming to me.
[00:07:37] Yeah, attraction.
[00:07:40] Exactly, exactly.
[00:07:42] It wasn't a get rich quick scheme.
[00:07:43] I mean, that's something that takes time.
[00:07:45] It takes time, but it'll pay off.
[00:07:48] Jake Canone is my guest today.
[00:07:51] He is with William Raevis in Fairfield County, Connecticut.
[00:07:54] They are luxury broker in a very wonderful, beautiful part
[00:07:59] of our country.
[00:08:00] I'm going to tell you more about Jay.
[00:08:02] He has been in real estate.
[00:08:03] He is a really a legend in real estate 40 years.
[00:08:07] And through Booms, Busts and Battles,
[00:08:09] many agents haven't experienced, but Jay has.
[00:08:12] He has raised four kids and built a business entirely from scratch.
[00:08:17] He carried his family, his pain, his pressure,
[00:08:20] while still showing up with professionalism and tenacity
[00:08:23] throughout these 40 years.
[00:08:25] His son struggled with addiction for 13 years,
[00:08:28] and sadly, they lost them in 2020,
[00:08:31] but Jay has been through hell, but he is kept going,
[00:08:34] not just because he had to,
[00:08:35] but because he made a commitment to helping others win.
[00:08:38] And even when life gets hard,
[00:08:40] Jay understands real struggle,
[00:08:42] and he fights for his clients like their his own family.
[00:08:46] He has been nationally recognized.
[00:08:48] He has spoken at National Association of REALTORS.
[00:08:51] He's been in the National REALTORS magazine.
[00:08:52] He was actually, you were quoted or actually talked about
[00:08:58] in a very important book called,
[00:09:01] Grill of Marketing by Jay Levinson, by the way,
[00:09:03] that this is, Jay is a very, very big deal.
[00:09:05] He is all about trust-based reputation,
[00:09:08] built through constant personal branding
[00:09:11] and just being an authentic good human being.
[00:09:15] I want everybody to follow Jay at his Instagram account,
[00:09:18] which is Jay Canone, underscore real estate.
[00:09:20] We'll have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:09:22] Jay, what a wonderful pleasure it is to have you on the show.
[00:09:25] Welcome.
[00:09:26] Well, thank you, DJ.
[00:09:27] I appreciate that introduction.
[00:09:28] I don't feel like I'm that important,
[00:09:29] but thank you so much.
[00:09:31] Well, that's what everybody who's important says.
[00:09:34] They go, oh, I'm not that big of the deal.
[00:09:37] And, yeah, well, I think your track record is so impressive.
[00:09:43] I've looked into it and I know what a big deal you are.
[00:09:46] And I know that this is a job of carry wood,
[00:09:52] or sorry, carry water, chop wood every single day.
[00:09:55] It is rinse and repeat.
[00:09:57] It is doing the hard things that you have done
[00:09:59] for your clients for all this time.
[00:10:01] But I want to start at the beginning of the story
[00:10:03] and then let's get to kind of where we are today
[00:10:06] because you've been doing this for decades.
[00:10:09] Tell us how you got into real estate.
[00:10:10] Gosh, I got to remember back now.
[00:10:13] So no, no, actually my dad, my dad was in the real estate
[00:10:16] business.
[00:10:17] My father was a co-owner of a pretty large real estate company
[00:10:20] right here in Fairfield County.
[00:10:24] And I always admired my father.
[00:10:27] I always liked the lifestyle that he led.
[00:10:30] I always appreciated the facts.
[00:10:32] I mean, as I got a little bit older,
[00:10:33] I mean, I always appreciated the facts
[00:10:35] that he was always at our ball games.
[00:10:37] He always sat with the family for dinner.
[00:10:39] It was a really good father.
[00:10:40] You know, when I admired his job, I admired what he did.
[00:10:44] And I admired the respect that he had and people gave him.
[00:10:48] And I always said that I wanted to do a dad
[00:10:50] and I wanted to do what my father did.
[00:10:53] So it's funny, DJ, because I went off to college.
[00:10:57] After graduating high school, obviously, I was 18 years old.
[00:10:59] I went off to college for one year.
[00:11:01] I went to Northeastern University in Boston.
[00:11:04] And every time I would call home, you know,
[00:11:07] my father would, you know, I'd be like,
[00:11:08] hey, pop, how you doing?
[00:11:09] My dad said, hey, how you doing, Janet?
[00:11:11] Goody, I just got out of math class.
[00:11:12] Just got out of history class.
[00:11:14] And you know, my father would say, well, you know,
[00:11:16] that's good.
[00:11:16] We just opened up another office today
[00:11:18] or I just bought another Ferrari or I just bought a,
[00:11:21] I just got back from another trip from,
[00:11:23] I'm like, what am I doing in college?
[00:11:26] I got to get into the family business.
[00:11:30] So that was, I should have finished college.
[00:11:33] Number one, that was, I should have finished college,
[00:11:35] but I ended up leaving college.
[00:11:37] And I got into the business.
[00:11:38] And my mom and dad did not want me to leave college.
[00:11:40] They begged me to stay, but I was really convinced
[00:11:42] that I could do real estate.
[00:11:43] I was 19.
[00:11:47] So my mother and father were just kind of like,
[00:11:48] all right, you know what, let them get into the business.
[00:11:50] Let them try it.
[00:11:51] And probably about six months,
[00:11:52] they'll be begging to get back to college
[00:11:54] and get back to those buddies and party again.
[00:11:59] So it was like October of 1984,
[00:12:01] is when I actually started the right page of 19.
[00:12:05] And you know, back then DJ, you don't know it,
[00:12:08] but back then, all I knew was I had to find people
[00:12:12] that had to buy and sell.
[00:12:13] I mean, that's all that I knew.
[00:12:15] And you know, I never watched my dad do a listing presentation.
[00:12:18] I never watched any of that stuff.
[00:12:19] My father put me out into one of his offices
[00:12:21] and I had a manager, his name is John.
[00:12:24] And if it wasn't for John, I probably still would,
[00:12:26] I would not be here today to be honest with you
[00:12:28] because he really took me under his wing
[00:12:29] and really gave me some special attention.
[00:12:31] And it was amazing.
[00:12:32] He was a tremendous mentor.
[00:12:34] And I tell him that every time I see him.
[00:12:38] And you know, I mean, that year, I sold 49 houses
[00:12:42] when I was 19.
[00:12:44] 19.
[00:12:46] It was my mom and dad said, I guess he's not going back to school.
[00:12:50] I mean, who gives a 19 year old a home to sell?
[00:12:54] That's amazing.
[00:12:55] But I used that to my advantage.
[00:12:57] I always used my age to my advantage saying
[00:12:59] that I wanted to make this my career.
[00:13:00] And I was going to work 15 times harder.
[00:13:02] Yeah.
[00:13:04] To make it my career.
[00:13:06] And people just, they bought into it.
[00:13:07] And it was the rest was history.
[00:13:09] It was amazing.
[00:13:11] It was, I mean, back then, DJ too, don't forget.
[00:13:14] I mean, I'd get into the office and say seven o'clock
[00:13:16] in the morning.
[00:13:17] I was the first one in the office.
[00:13:18] And back then we had newspapers.
[00:13:20] And you know, inside the newspaper,
[00:13:21] it would say, you know, all the four sale by owners
[00:13:24] would be in the newspaper.
[00:13:25] And you know, people that got job promotions
[00:13:27] were in the newspaper, birth announcements were in the newspaper.
[00:13:32] Everything you want to know, people that are renting apartments,
[00:13:34] people that were, everything was in the newspapers.
[00:13:36] So I would literally go through the newspaper
[00:13:37] and call every single person in there.
[00:13:39] Sure.
[00:13:39] Congratulations.
[00:13:40] Congratulations on their new job promotion.
[00:13:42] Now you're making more money.
[00:13:43] You want a bigger house or congratulations on your new baby.
[00:13:46] Maybe you need an extra bedroom.
[00:13:47] I mean, so it was, it was a lot of fun.
[00:13:49] You know, like I said, get up and, you know,
[00:13:51] right in the middle of the day and just go out and put a backpack
[00:13:53] with some brochures on my back or some business card.
[00:13:55] Just go knocking on doors all day.
[00:13:57] And I mean, what a great way to start the day.
[00:14:00] You're basically just spreading joy
[00:14:02] and congratulating people on these accomplishments,
[00:14:04] life, life achievements.
[00:14:07] I mean, if you think about it,
[00:14:07] it's, there's, there's worse calls to make, right?
[00:14:11] Like you could have been selling something else
[00:14:14] that wouldn't have been that kind of phone call, right?
[00:14:17] You would have been the kind of call that people
[00:14:19] want to slam the phone number.
[00:14:20] And you're calling going, oh my God,
[00:14:21] I just saw that you had a baby.
[00:14:23] Congratulations, right?
[00:14:24] That is a, that is a very warm, warm introduction.
[00:14:28] And I'm sure not every call of course leads to a sale,
[00:14:31] but it is at least very flattering
[00:14:33] and complimentary phone call.
[00:14:36] I like to make all my phone calls even to this day that way.
[00:14:39] I always try to make an uplifting happy,
[00:14:42] you know, congratulatory phone call.
[00:14:44] But yeah, you're right.
[00:14:45] It was, it was a cool way.
[00:14:46] It was, but you know, listen,
[00:14:47] and after doing that for five or 10 years,
[00:14:49] you know, it gets, it gets to, where's on you?
[00:14:51] Sure.
[00:14:52] It was on you.
[00:14:53] I mean, my son, Cross, got his license about three years ago.
[00:14:58] And, you know, he, it was, it was difficult,
[00:15:01] you know, hearing all those knows for him.
[00:15:03] And having all those people slam the phone down on him.
[00:15:06] And, you know, it gets, it, it wears on you.
[00:15:08] And not it, but listen, man, you,
[00:15:09] if you're in this real estate business,
[00:15:11] you've got to have thick skin.
[00:15:13] You've got to be disciplined.
[00:15:14] You've got to have some thick skin
[00:15:15] and just say, you know what,
[00:15:16] if someone slams the phone down,
[00:15:20] next, and not even think about it, it's over.
[00:15:23] It was funny.
[00:15:25] Back in the day, there was a guy by the name of,
[00:15:27] his name was Tom Hopkins.
[00:15:28] I don't know if you're,
[00:15:28] Oh, sure.
[00:15:30] I don't know.
[00:15:30] He had a funny face to go to the seminars
[00:15:33] back in the day, back in the 80s,
[00:15:35] but he had something really funny.
[00:15:36] He said, you know,
[00:15:37] think about how much your commission is.
[00:15:39] Let's say it was $1,000, you know,
[00:15:41] and how many calls that it make you
[00:15:42] or take you to get that $1,000 sale?
[00:15:45] So break it down.
[00:15:46] How much was every phone call worth, you know?
[00:15:49] $20, $20 is a phone call.
[00:15:51] So when somebody would start swearing at me
[00:15:52] on the telephone and raiding,
[00:15:54] I'd say, listen, thank you for the 20.
[00:15:56] It's a good way to look at it.
[00:15:58] Well, it's all about,
[00:16:00] it's not attitude in mindset, right?
[00:16:01] And that's exactly it, right?
[00:16:03] Like you, you're absolutely right.
[00:16:05] It's not fun to get those phone calls.
[00:16:06] Nobody wants to be rejected.
[00:16:08] Nobody wants to be sworn at.
[00:16:09] And yet, every call is another call closer to the deal.
[00:16:14] And of course, it is technically you are making money.
[00:16:17] If you think about it, as long as you keep going
[00:16:19] because you are going to get the closer to the,
[00:16:22] yes, you're getting absolutely on a percent.
[00:16:23] My dad and I did decide to open up a real estate company in 1989.
[00:16:27] So we opened up a real estate company in 1989.
[00:16:30] We called it John Cannon real estate and I worked with my father.
[00:16:33] And we were literally side by side for, oh gosh, until 1996.
[00:16:40] And working with your parents was not always very easy.
[00:16:44] And I always said, I always said to myself,
[00:16:45] I said, you know, pop, I love you.
[00:16:47] I said, I'll see you on Sunday for dinner.
[00:16:50] But I got a goal because either you're going to kill me
[00:16:52] or I'm going to kill you, but one of us are going to die.
[00:16:54] I got to go.
[00:16:55] My father had those really old school mentalities
[00:16:58] and those are the grindstone.
[00:17:00] And I was kind of getting more into the marketing way of business.
[00:17:03] We just had a different philosophies.
[00:17:05] And if I had a tremendous amount of respect for my father,
[00:17:07] he gave me a lot of knowledge.
[00:17:10] But my dad's gone.
[00:17:13] He passed away about maybe like three or four years ago.
[00:17:16] My dad ended up going back.
[00:17:19] Grumped, he lost everything he had.
[00:17:21] Had a very bad, so I mean, I'm telling you,
[00:17:23] it wasn't all roses here for me.
[00:17:25] It wasn't, you know, I didn't hear it.
[00:17:26] The big business.
[00:17:26] I got into the business because of my parents, my dad,
[00:17:30] but here I am 40 years later and I'm still selling the business.
[00:17:33] I love the business.
[00:17:35] I mean, I'm still working the business.
[00:17:36] I love it.
[00:17:37] But yeah, it's amazing.
[00:17:40] You have definitely had your share of struggle.
[00:17:44] And I love that you're so earnest about some of the challenges of life.
[00:17:49] And I admire that.
[00:17:50] I honor you for that.
[00:17:52] I think it takes tremendous courage to share that.
[00:17:55] And really,
[00:17:58] show me the perfect person with the perfect life.
[00:18:01] Everyone's got them.
[00:18:02] Very few people are willing to talk about it.
[00:18:05] And I hope that hopefully what I say can help somebody, maybe, you know, I,
[00:18:10] I hope so because I, I can feel it in you.
[00:18:13] You have an authenticity.
[00:18:14] You have a, a need to connect.
[00:18:18] And I suspect your clients feel that from you.
[00:18:22] You probably have, I mean, you know,
[00:18:24] I was looking when I was doing my research on you.
[00:18:27] It's like, oh, Jay is like the mayor, and he's not the mayor, of course,
[00:18:31] but not technically the mayor, but he is a very well-known person in his town.
[00:18:35] He's foreign and raised there.
[00:18:36] He's been there for his entire life.
[00:18:38] He's service the community.
[00:18:40] He obviously sells in the community and he is in the community.
[00:18:44] And he is a very important person within Trumbull.
[00:18:47] And that is your town.
[00:18:49] And I am just, it is just amazing to see what you've built.
[00:18:53] But it hasn't been easy, right?
[00:18:55] Yeah, it's been a lot of hard work and a lot of setbacks.
[00:18:57] And of course, everybody's life has them.
[00:19:01] Most people aren't willing to share.
[00:19:03] And I, I, I, I, I deal with what makes the man how you deal with them and how you
[00:19:07] continue to move forward.
[00:19:09] That's, that's what it's all about in life.
[00:19:11] It's moving forward, continuing to move forward.
[00:19:13] Yeah, I was, I find that too.
[00:19:16] I was listening to someone else talk about this recently that we've made our lives.
[00:19:20] Someone else was talking and saying, we've been our lives very resistance free, right?
[00:19:26] We have so much convenience in our life.
[00:19:28] And that's good.
[00:19:29] That's good.
[00:19:30] But it, it, it's a problem in a way because if we don't have challenge, we don't
[00:19:35] learn.
[00:19:36] We, we don't learn how to become stronger.
[00:19:38] So you almost have to in this day and age because we're so technologically advanced.
[00:19:43] We have so many amenities.
[00:19:45] Obviously in this country, we're, we're so blessed to all the, you know, all the things
[00:19:48] that we have here.
[00:19:49] But you almost have to put your own obstacles in the path if you don't have them
[00:19:54] already because, you know, it's the only way we can grow and learn and get stronger.
[00:19:58] And, you know, you don't even have to go out and get groceries anymore.
[00:20:01] You can just have those delivered to you.
[00:20:03] Yeah, I didn't expect that.
[00:20:04] Yeah.
[00:20:05] Yeah.
[00:20:05] And so, you know, it's, it is, it is impressive, you know, what, what you've been through.
[00:20:10] And I appreciate you sharing some of those stories.
[00:20:13] And I'm excited to, to hear more, more from them.
[00:20:17] I want to hear a little bit about what your clients mean to you because I know you are
[00:20:22] somebody that feels things very deeply.
[00:20:24] They're important to you.
[00:20:25] And tell us a little bit about how you think about your clients.
[00:20:28] I think about my clients now, much differently than I did in the past.
[00:20:34] As I've aged, you know, when you're a 19 or a 20, my wife and I have been dating
[00:20:42] since we were 14 years old, we've been together.
[00:20:44] We got married.
[00:20:45] We were 22.
[00:20:46] We had our first son.
[00:20:48] We were 24.
[00:20:51] And my wife has never had a paying job her whole life.
[00:20:53] She's always been a home mom.
[00:20:56] So I pulled this wagon all by myself, you know?
[00:20:59] So when you're, when you're doing real estate and you're trying to raise a family and say,
[00:21:03] you've got four kids, man, you're just running.
[00:21:05] I'm running and running and running and running.
[00:21:07] And I'm just going from one deal to the next to the next to the next.
[00:21:09] Just to, just try to make ends meet just to build it.
[00:21:12] You know, and, um, but that's, this is, now this is an important thing I'm going to say right now
[00:21:19] because that, this is probably the one thing in my life that I probably regret the most.
[00:21:27] I wish I've met some amazing, amazing people along the way that were just amazing people.
[00:21:35] I mean, just people that I really connected because you know, when you're selling their
[00:21:39] house or you're working with them as a buyer or what, you just, you develop that really
[00:21:43] close relationship, you know, and, um, I just wish I, I wish I had stopped and smelled
[00:21:47] the roses, man.
[00:21:48] I wish I had talked to these people a little more and got to know them because all of a
[00:21:51] sudden before I know it, I'm just running to the next deal and I haven't spoken to these
[00:21:54] people anymore.
[00:21:55] And all of a sudden, two, three, four years goes by.
[00:21:59] So one of the words, so one of the biggest advice that I give to my son and I can give
[00:22:04] to whoever's watching this podcast right now is develop that relationship because you
[00:22:12] meet some wonderful and amazing people and really get to know him and, and, and don't,
[00:22:17] and hang on to those relationships.
[00:22:19] I mean, it'll also, it's very gratifying to you as a person, but besides that it'll obviously
[00:22:24] help you in business as well because now that those elites here referrals in the future.
[00:22:32] Um, and now that we have, you know, now, you know, we have all the social media and all
[00:22:36] these kinds of reviews and testimonials that can be seen all over the world.
[00:22:40] It's, uh, it's amazing, but that's, that's something that I, I regret and, uh, that I've
[00:22:45] actually changed quite a bit getting to know my friends.
[00:22:49] So becoming more intimate with your clients, checking in on them, letting them know that
[00:22:55] you're still, uh, invested in them after the transaction.
[00:22:58] I wish my wife and I just went out to dinner on Friday with clients of mine.
[00:23:01] I've never done that before.
[00:23:03] You know, I mean, we've been doing it the last five years or so, but, you know, we went
[00:23:07] to dinner with friends now with these people.
[00:23:09] We become friends and I, and I really look back and I, you know, some of my just pick up
[00:23:13] the phone and call it.
[00:23:14] I'm just like, Hey, what's going on?
[00:23:15] I miss you.
[00:23:15] You know, I haven't seen it.
[00:23:17] Yeah.
[00:23:17] Yeah.
[00:23:18] That's that change a lot.
[00:23:20] It's important.
[00:23:21] Let's talk about branding because I know you have a brand and, and when, when, looking
[00:23:26] when I was researching you, boy, you have a brand and it, I would say your brand is
[00:23:33] professional luxury kind.
[00:23:37] I think there's an empathy to you that is resonates in your material, uh, very,
[00:23:44] um, determined and relentless, but, uh, but, but just overall like good guy.
[00:23:50] I feel like good guy is your brand.
[00:23:53] Uh, tell me about your bread.
[00:23:54] Thank you.
[00:23:55] I appreciate that.
[00:23:56] So again, I kind of, I can't really take credit for a lot of this because it was back
[00:24:01] in 1997.
[00:24:05] Now I just, now I was with William Ravens.
[00:24:07] I had left my dad.
[00:24:07] I was with William Ravens.
[00:24:09] And it was a guy in my office and he had this business card with a logo on it.
[00:24:14] It was like a beautiful, like little beach scene, you know, with the, with the grasses
[00:24:18] and the sunset in the background.
[00:24:20] And I kind of looked at him.
[00:24:21] I was like, wow, that's a beautiful business card you have there.
[00:24:23] Where'd you get that?
[00:24:24] He wouldn't tell me.
[00:24:25] He was like, well, I'm not telling you.
[00:24:28] You know, I give away secrets.
[00:24:30] So I eventually found out from my office manager that he had worked with a company called Hobbs Herter,
[00:24:36] which at the time was a, which ended up becoming the largest real estate,
[00:24:44] advertising marketing company in the United States.
[00:24:46] Yeah.
[00:24:47] And I called the Hobbs Herter and they said, oh, we're going to be doing a seminar in New York City,
[00:24:53] in two weeks from now, why don't you show up and so my wife and I, we went, you know,
[00:24:57] and again, you know, we weren't, we were struggling.
[00:25:01] You know, I was just paying the bills and someone and so forth.
[00:25:04] And we went to the seminar and it wasn't Don Hobbs or Greg Herter that was running the seminar.
[00:25:08] I was just one of his salespeople and it was all about branding.
[00:25:11] You know, it was, it was about being the brand.
[00:25:15] Don't blend in.
[00:25:17] You know, and it was all about creating
[00:25:23] the brochure.
[00:25:24] It was about creating the story about finding out what your niche is, who's your audience going to be?
[00:25:31] You know, so I, I filled out this, I ended up buying into the system.
[00:25:35] You know, they had like systems that went from like $5,000 to $25,000.
[00:25:39] You know, if you want, you want a postcard, you want a house flyer, you want a website,
[00:25:43] you want business cards, you know, so I picked the basic, smallest packers that they had
[00:25:48] and I had my personal brochure, my business cards and my house flyer, my postcards.
[00:25:58] And I, I was really, I was really taken back by what I, what they did for me.
[00:26:07] I mean, they just, they really taught me that the brand is, is really, is everything to you.
[00:26:14] The brand is very, very important to DJ.
[00:26:18] And it was funny because I mean, when I first started, when I switched,
[00:26:22] remember I told you about the old way of doing business, the door knocking and then the new way is the marketing.
[00:26:27] But I always, I always said that, you know, when I first started with this, this, this business,
[00:26:32] I, with this marketing type of business, I, I was, I mean, I was like trying to do mail outs.
[00:26:41] I was trying to do small little advertisements in the newspaper, little black and white, you know,
[00:26:45] two by two ads in the newspaper and things and I was sending out these postcards for about 10 months.
[00:26:51] And I mean, I was literally getting nothing, nothing at all.
[00:26:54] I mean, and, and Hobbs heard the company was telling me what to put on the postcards.
[00:26:58] Who do mail the postcards to?
[00:26:59] I mean, it was a complete system they had.
[00:27:02] And I was getting no results whatsoever.
[00:27:04] And I was also stopping.
[00:27:05] I was kind of getting away from my, my business of cold calling and door knocking and I was putting everything into the,
[00:27:11] into the marketing aspect of the business.
[00:27:14] And I was on the verge of bankruptcy.
[00:27:15] I'm not kidding.
[00:27:16] I mean, I was, I was like, I was, I was on a full call with Hobbs heard of a bunch of agents from around the country one day.
[00:27:21] And everyone's like, oh, man, I'm doing it now.
[00:27:24] It's unbelievable.
[00:27:24] And I'm getting so much business and it's all the, and I'm just sitting there.
[00:27:28] I go, I got another story to tell you.
[00:27:31] I said, I've been doing this for about 10 months.
[00:27:34] And I'm on the verge of bankruptcy.
[00:27:36] I've got no phone, no calls, nothing, you know, and, and Don Hobbs was the guy who was holding
[00:27:41] the phone and he was posting, he was doing the call.
[00:27:42] And he goes, you know, Jay, sounds like you're doing everything right.
[00:27:46] He said, just hang in there for a couple more months, man, hang in there.
[00:27:49] It's something, it's going to click.
[00:27:50] I'm telling you, it's going to click.
[00:27:51] And I said, well, I'll try, I'll give it a whirl, you know, those are the days when I was in the grocery store.
[00:27:56] And I'm pushing the grocery cart and I'm writing a check at the cat, the checkout.
[00:28:00] And as I'm pushing the grocery, I'm like, I hope to God, that check clears, you know.
[00:28:03] And he has, yeah, those are some fun times.
[00:28:06] But I'll just, I'll never forget the day I, I got a phone call.
[00:28:09] It's just shortly after that.
[00:28:11] The guy was like, Jay, can you come up and listen to my house?
[00:28:15] God gave me his name.
[00:28:16] I went up to his house and he was standing at the door with my postcard in his hand.
[00:28:21] He goes, come on, let's figure out the price.
[00:28:23] And let's sign this up.
[00:28:24] And I'm like, well, he's like, listen, anybody who sends me these postcards is consistently as you've done for the past 10 months.
[00:28:30] That's who I want to work with.
[00:28:32] Yeah.
[00:28:32] And then it was almost like the faucets returned on at that point.
[00:28:36] I just started getting calls.
[00:28:38] And don't forget, Jay, at that time too, I was kind of like the pioneer in personal marketing.
[00:28:42] So they weren't getting these kind of, nobody was really getting these marketing materials in the mail back then.
[00:28:49] But, but yeah, so my business, my business went from, let's say, oh gosh, from, let's say, $3 million to almost $17 million in one year.
[00:28:58] Wow.
[00:28:59] Yeah, it was just, it was an amazing transformation.
[00:29:02] And it was all because of the marketing.
[00:29:03] So, you know, so all of a sudden, my little two by two black and white ads, maybe got to be three and three.
[00:29:08] And then all of a sudden, they got to be four by four.
[00:29:10] Then all of a sudden, they turned into color ads and, you know, my 500, you know, direct mail turned into a thousand people to 1500 to 2000 people.
[00:29:20] So as, as my business crew, I grew with it.
[00:29:23] Yeah.
[00:29:24] But the marketing was really the key.
[00:29:26] I remember I was, I'm talking.
[00:29:27] So cut me off if I whenever you want.
[00:29:29] But no, no, this is, I love it.
[00:29:31] I was at a real estate.
[00:29:32] I was at a convention, a Hobbs Herter's convention.
[00:29:36] And I was in a, I was in a buffet line.
[00:29:38] And the right in front of me was Greg Herter from Hobbs Herter.
[00:29:41] And I tapped him on the shoulder and I said, I said, Greg, hi, my name is Jay Kanone.
[00:29:45] I'm over at Fairfield County, Connecticut.
[00:29:47] And I just want to tell you, I just want to say thank you to you guys.
[00:29:50] I said because I'm, you know, my business just went from $13 million to $17 million in a year.
[00:29:55] And I was on the verge of bankruptcy.
[00:29:57] And he looked at me as though I had three heads on my shoulder.
[00:29:59] And I was like, he was like,
[00:30:01] so I went after this after after the lunch and the seminar started up again.
[00:30:05] He is like, where's Jake?
[00:30:07] Where is Jake?
[00:30:08] Is Jake in the room?
[00:30:09] And I knew he was looking for me.
[00:30:10] You know, I, I raised my hand and gave me the microphone.
[00:30:13] He's like, I go, Jay.
[00:30:15] And he said, Jay, just tell everybody what you were telling me.
[00:30:18] And you know, so I told the story.
[00:30:22] And, you know, he just, I ended up becoming their poster child.
[00:30:29] You know, I was, I ended up becoming their big thing for that company because of the success that their systems provided for me.
[00:30:37] But don't get me wrong.
[00:30:38] I mean, their systems didn't, nobody, not everybody was successful using their systems.
[00:30:43] But I really used it.
[00:30:44] I worked it, it worked really, really hard.
[00:30:45] And I was really committed to it.
[00:30:47] And I mean, you know, and there was a lot of, a lot of wonderful things started happening.
[00:30:51] You know, the more money I was making, gosh, my wife, my wife started getting nicer to me.
[00:30:55] She started becoming nicer to me.
[00:30:57] We got a bigger house.
[00:30:58] I mean, a lot of good things started happening, you know.
[00:31:01] But, um, those are some amazing times, you know, some amazing times.
[00:31:07] But that was all about the marketing and the branding.
[00:31:10] Yeah, I, it was, yeah.
[00:31:13] I'm interested in how you think about today's sort of marketing landscape.
[00:31:19] So we have social media, we have, you know, all sorts of digital ways to, to reach people.
[00:31:25] We have, still, we can send mailers, we can do the print stuff.
[00:31:30] Where do you find that you get the most bang for your buck?
[00:31:35] Yeah, DJ, I mean, if you think about it, like what is, what is our job as a, you know,
[00:31:42] marketing to me always became like, you know, I want to, I want to try to get people to like me
[00:31:47] with one before they've even met me.
[00:31:49] Because that's really what we need to do when you're marketing out there as agents,
[00:31:52] is to get people to like you because people do business with people they know like and trust.
[00:31:56] So those are the three things you're trying to get through with your marketing.
[00:32:00] Everything that I do, every piece of mail I mail out, everything I do was always geared towards that.
[00:32:05] It was always geared to let people know who I am as a person.
[00:32:09] You know, my personal brochure was, you know, three pages long and I had nothing to do with real estate.
[00:32:14] It was about me as a person and who I am.
[00:32:17] I want, I want to get people to know me and hopefully like me.
[00:32:21] Trust me.
[00:32:22] And then they do business with people that they know like and trust.
[00:32:26] So
[00:32:29] social media has just changed the game.
[00:32:31] I mean, it's just a, it's just a totally new world.
[00:32:34] I mean, it's just, gosh, if we had this back in, you know, 1990, I don't know, you know,
[00:32:39] what I would have done.
[00:32:41] But, yeah, but now I just find it as a, as networking on steroids.
[00:32:47] And it's just such an amazing way to get people to really get to know you personally intimately.
[00:32:52] To hear your voice and to get your message.
[00:32:56] And I just love it.
[00:32:57] I mean, it's also for my home sellers, it's amazing because now I'm getting 30,000 views on my home tour videos.
[00:33:06] Yeah, I mean, just, I mean, just these are things that you know, you, what separates me from the competition.
[00:33:10] I mean, listen, I'm going to get you 30,000 videos, 30,000 views on these, on these home videos.
[00:33:18] Um, it's just, it's just, I just think it's an amazing thing.
[00:33:21] I mean, some people, yeah, it's just another piece to my puzzle, but I just think it's such an important
[00:33:27] piece. And if, and so many people just don't want to take to this video, they don't want to be
[00:33:33] in front of the cameras like you and I do constantly. See, my philosophy is, who gives a shit?
[00:33:40] I mean, I, I know my stuff.
[00:33:42] I know my business.
[00:33:43] I mean, and it is what it is.
[00:33:46] And this is who I am.
[00:33:48] So I have no problem speaking on camera.
[00:33:51] I have, I actually, I have fun with it.
[00:33:53] I really do. I really enjoy it.
[00:33:55] And I don't get me wrong.
[00:33:56] You know, when I started doing videos, maybe it was six, seven years ago,
[00:33:59] they weren't as polished as they are now.
[00:34:02] You know, it was a little iPhone.
[00:34:03] It was, you know, but now I have a videographer and I do some pretty cool stuff.
[00:34:07] But listen, man, I don't, I don't need a videographer.
[00:34:09] I could still use the, the iPhone and, you know,
[00:34:13] and have a Camacho's is good.
[00:34:15] I was watching one of your client testimonials earlier today and I was impressed by just
[00:34:23] the question that was asked to the client, which is a group, such a great question.
[00:34:30] And it was a little bit nuanced.
[00:34:32] And for those of us who, you know, watched these kind of things, we might have,
[00:34:36] we might just blow past it without realizing the power of it.
[00:34:40] But they were asked, why did you choose Jay?
[00:34:43] Which I thought was interesting because I didn't seem like they knew you prior.
[00:34:47] And they said, why did you choose Jay?
[00:34:50] And they said, well, and they started to answer that question about what you had done
[00:34:55] to impress them.
[00:34:56] Why they thought you were the most competent person for the job.
[00:35:00] And they were doing the marketing for you.
[00:35:03] And, and they, I'm sure they weren't prompted.
[00:35:05] It seemed very honest and earnest.
[00:35:07] And I just thought, what a great question is why did you choose Jay?
[00:35:12] And I love that.
[00:35:13] So for all of us that haven't created videos like that, I encourage you to check those out.
[00:35:18] It's a pow, Jay does powerful testimonials.
[00:35:21] And he films them very professionally.
[00:35:23] They are, they look amazing.
[00:35:25] You don't, of course, as Jay said, you don't have to have, you know, a videographer
[00:35:29] always with you.
[00:35:30] But boy, you've captured some amazing moments with your clients.
[00:35:35] And it really, I don't go
[00:35:38] I don't go to their house either when I just send my videographer to the house.
[00:35:42] 
[00:35:43] And he has, I just give him a few questions to ask, you know, he could ask whenever he wants.
[00:35:47] But that's what, that's what comes out.
[00:35:48] I'm not even there.
[00:35:49] I don't.
[00:35:50] But, you know, I think those video testimonials are very powerful, very, very powerful.
[00:35:55] Boy, they sure are.
[00:35:56] I mean, I was impressed.
[00:35:57] I was watching them and I've seen a lot of REALTOR testimonial videos.
[00:36:01] And usually they're all very similar.
[00:36:03] Yours are not.
[00:36:04] Yours are different.
[00:36:05] And I just thought, you know, boy, that makes a lot of sense.
[00:36:09] I want to know why people choose you.
[00:36:10] I don't want to know that I should choose Jay.
[00:36:13] I want to know why people choose Jay, right?
[00:36:15] And that's a pretty unique distinction.
[00:36:17] And it sounds simple and it sounds like obvious.
[00:36:20] But if we really think about it, we're talking about branding.
[00:36:24] And your brand is consistency, authenticity, relentless work ethic,
[00:36:28] treating every client like family.
[00:36:30] And everything you put out there sort of shines through that lens.
[00:36:36] And you can hear it in your client's responses.
[00:36:40] So if everyone should check out Jay, your YouTube channel.
[00:36:43] We'll have a link to that in the show notes as well.
[00:36:45] Because you do get a lot of views on your various videos as well as you just have a lot of
[00:36:52] people in your corner.
[00:36:53] I want to talk about contribution because I know that's really significant to you and has made
[00:36:59] a big impact in your life.
[00:37:02] You've been a part of organizations for years.
[00:37:05] Talk about sort of the organizations you support and why you support them.
[00:37:13] You know, DJ, like you had mentioned in my introduction, you know,
[00:37:18] my son battled opiate addiction, you know, for, oh gosh, he was 16 years old.
[00:37:23] He passed away when he was 29.
[00:37:24] So 13 years and on December 20th, it'll be his, the fifth year anniversary of his death.
[00:37:32] But if you take the five years since he's been gone in the 13 years while he was with us,
[00:37:39] with the addiction, I was, I was still trying to function with a 75 pound weight on my shoulder,
[00:37:47] 24, 7. Because addiction is one of the worst things that I could ever wish I could
[00:37:54] wish it had anybody. It's, you know, tear people apart, tear families apart.
[00:37:59] It's a very, very difficult thing. It's, it was like living with a terrorist 24, 7.
[00:38:04] It was very scary. I miss my son terribly, but I don't miss the addiction.
[00:38:10] And, you know, my son Kyle, you know, my son John passed away when Kyle just started his first
[00:38:16] semester in law school. And he just got sworn into the party.
[00:38:21] Congratulations to the Connecticut bar. Thank you.
[00:38:25] You know, we were, we were, when I heard the past the bar, I just, I felt to the floor of my kitchen,
[00:38:30] just crying like a baby. But, um, but what was the question DJ just just remind me where
[00:38:37] I was going? Oh, just that, you know, contribution, giving back to the community.
[00:38:43] Yeah, so what I'm saying is now, now I'm, I'm really getting more involved now with my community.
[00:38:48] For example, I live in the Nicholas part of Trumbo, which is, you know,
[00:38:51] let's say our town is broken up in a certain areas. We got the Nichols section, the Daniels farm section,
[00:38:56] the Tashwood section. And, and down here in Nichols, it's, it's kind of historic. A lot of the
[00:39:00] houses are placked. And we have an NIA, which is a Nichols Improving Association. And I've,
[00:39:05] you know, a few years ago, I decided to get involved with the NIA. And, you know, now I'm the
[00:39:09] membership chairman. I, I just took on a responsibility to be the chairman for the, uh,
[00:39:15] the nominating committee for the next year's executive board. I'm going to be on as well.
[00:39:20] They're pushing me to be president, but I don't really have the time to be the president.
[00:39:23] He, the guy that we have right now, his name is Bryce. And he's amazing. He's there.
[00:39:27] He's retired. He needed a retired person to do that job. As a matter of fact, today, I mean,
[00:39:32] we have a bonfire set for December 14th. And it's a community thing. People in Nichols all
[00:39:37] gather in the park and run it up at the NIA building. And we have an amazing bonfire. I think
[00:39:42] it's probably, if you're in a space, you can probably see this thing burning from there.
[00:39:46] So I actually collected 250 pallets today. I rented a truck at Home Depot this morning,
[00:39:50] 830, me and my two boys. And we went and we picked up 250 pallets from a couple of businesses.
[00:39:57] And we took like six or seven trips and went back and forth into business and started the pile for
[00:40:01] the pallets for the bonfire. And I just get so much joy out of that, you know, now. And it was
[00:40:07] just something I felt as though I really couldn't do before. And I just never could really get involved
[00:40:12] with certain things that I was passionate about. Organizations or, or, you know, my son Cross was a
[00:40:19] wrestler. He's, my gosh, he's about 26 years old now. But he went to school in Iowa. And he won
[00:40:27] the NCAA National Title. He's an NCAA champion. He's amazing. The greatest times in my life,
[00:40:33] by the way, being out there in the Midwest watching him become the best in the country.
[00:40:39] But that was the, that was really the thing that even trying to be with him was difficult back then,
[00:40:44] you know, just because my wife needed me around the house. It was, it was real tough times. But again,
[00:40:49] getting involved with my community and my friends and people is just such a joy, it's so uplifting.
[00:40:55] And just to get back to the community and just things that you're passionate about, you know.
[00:40:59] You're a guy who I assume has a lot of structure. And I know, of course, as a REALTOR, your day
[00:41:05] probably fluctuates. It looks different from what you've structured previously. But tell us what
[00:41:11] is a normal day look like for you? Normal day for me is, you know, I'm getting up, I get up in the
[00:41:18] morning, I get up very early, I'm up up 5, 3 AM, 6 o'clock. And I usually, I usually jump into my
[00:41:24] sweatpants and I get into my car and it's dark outside and I drive to the fitness edge. You know,
[00:41:30] I drive over here to the gym. Actually, it's plant fitness. And I work out of the morning for about
[00:41:34] an hour and a half. And I do a lot of cardio. As a matter of fact, I lost 50 pounds in the past
[00:41:41] 13 months. Thank you. Actually, about 45 pounds. Yeah, it's amazing. I made a commitment and I
[00:41:49] really stopped doing it. Yeah, there was no drugs involved just diet and exercise, man. I mean,
[00:41:55] just really very, very strict. I feel great. So I've been going to the gym every day. I have a
[00:42:00] sauna inside my house. So I come home and I do a sauna. In my sauna, I do a little meditating and
[00:42:07] I just do my gratitude every day. Just like these guys like Tom Ferry and all these other fellas
[00:42:12] tell you to do. It's just a wonderful thing. I'm usually in my office by about 9 o'clock am.
[00:42:18] And I always had my day set the night before. So I'm usually banging out my phone calls in the
[00:42:24] morning. I go out and preview some houses later in the morning. I'm usually going on my
[00:42:31] list in presentations in the afternoon. Sometimes they're in the evening as well. I always take that
[00:42:37] hour for lunch and spend some time with my wife. I really enjoy being with my wife. I think she's
[00:42:44] she's been with me now for the last couple of years. I really have her involved in the real
[00:42:50] state business. Not to the point. Just being by my side. And my wife is just a beautiful person.
[00:42:57] She's a wonderful person. She's she's from down south. She was born in Kentucky. So you know,
[00:43:03] she was a nice person being from down south. Not like a parent Connecticut in New York.
[00:43:08] Yeah, everyone says she you're not from around here. Ain't no. But um, yeah, she's she's um
[00:43:15] she's my yin to the yang. Is that what they say? She's she's just so lovable that people just
[00:43:20] love her. You know, they love for who she's so genuine. You know, when I go on a listing
[00:43:25] presentation, she just comes with me to state. They just before you know it, I mean,
[00:43:29] they're just talking about gardening and they're talking about, you know, I mean,
[00:43:32] they're they're walking around looking around. It's just it's just amazing. And then I'm just,
[00:43:36] you know, I'm just very focused on the business aspect of the other appointment and we make a good
[00:43:41] team together. So she's um, she's getting a real estate license. Not because I wanted to,
[00:43:45] you know, I wanted to get a little bit more involved and maybe post-smoping houses and things
[00:43:49] like that. So just I imagine she would be very pleased to hear how you described her and how much you
[00:43:55] as enjoy her and and how much how much fun you can you can hear in your voice spending time
[00:44:02] with your wife. DJ, I tell her all the time. I tell her all the time. I like I said, you know,
[00:44:08] when my son John passed away, I got so many people that that said, you know, they they sort of
[00:44:16] calling me and writing me letters and you know texting me and all kinds of stuff and telling me how
[00:44:21] how John my son John had in fact, infected, affected their lives and how he personally touched
[00:44:27] these people. Whether it was through his music because he was amazing musician. I mean,
[00:44:31] he could play piano, play guitar. Everyone took a lesson. Just could in, you're just an amazing kid.
[00:44:39] But I after, you know, when he was gone, I kind of sat back and I said to myself,
[00:44:45] if John knew how much people cared about him and loved him and how how he influenced so many
[00:44:52] lives and how he affected people, whether it was he was a personal trainer at the gym too. I mean,
[00:44:56] it was a power lifter. It was amazing. And I said, no, I don't think it would have affected him
[00:45:05] because that's how powerful the drug is. Yeah. Because when it gets inside you it gets into your soul
[00:45:10] and nothing else matters. And it's so it's a horrible thing. But um,
[00:45:17] where was I going with this? You know, we were saying if he if he he were to know how much he touched
[00:45:25] people and and how how much they loved him. Right. And I said the answer to that would be no.
[00:45:33] But the point that I'm making is that I make it an effort right now. I make an effort to tell
[00:45:39] anybody in my life who's touched me in a positive way. How much they have touched me in a
[00:45:44] positive way and what they've meant to my life. And I tell my family that I love them every single day.
[00:45:49] I tell people that I love how much I love them. And I'm not going to wait for them to be gone
[00:45:53] before I do that. Yeah. I mean, remember I see people that have affected my life in a positive way,
[00:45:58] whether it's in a restaurant or a don't can don't wherever I am. Even a Starbucks. I'd be like,
[00:46:02] hey man, I would tell you how what you've done for my life always.
[00:46:06] I have that same philosophy. I you know, you sort of we all have an expiration date. We don't know
[00:46:12] what it is. And we don't know. Yeah. And we don't know when anyone else's last last moments are.
[00:46:20] And we don't know when ours are. And this idea that you know, don't die with your music still in
[00:46:26] you, right? Like the idea that somebody matters to you. And right now you could pick up the phone
[00:46:31] and tell them right now you could call a client that you haven't called in 10 years and say, I'm sorry,
[00:46:36] I haven't called you in 10 years. I care about you and I'm thinking about you. And I just wanted you
[00:46:41] to know that. And you know, family friends, it is it is such an easy thing to do now. We are so
[00:46:48] easily connected. And yet I find that, you know, we we often don't. And I would encourage everyone
[00:46:56] listening to think about the people that matter to them. And remember that they won't be here forever.
[00:47:02] And they might not be here tomorrow. Hopefully they will, but maybe they won't. And think about what
[00:47:07] would you want them to know before before their final moments. And this is the time to share it with
[00:47:13] them. And what what I've found by sharing that I'm curious to get your thoughts is it opens up the
[00:47:20] opportunity for the other person to also share. It's usually not just a one way conversation.
[00:47:27] The other person usually says, well, you mean a lot to me as well. And then you get to have the shared
[00:47:32] intimate moment. And it's appreciation. So I'm curious how a lot of those conversations
[00:47:38] end up going for you. Well, it's funny how you just said that because you know, I was just there
[00:47:42] was this guy named George who was very close friend of my dad. And his son his son was just
[00:47:48] diagnosed with cancer. And I called up George and I just me got a thank you for being such a good
[00:47:52] friend to my to my parents when they were around, you know, and how you're so close to my dad.
[00:47:57] And just they just thanked him for just being such a good person and good good friend of our family.
[00:48:01] And he goes, you know, I was told you're old man, you're better than he was. You're definitely better
[00:48:06] than I got a kick out of that. But you're right. How you just said, you know, by telling somebody
[00:48:11] and he turned it around and said, you know, you were a better you were a better REALTOR. Your father
[00:48:14] was nice. So listen, again, the day we all our children would be better than what we are, you know,
[00:48:19] that's really what we want. That's that's our goal in life is to have our kids do more, be more
[00:48:24] than we have. But um, but yeah. Well, I, I, you know, I want to end with, you know, if, if you were to
[00:48:36] talk to the younger you who didn't know everything that you know now, what would you say to the
[00:48:43] younger you that didn't know that back then, but that you are really clear. You know, what would
[00:48:49] you tell the younger you? Well, I mean, there's a couple of things. DJ, I mean, number one is, I mean,
[00:48:53] I want to get back to that because again, a lot of that is, you know, smelling the roses that I
[00:48:57] had talked about earlier. That's what I would definitely tell the younger me is don't just keep running.
[00:49:03] But one thing that I do now with my with my clients too, and I think this is a big, this,
[00:49:08] this really differentiates me from other agents that are out there plugging along as well too.
[00:49:15] I, when I, when I approach my home sellers, primarily home sellers, it's a team effort that I,
[00:49:22] that I bring to the table. You know, it's not just about me. It's about you, DJ, if I'm selling
[00:49:27] your house, I need you to be a part of this. You know, I want you, it's your house. You live there.
[00:49:33] You know, all about your house. You know, I want you to, you know, we're all straight down all the
[00:49:37] amenities that you enjoyed. Why you bought the house, all of your amenities. You know, let's,
[00:49:41] let's hear everything. I want you to, when I do my right up on your house, I want to email it to
[00:49:45] in the morning. I want you to critique it. I want you to proof it. You know, change it. Do you want
[00:49:49] things taken out? Do you want things added in? When I do my photography, I want you to look at all the
[00:49:53] photos. And do you want to take some photos out? Do you, do you, do you have certain photos that you
[00:49:57] like? Especially, I just, I just want it, it's a team effort. And that's something that, um,
[00:50:03] that people really appreciate a lot. And they, you know, they're also like, oh, God, I wonder what
[00:50:07] this REALTOR's going to do. I'm like, no, it's not the, it's about what we're going to do. We're a team.
[00:50:12] Yeah. We're a team. We're going to get this done together. I mean, this is a very stressful thing
[00:50:16] that you guys are going to go through right now. Yeah. It says, this is not fun. And I tell them
[00:50:21] it's not fun, man. I mean, it's a, it's a big inconvenience. And there's a lot of stress and
[00:50:27] pressure. And we're going to have some speed bumps. Yeah. There's always a speed bump. Yeah.
[00:50:30] Always speed bumps. You know, we're going to get over those. But, but at the end of the day,
[00:50:36] it's going to be a great end result. It's going to be a great end result. But we'll just take it in
[00:50:39] little steps. And we take it in those little steps. If you look at the whole picture as a, as a big
[00:50:44] picture, it could be very overwhelming. But just break it down to little steps. You know, that's
[00:50:48] the first thing we got to do. We got to get your house stage. We got to do this. We got to do that.
[00:50:51] We got to, and then we're going to get there. And then we're going to get it on the market. And
[00:50:54] then we're going to do this. Then we're going to do that. But I'll take care of all the work. I just
[00:50:57] want your help to a certain extent, you know, to a certain extent. But if I'm looking back at my,
[00:51:03] my old, old J, I would say to the old guys, I'd say, you know what? Count your blessings,
[00:51:10] your gratitude. Take better care of yourself than you do on your job because you are the motor,
[00:51:17] you are the engine that runs everything. Stay in shape. I would say, you know, be very
[00:51:27] disciplined. Always, always be looking for new and modern technology. Always be, always be a
[00:51:34] student of the game. Always be learning. Always be going to seminars. Always be learning the latest
[00:51:39] technology. Just trying to stay up on, on everything, keeping current matters and things like that.
[00:51:44] Just learning about the markets, the real estate markets, the interest rates, just, just being
[00:51:49] a knowledgeable person. I do a lot of seminars to real estate seminars. I host some restaurants.
[00:51:54] I'm just a knowledge person. I bring a team of experts with me. I wish I had done that
[00:52:01] 30 years ago. And again, being a knowledge broker, staying in contact, networking with people,
[00:52:10] staying in contact with these people that you're dealing with because God, like I tell you,
[00:52:13] you're handling one of the biggest things in their life that they'll ever have to go through.
[00:52:17] And it's stressful as all heck, you know? You've got to put yourself in their shoes too and
[00:52:22] understand what they're going through. You know, sometimes I go into a house. I mean,
[00:52:25] it's a horrible divorce. Sometimes I'll go into a house and it was just a tragic death.
[00:52:33] Sometimes it's not all that. So I deal with a lot of broken people sometimes and I've got to help.
[00:52:37] I'm helping everybody. Regardless of who they are, I've got to help. They need to get their household
[00:52:43] and you're going to get it sold for the most money I physically possibly can. And I've got to do
[00:52:47] it in the least amount of time. I've got to do it stress-free for them. I've got to make them
[00:52:51] have a wonderful experience, turn them into raving fans and make it as stress-free as possible
[00:52:57] because we all have enough stress in our lives. We don't have to add to it. I don't need to add to it.
[00:53:03] I need to help them. And that's that's the mentality that goes into everything. And that's where I
[00:53:07] would kind of tell my old self, man. The young guys get into the business and also you've got to
[00:53:11] stay disciplined. You've got to have a game plan. You've got to create a daily work habit and you've
[00:53:17] got to stick to that day. You've got to stick to it every single day because if you're consistent and
[00:53:22] you work hard, it's going to pay off. There's no doubt about it. 100 percent will pay off. This is a
[00:53:27] career. You know people are like, oh, I'm going to try real estate. I'm going to get it. No, no, this is
[00:53:31] this is a business and you got to treat it like a business. It's like opening up a restaurant
[00:53:36] without any food. If you need to spend some money sometimes on yourself, you've got to invest
[00:53:40] in yourself. You've got to build your brand. You sometimes have to put some ads out there,
[00:53:44] some Facebook ads, some Instagram ads. You've got to sometimes maybe pay a video out of the
[00:53:49] fur. Do some post direct mail or have some nice branded sign writers. You've got to do these things.
[00:53:54] You've got to write checks. It's a business. You've got to build your business. And I wish I had
[00:53:59] known that when I first started too. It took me 20 years to learn all that.
[00:54:04] Well, you certainly know it now and I was going to ask you if retirement is something on the
[00:54:11] horizon, but I would suspect you would say no because you like what you do so much. I don't
[00:54:17] see you stopping doing this until you want to. Well, that's what retirement is. DJ, what is your time
[00:54:24] to you? Well, I love what I do and my father also loved what he did and he just finally stopped
[00:54:32] at 78 because he said, I have my body's kind of telling me it's time, but he goes, but I could
[00:54:39] keep going, but maybe yeah, and but he loved it. And he was he was like, why would I stop doing
[00:54:45] what I love? And I love that he worked at 78. And I imagine he all similar. My I have no, I think
[00:54:51] I'm just getting started to be honest with you. Honest to God, I think the best years were ahead of me.
[00:54:56] And they are going to be ahead of me. This year was a record breaking year. I've done over $30
[00:55:00] million in volume. I've sold over 40 houses. It's been it has been a wonderful year. And
[00:55:07] you know, next year my goals are going to be higher. And retirement for me is is working because
[00:55:16] I want to and not because I have to. Yeah. That's what retirement is. Working because I want to
[00:55:23] and not because I have to. So make the right investments to the younger Jay who's out there right now.
[00:55:29] Make wise investments. Save your money. You don't need to buy the Porsche or the Mercedes. You can
[00:55:34] go out and buy a nice little two family house. Yeah. Live in one net for a year or so. And then
[00:55:39] rent them out and go buy another one or go. But you know, invest in real estate. You never go wrong.
[00:55:43] It's a tremendous way to retire. Because in 20 years from now, you loan 20 properties. Yeah.
[00:55:50] And half of those properties that you own will probably be mortgaged free and there just be a
[00:55:53] tremendous cash flow. Yeah. So invest in real estate. You sell it. You should be investing in it.
[00:55:59] Don't ever compete against your clients. That was one thing my dad taught me since son. Don't
[00:56:04] don't compete against your clients. Don't buy. Don't. Don't be a speculator to a certain extent.
[00:56:11] I'm not a flipper. I'll sell my I'll sell my flips to my clients. Because that's not who I am. I'm
[00:56:17] not a flipper. I'm a REALTOR. My father told me that years ago. What do you want to be son? Do you
[00:56:21] want to be a speculator? Do you want to be an event weight or do you want to be a REALTOR? What do
[00:56:24] you want to do? Because it's hard to do them well and do them well. Yeah. I wanted to be a REALTOR.
[00:56:32] So I've made other people a lot of money over the years and I find great joy in that too.
[00:56:36] But there's nothing wrong with buying a nice two family or a nice piece of property once a year
[00:56:41] if you're a young guy and you know building a little real estate empire is a wonderful thing.
[00:56:46] Well Jay, I am so grateful that you spent time with us today. You are authentic is probably not
[00:56:53] even enough of a word to describe how genuine of a person you seem to be and your clients
[00:57:02] resonate that same exact sentimentality when I watch some of these videos and I'm so grateful to
[00:57:08] have had you on the show. I've done this almost 700 times and I don't get to speak to somebody
[00:57:13] quite like you as often as I would prefer. So on behalf of the audience and I know they appreciated
[00:57:19] it because I appreciated it and we say thank you and on behalf of Jay and myself, we also say thank
[00:57:26] you to the audience to sticking around and being here all the way to the very end and listening to
[00:57:32] Jay's stories and listening to his authenticity and his advice about how to build a wonderful life
[00:57:38] and how to persevere when times get hard and they do. Always move forward. You always got to move
[00:57:44] forward but you always got it. There's going to be life's going to kick you the ass and knock you
[00:57:47] to the ground. You just got to get up brush you off and keep going. It's good. I don't know if
[00:57:52] there's a god of course but if there is that it'll be my first question when I get to meet god,
[00:57:58] I will say why did you make it so hard? I mean you can call because it was supposed to be so hard
[00:58:03] but but but but I'm afraid you also had a tremendous amount of blessings though. Absolutely and
[00:58:08] any any day above ground is a victory. Any day. Every day. No, that's a start. Yeah. Yeah and
[00:58:17] attitude mentality consistency. I hear that in your your very intentional. You are you are a
[00:58:24] serious but soft person which I love in your very authentic and what what a pleasure to have you
[00:58:31] on the show. This is the kind of people that I love to feature on this podcast on behalf of
[00:58:37] everyone. You know thank you again for our audience to our sponsors to our guest Jay and we will
[00:58:44] see everybody on our next episode. I will encourage everybody to please send this episode to another
[00:58:50] agent right. Jay has been doing this for 40 years. There's a lot of agents that are maybe feeling
[00:58:55] like I might want to get out of the business right now because times aren't aren't as easy as maybe
[00:59:00] they'd like them to be. Jay is a great example of why you. I was going to say to DJ DJ. You guys can
[00:59:07] reach out to me anytime text message or you know through Instagram and or give me a call and I'm
[00:59:12] more happy to help however I can. You know we have advice I can help you guys with. And also if
[00:59:17] you're an agent who has clients that move to Fairfield County or anyone who read Connecticut Jay
[00:59:23] would love an opportunity to connect with you and also he has clients that move out of Connecticut.
[00:59:29] So you should reach out to yourself. That's right especially if you will live in a warm climate
[00:59:35] that is that is especially right now this time of year it's starting to look a lot a lot better
[00:59:41] to go down there. And so anyway Jay thank you so much. Please everyone tell another agent about

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agents needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now onto the show. Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide and host through the show. If you are new here, welcome. And if you're returning, welcome back. We appreciate you as always. Tell a friend about this show. That's how we grow and we can keep doing more episodes, the more people you tell. There's always real estate agents that want to learn from people that we're going to be interviewing like the guy today, Jay Known. He is a 40 year veteran expert. Top 1% producer. This guy just has lots of wisdom. He is sharing it today. It was one of my favorite conversations I've ever had. He's a warm person. Really truly take a listen to his mindset, his integrity, his compassion, his empathy. And it really comes through and it's the right way to run a business and grow a business. And you can learn a lot from Jay. So I'm super excited to share him with you in just a moment. I also have a little gift for everybody. So I want you to try this out. I just built this and I'm getting amazing feedback on it. It's my gift to you. It's totally free to use. I want you to go to listing.joincail.com. I built, I vibe coded, which is a term I didn't ever thought I'd say, but I vibe coded an app that has been really helpful for agents, at least the ones that have tested have given me feedback on. So listing.joincail.com. It's a listing rewriters for you. I know the problem I was here to solve was people were telling me if I throw my listing description into chat GPT, I was getting great results, right? It was getting kind of this standard rewrite that seemed similar to other people that were using it on the MLS. And like everybody's listings kind of look the same with the same verbiage and the same kind of AI tells. And it just didn't really stick out. So I wanted to create a much better way to do that. So I did. And now when you throw in your listing description, I'm going to rewrite it for you or our AI is six different times before it sends it back to you. And it comes from all these different perspectives like what is what would a journalist write? What would an advertising exact right? What would a person who writes movie trailers for action movies right? Things like that. And we're going to then have it kind of mashed together and give you a final output with three variations. It's going to email it to you. It's totally like I said, free to use. I just want to get your feedback. So give it a shot. You just throw in an existing listing description. Give me the address of the property as well and a little bit of info just in case it doesn't have it in the listing description because I'm going to then also look in the surrounding area and see, did you miss something? Are there amenities or are there parks or schools or anything cool nearby that you should be mentioning in there, but you didn't. And I'm also going to look at the previous listings for that property and say, did you miss something from a previous listing? Like did you miss a feature that you didn't know about? And we're going to add that in as well. And it's really, really cool. So please give a shot. I'm super excited about it. Like I said, again, it's free. Maybe one day I'll charge for it. But for now, it's free. Listing.joincail.com and let me know what you think. All right, let me get on to it. My conversation with Jake Anum. Best advice you've perceived in real estate. Show up. Do the work. Be straight with your clients. And success will be inevitable. I like that. Show up and do the work. Showing up is a good chunk of it, isn't it? It's a huge chunk of it. And then I was, that's inevitable. Worcett Vice. Worcett Vice. Don't spend money on marketing. Just get out there and doorknock and make your cold calls. Why was that bad advice? Well, because marketing has brought me to where I am today. I mean, marketing is attracting. Selling is convincing. So when you're doing those cold calls, and you're doing those doorknockings, I mean, don't get me wrong. I did my business like that for 15 years. That's how I started in the business. That's how I grew. But you really get burnt out after a while, do business that way. I mean, you know, you're in the office at 8 o'clock in the morning and then you're there till 10 o'clock in the night. You're just cold calling or maybe taking off for a few hours during the day and banging on doors. And I have to do that for a while. I mean, it gets away. Where's on you? So when I kind of took my business from a marketing from a selling business, which is what I call that part of business, into more of a marketing business, that's when the calls people started coming to me. Yeah, attraction. Exactly, exactly. It wasn't a get rich quick scheme. I mean, that's something that takes time. It takes time, but it'll pay off. Jake Canone is my guest today. He is with William Raevis in Fairfield County, Connecticut. They are luxury broker in a very wonderful, beautiful part of our country. I'm going to tell you more about Jay. He has been in real estate. He is a really a legend in real estate 40 years. And through Booms, Busts and Battles, many agents haven't experienced, but Jay has. He has raised four kids and built a business entirely from scratch. He carried his family, his pain, his pressure, while still showing up with professionalism and tenacity throughout these 40 years. His son struggled with addiction for 13 years, and sadly, they lost them in 2020, but Jay has been through hell, but he is kept going, not just because he had to, but because he made a commitment to helping others win. And even when life gets hard, Jay understands real struggle, and he fights for his clients like their his own family. He has been nationally recognized. He has spoken at National Association of REALTORS. He's been in the National REALTORS magazine. He was actually, you were quoted or actually talked about in a very important book called, Grill of Marketing by Jay Levinson, by the way, that this is, Jay is a very, very big deal. He is all about trust-based reputation, built through constant personal branding and just being an authentic good human being. I want everybody to follow Jay at his Instagram account, which is Jay Canone, underscore real estate. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. Jay, what a wonderful pleasure it is to have you on the show. Welcome. Well, thank you, DJ. I appreciate that introduction. I don't feel like I'm that important, but thank you so much. Well, that's what everybody who's important says. They go, oh, I'm not that big of the deal. And, yeah, well, I think your track record is so impressive. I've looked into it and I know what a big deal you are. And I know that this is a job of carry wood, or sorry, carry water, chop wood every single day. It is rinse and repeat. It is doing the hard things that you have done for your clients for all this time. But I want to start at the beginning of the story and then let's get to kind of where we are today because you've been doing this for decades. Tell us how you got into real estate. Gosh, I got to remember back now. So no, no, actually my dad, my dad was in the real estate business. My father was a co-owner of a pretty large real estate company right here in Fairfield County. And I always admired my father. I always liked the lifestyle that he led. I always appreciated the facts. I mean, as I got a little bit older, I mean, I always appreciated the facts that he was always at our ball games. He always sat with the family for dinner. It was a really good father. You know, when I admired his job, I admired what he did. And I admired the respect that he had and people gave him. And I always said that I wanted to do a dad and I wanted to do what my father did. So it's funny, DJ, because I went off to college. After graduating high school, obviously, I was 18 years old. I went off to college for one year. I went to Northeastern University in Boston. And every time I would call home, you know, my father would, you know, I'd be like, hey, pop, how you doing? My dad said, hey, how you doing, Janet? Goody, I just got out of math class. Just got out of history class. And you know, my father would say, well, you know, that's good. We just opened up another office today or I just bought another Ferrari or I just bought a, I just got back from another trip from, I'm like, what am I doing in college? I got to get into the family business. So that was, I should have finished college. Number one, that was, I should have finished college, but I ended up leaving college. And I got into the business. And my mom and dad did not want me to leave college. They begged me to stay, but I was really convinced that I could do real estate. I was 19. So my mother and father were just kind of like, all right, you know what, let them get into the business. Let them try it. And probably about six months, they'll be begging to get back to college and get back to those buddies and party again. So it was like October of 1984, is when I actually started the right page of 19. And you know, back then DJ, you don't know it, but back then, all I knew was I had to find people that had to buy and sell. I mean, that's all that I knew. And you know, I never watched my dad do a listing presentation. I never watched any of that stuff. My father put me out into one of his offices and I had a manager, his name is John. And if it wasn't for John, I probably still would, I would not be here today to be honest with you because he really took me under his wing and really gave me some special attention. And it was amazing. He was a tremendous mentor. And I tell him that every time I see him. And you know, I mean, that year, I sold 49 houses when I was 19. 19. It was my mom and dad said, I guess he's not going back to school. I mean, who gives a 19 year old a home to sell? That's amazing. But I used that to my advantage. I always used my age to my advantage saying that I wanted to make this my career. And I was going to work 15 times harder. Yeah. To make it my career. And people just, they bought into it. And it was the rest was history. It was amazing. It was, I mean, back then, DJ too, don't forget. I mean, I'd get into the office and say seven o'clock in the morning. I was the first one in the office. And back then we had newspapers. And you know, inside the newspaper, it would say, you know, all the four sale by owners would be in the newspaper. And you know, people that got job promotions were in the newspaper, birth announcements were in the newspaper. Everything you want to know, people that are renting apartments, people that were, everything was in the newspapers. So I would literally go through the newspaper and call every single person in there. Sure. Congratulations. Congratulations on their new job promotion. Now you're making more money. You want a bigger house or congratulations on your new baby. Maybe you need an extra bedroom. I mean, so it was, it was a lot of fun. You know, like I said, get up and, you know, right in the middle of the day and just go out and put a backpack with some brochures on my back or some business card. Just go knocking on doors all day. And I mean, what a great way to start the day. You're basically just spreading joy and congratulating people on these accomplishments, life, life achievements. I mean, if you think about it, it's, there's, there's worse calls to make, right? Like you could have been selling something else that wouldn't have been that kind of phone call, right? You would have been the kind of call that people want to slam the phone number. And you're calling going, oh my God, I just saw that you had a baby. Congratulations, right? That is a, that is a very warm, warm introduction. And I'm sure not every call of course leads to a sale, but it is at least very flattering and complimentary phone call. I like to make all my phone calls even to this day that way. I always try to make an uplifting happy, you know, congratulatory phone call. But yeah, you're right. It was, it was a cool way. It was, but you know, listen, and after doing that for five or 10 years, you know, it gets, it gets to, where's on you? Sure. It was on you. I mean, my son, Cross, got his license about three years ago. And, you know, he, it was, it was difficult, you know, hearing all those knows for him. And having all those people slam the phone down on him. And, you know, it gets, it, it wears on you. And not it, but listen, man, you, if you're in this real estate business, you've got to have thick skin. You've got to be disciplined. You've got to have some thick skin and just say, you know what, if someone slams the phone down, next, and not even think about it, it's over. It was funny. Back in the day, there was a guy by the name of, his name was Tom Hopkins. I don't know if you're, Oh, sure. I don't know. He had a funny face to go to the seminars back in the day, back in the 80s, but he had something really funny. He said, you know, think about how much your commission is. Let's say it was $1,000, you know, and how many calls that it make you or take you to get that $1,000 sale? So break it down. How much was every phone call worth, you know? $20, $20 is a phone call. So when somebody would start swearing at me on the telephone and raiding, I'd say, listen, thank you for the 20. It's a good way to look at it. Well, it's all about, it's not attitude in mindset, right? And that's exactly it, right? Like you, you're absolutely right. It's not fun to get those phone calls. Nobody wants to be rejected. Nobody wants to be sworn at. And yet, every call is another call closer to the deal. And of course, it is technically you are making money. If you think about it, as long as you keep going because you are going to get the closer to the, yes, you're getting absolutely on a percent. My dad and I did decide to open up a real estate company in 1989. So we opened up a real estate company in 1989. We called it John Cannon real estate and I worked with my father. And we were literally side by side for, oh gosh, until 1996. And working with your parents was not always very easy. And I always said, I always said to myself, I said, you know, pop, I love you. I said, I'll see you on Sunday for dinner. But I got a goal because either you're going to kill me or I'm going to kill you, but one of us are going to die. I got to go. My father had those really old school mentalities and those are the grindstone. And I was kind of getting more into the marketing way of business. We just had a different philosophies. And if I had a tremendous amount of respect for my father, he gave me a lot of knowledge. But my dad's gone. He passed away about maybe like three or four years ago. My dad ended up going back. Grumped, he lost everything he had. Had a very bad, so I mean, I'm telling you, it wasn't all roses here for me. It wasn't, you know, I didn't hear it. The big business. I got into the business because of my parents, my dad, but here I am 40 years later and I'm still selling the business. I love the business. I mean, I'm still working the business. I love it. But yeah, it's amazing. You have definitely had your share of struggle. And I love that you're so earnest about some of the challenges of life. And I admire that. I honor you for that. I think it takes tremendous courage to share that. And really, show me the perfect person with the perfect life. Everyone's got them. Very few people are willing to talk about it. And I hope that hopefully what I say can help somebody, maybe, you know, I, I hope so because I, I can feel it in you. You have an authenticity. You have a, a need to connect. And I suspect your clients feel that from you. You probably have, I mean, you know, I was looking when I was doing my research on you. It's like, oh, Jay is like the mayor, and he's not the mayor, of course, but not technically the mayor, but he is a very well-known person in his town. He's foreign and raised there. He's been there for his entire life. He's service the community. He obviously sells in the community and he is in the community. And he is a very important person within Trumbull. And that is your town. And I am just, it is just amazing to see what you've built. But it hasn't been easy, right? Yeah, it's been a lot of hard work and a lot of setbacks. And of course, everybody's life has them. Most people aren't willing to share. And I, I, I, I, I deal with what makes the man how you deal with them and how you continue to move forward. That's, that's what it's all about in life. It's moving forward, continuing to move forward. Yeah, I was, I find that too. I was listening to someone else talk about this recently that we've made our lives. Someone else was talking and saying, we've been our lives very resistance free, right? We have so much convenience in our life. And that's good. That's good. But it, it, it's a problem in a way because if we don't have challenge, we don't learn. We, we don't learn how to become stronger. So you almost have to in this day and age because we're so technologically advanced. We have so many amenities. Obviously in this country, we're, we're so blessed to all the, you know, all the things that we have here. But you almost have to put your own obstacles in the path if you don't have them already because, you know, it's the only way we can grow and learn and get stronger. And, you know, you don't even have to go out and get groceries anymore. You can just have those delivered to you. Yeah, I didn't expect that. Yeah. Yeah. And so, you know, it's, it is, it is impressive, you know, what, what you've been through. And I appreciate you sharing some of those stories. And I'm excited to, to hear more, more from them. I want to hear a little bit about what your clients mean to you because I know you are somebody that feels things very deeply. They're important to you. And tell us a little bit about how you think about your clients. I think about my clients now, much differently than I did in the past. As I've aged, you know, when you're a 19 or a 20, my wife and I have been dating since we were 14 years old, we've been together. We got married. We were 22. We had our first son. We were 24. And my wife has never had a paying job her whole life. She's always been a home mom. So I pulled this wagon all by myself, you know? So when you're, when you're doing real estate and you're trying to raise a family and say, you've got four kids, man, you're just running. I'm running and running and running and running. And I'm just going from one deal to the next to the next to the next. Just to, just try to make ends meet just to build it. You know, and, um, but that's, this is, now this is an important thing I'm going to say right now because that, this is probably the one thing in my life that I probably regret the most. I wish I've met some amazing, amazing people along the way that were just amazing people. I mean, just people that I really connected because you know, when you're selling their house or you're working with them as a buyer or what, you just, you develop that really close relationship, you know, and, um, I just wish I, I wish I had stopped and smelled the roses, man. I wish I had talked to these people a little more and got to know them because all of a sudden before I know it, I'm just running to the next deal and I haven't spoken to these people anymore. And all of a sudden, two, three, four years goes by. So one of the words, so one of the biggest advice that I give to my son and I can give to whoever's watching this podcast right now is develop that relationship because you meet some wonderful and amazing people and really get to know him and, and, and don't, and hang on to those relationships. I mean, it'll also, it's very gratifying to you as a person, but besides that it'll obviously help you in business as well because now that those elites here referrals in the future. Um, and now that we have, you know, now, you know, we have all the social media and all these kinds of reviews and testimonials that can be seen all over the world. It's, uh, it's amazing, but that's, that's something that I, I regret and, uh, that I've actually changed quite a bit getting to know my friends. So becoming more intimate with your clients, checking in on them, letting them know that you're still, uh, invested in them after the transaction. I wish my wife and I just went out to dinner on Friday with clients of mine. I've never done that before. You know, I mean, we've been doing it the last five years or so, but, you know, we went to dinner with friends now with these people. We become friends and I, and I really look back and I, you know, some of my just pick up the phone and call it. I'm just like, Hey, what's going on? I miss you. You know, I haven't seen it. Yeah. Yeah. That's that change a lot. It's important. Let's talk about branding because I know you have a brand and, and when, when, looking when I was researching you, boy, you have a brand and it, I would say your brand is professional luxury kind. I think there's an empathy to you that is resonates in your material, uh, very, um, determined and relentless, but, uh, but, but just overall like good guy. I feel like good guy is your brand. Uh, tell me about your bread. Thank you. I appreciate that. So again, I kind of, I can't really take credit for a lot of this because it was back in 1997. Now I just, now I was with William Ravens. I had left my dad. I was with William Ravens. And it was a guy in my office and he had this business card with a logo on it. It was like a beautiful, like little beach scene, you know, with the, with the grasses and the sunset in the background. And I kind of looked at him. I was like, wow, that's a beautiful business card you have there. Where'd you get that? He wouldn't tell me. He was like, well, I'm not telling you. You know, I give away secrets. So I eventually found out from my office manager that he had worked with a company called Hobbs Herter, which at the time was a, which ended up becoming the largest real estate, advertising marketing company in the United States. Yeah. And I called the Hobbs Herter and they said, oh, we're going to be doing a seminar in New York City, in two weeks from now, why don't you show up and so my wife and I, we went, you know, and again, you know, we weren't, we were struggling. You know, I was just paying the bills and someone and so forth. And we went to the seminar and it wasn't Don Hobbs or Greg Herter that was running the seminar. I was just one of his salespeople and it was all about branding. You know, it was, it was about being the brand. Don't blend in. You know, and it was all about creating the brochure. It was about creating the story about finding out what your niche is, who's your audience going to be? You know, so I, I filled out this, I ended up buying into the system. You know, they had like systems that went from like $5,000 to $25,000. You know, if you want, you want a postcard, you want a house flyer, you want a website, you want business cards, you know, so I picked the basic, smallest packers that they had and I had my personal brochure, my business cards and my house flyer, my postcards. And I, I was really, I was really taken back by what I, what they did for me. I mean, they just, they really taught me that the brand is, is really, is everything to you. The brand is very, very important to DJ. And it was funny because I mean, when I first started, when I switched, remember I told you about the old way of doing business, the door knocking and then the new way is the marketing. But I always, I always said that, you know, when I first started with this, this, this business, I, with this marketing type of business, I, I was, I mean, I was like trying to do mail outs. I was trying to do small little advertisements in the newspaper, little black and white, you know, two by two ads in the newspaper and things and I was sending out these postcards for about 10 months. And I mean, I was literally getting nothing, nothing at all. I mean, and, and Hobbs heard the company was telling me what to put on the postcards. Who do mail the postcards to? I mean, it was a complete system they had. And I was getting no results whatsoever. And I was also stopping. I was kind of getting away from my, my business of cold calling and door knocking and I was putting everything into the, into the marketing aspect of the business. And I was on the verge of bankruptcy. I'm not kidding. I mean, I was, I was like, I was, I was on a full call with Hobbs heard of a bunch of agents from around the country one day. And everyone's like, oh, man, I'm doing it now. It's unbelievable. And I'm getting so much business and it's all the, and I'm just sitting there. I go, I got another story to tell you. I said, I've been doing this for about 10 months. And I'm on the verge of bankruptcy. I've got no phone, no calls, nothing, you know, and, and Don Hobbs was the guy who was holding the phone and he was posting, he was doing the call. And he goes, you know, Jay, sounds like you're doing everything right. He said, just hang in there for a couple more months, man, hang in there. It's something, it's going to click. I'm telling you, it's going to click. And I said, well, I'll try, I'll give it a whirl, you know, those are the days when I was in the grocery store. And I'm pushing the grocery cart and I'm writing a check at the cat, the checkout. And as I'm pushing the grocery, I'm like, I hope to God, that check clears, you know. And he has, yeah, those are some fun times. But I'll just, I'll never forget the day I, I got a phone call. It's just shortly after that. The guy was like, Jay, can you come up and listen to my house? God gave me his name. I went up to his house and he was standing at the door with my postcard in his hand. He goes, come on, let's figure out the price. And let's sign this up. And I'm like, well, he's like, listen, anybody who sends me these postcards is consistently as you've done for the past 10 months. That's who I want to work with. Yeah. And then it was almost like the faucets returned on at that point. I just started getting calls. And don't forget, Jay, at that time too, I was kind of like the pioneer in personal marketing. So they weren't getting these kind of, nobody was really getting these marketing materials in the mail back then. But, but yeah, so my business, my business went from, let's say, oh gosh, from, let's say, $3 million to almost $17 million in one year. Wow. Yeah, it was just, it was an amazing transformation. And it was all because of the marketing. So, you know, so all of a sudden, my little two by two black and white ads, maybe got to be three and three. And then all of a sudden, they got to be four by four. Then all of a sudden, they turned into color ads and, you know, my 500, you know, direct mail turned into a thousand people to 1500 to 2000 people. So as, as my business crew, I grew with it. Yeah. But the marketing was really the key. I remember I was, I'm talking. So cut me off if I whenever you want. But no, no, this is, I love it. I was at a real estate. I was at a convention, a Hobbs Herter's convention. And I was in a, I was in a buffet line. And the right in front of me was Greg Herter from Hobbs Herter. And I tapped him on the shoulder and I said, I said, Greg, hi, my name is Jay Kanone. I'm over at Fairfield County, Connecticut. And I just want to tell you, I just want to say thank you to you guys. I said because I'm, you know, my business just went from $13 million to $17 million in a year. And I was on the verge of bankruptcy. And he looked at me as though I had three heads on my shoulder. And I was like, he was like, so I went after this after after the lunch and the seminar started up again. He is like, where's Jake? Where is Jake? Is Jake in the room? And I knew he was looking for me. You know, I, I raised my hand and gave me the microphone. He's like, I go, Jay. And he said, Jay, just tell everybody what you were telling me. And you know, so I told the story. And, you know, he just, I ended up becoming their poster child. You know, I was, I ended up becoming their big thing for that company because of the success that their systems provided for me. But don't get me wrong. I mean, their systems didn't, nobody, not everybody was successful using their systems. But I really used it. I worked it, it worked really, really hard. And I was really committed to it. And I mean, you know, and there was a lot of, a lot of wonderful things started happening. You know, the more money I was making, gosh, my wife, my wife started getting nicer to me. She started becoming nicer to me. We got a bigger house. I mean, a lot of good things started happening, you know. But, um, those are some amazing times, you know, some amazing times. But that was all about the marketing and the branding. Yeah, I, it was, yeah. I'm interested in how you think about today's sort of marketing landscape. So we have social media, we have, you know, all sorts of digital ways to, to reach people. We have, still, we can send mailers, we can do the print stuff. Where do you find that you get the most bang for your buck? Yeah, DJ, I mean, if you think about it, like what is, what is our job as a, you know, marketing to me always became like, you know, I want to, I want to try to get people to like me with one before they've even met me. Because that's really what we need to do when you're marketing out there as agents, is to get people to like you because people do business with people they know like and trust. So those are the three things you're trying to get through with your marketing. Everything that I do, every piece of mail I mail out, everything I do was always geared towards that. It was always geared to let people know who I am as a person. You know, my personal brochure was, you know, three pages long and I had nothing to do with real estate. It was about me as a person and who I am. I want, I want to get people to know me and hopefully like me. Trust me. And then they do business with people that they know like and trust. So social media has just changed the game. I mean, it's just a, it's just a totally new world. I mean, it's just, gosh, if we had this back in, you know, 1990, I don't know, you know, what I would have done. But, yeah, but now I just find it as a, as networking on steroids. And it's just such an amazing way to get people to really get to know you personally intimately. To hear your voice and to get your message. And I just love it. I mean, it's also for my home sellers, it's amazing because now I'm getting 30,000 views on my home tour videos. Yeah, I mean, just, I mean, just these are things that you know, you, what separates me from the competition. I mean, listen, I'm going to get you 30,000 videos, 30,000 views on these, on these home videos. Um, it's just, it's just, I just think it's an amazing thing. I mean, some people, yeah, it's just another piece to my puzzle, but I just think it's such an important piece. And if, and so many people just don't want to take to this video, they don't want to be in front of the cameras like you and I do constantly. See, my philosophy is, who gives a shit? I mean, I, I know my stuff. I know my business. I mean, and it is what it is. And this is who I am. So I have no problem speaking on camera. I have, I actually, I have fun with it. I really do. I really enjoy it. And I don't get me wrong. You know, when I started doing videos, maybe it was six, seven years ago, they weren't as polished as they are now. You know, it was a little iPhone. It was, you know, but now I have a videographer and I do some pretty cool stuff. But listen, man, I don't, I don't need a videographer. I could still use the, the iPhone and, you know, and have a Camacho's is good. I was watching one of your client testimonials earlier today and I was impressed by just the question that was asked to the client, which is a group, such a great question. And it was a little bit nuanced. And for those of us who, you know, watched these kind of things, we might have, we might just blow past it without realizing the power of it. But they were asked, why did you choose Jay? Which I thought was interesting because I didn't seem like they knew you prior. And they said, why did you choose Jay? And they said, well, and they started to answer that question about what you had done to impress them. Why they thought you were the most competent person for the job. And they were doing the marketing for you. And, and they, I'm sure they weren't prompted. It seemed very honest and earnest. And I just thought, what a great question is why did you choose Jay? And I love that. So for all of us that haven't created videos like that, I encourage you to check those out. It's a pow, Jay does powerful testimonials. And he films them very professionally. They are, they look amazing. You don't, of course, as Jay said, you don't have to have, you know, a videographer always with you. But boy, you've captured some amazing moments with your clients. And it really, I don't go I don't go to their house either when I just send my videographer to the house. And he has, I just give him a few questions to ask, you know, he could ask whenever he wants. But that's what, that's what comes out. I'm not even there. I don't. But, you know, I think those video testimonials are very powerful, very, very powerful. Boy, they sure are. I mean, I was impressed. I was watching them and I've seen a lot of REALTOR testimonial videos. And usually they're all very similar. Yours are not. Yours are different. And I just thought, you know, boy, that makes a lot of sense. I want to know why people choose you. I don't want to know that I should choose Jay. I want to know why people choose Jay, right? And that's a pretty unique distinction. And it sounds simple and it sounds like obvious. But if we really think about it, we're talking about branding. And your brand is consistency, authenticity, relentless work ethic, treating every client like family. And everything you put out there sort of shines through that lens. And you can hear it in your client's responses. So if everyone should check out Jay, your YouTube channel. We'll have a link to that in the show notes as well. Because you do get a lot of views on your various videos as well as you just have a lot of people in your corner. I want to talk about contribution because I know that's really significant to you and has made a big impact in your life. You've been a part of organizations for years. Talk about sort of the organizations you support and why you support them. You know, DJ, like you had mentioned in my introduction, you know, my son battled opiate addiction, you know, for, oh gosh, he was 16 years old. He passed away when he was 29. So 13 years and on December 20th, it'll be his, the fifth year anniversary of his death. But if you take the five years since he's been gone in the 13 years while he was with us, with the addiction, I was, I was still trying to function with a 75 pound weight on my shoulder, 24, 7. Because addiction is one of the worst things that I could ever wish I could wish it had anybody. It's, you know, tear people apart, tear families apart. It's a very, very difficult thing. It's, it was like living with a terrorist 24, 7. It was very scary. I miss my son terribly, but I don't miss the addiction. And, you know, my son Kyle, you know, my son John passed away when Kyle just started his first semester in law school. And he just got sworn into the party. Congratulations to the Connecticut bar. Thank you. You know, we were, we were, when I heard the past the bar, I just, I felt to the floor of my kitchen, just crying like a baby. But, um, but what was the question DJ just just remind me where I was going? Oh, just that, you know, contribution, giving back to the community. Yeah, so what I'm saying is now, now I'm, I'm really getting more involved now with my community. For example, I live in the Nicholas part of Trumbo, which is, you know, let's say our town is broken up in a certain areas. We got the Nichols section, the Daniels farm section, the Tashwood section. And, and down here in Nichols, it's, it's kind of historic. A lot of the houses are placked. And we have an NIA, which is a Nichols Improving Association. And I've, you know, a few years ago, I decided to get involved with the NIA. And, you know, now I'm the membership chairman. I, I just took on a responsibility to be the chairman for the, uh, the nominating committee for the next year's executive board. I'm going to be on as well. They're pushing me to be president, but I don't really have the time to be the president. He, the guy that we have right now, his name is Bryce. And he's amazing. He's there. He's retired. He needed a retired person to do that job. As a matter of fact, today, I mean, we have a bonfire set for December 14th. And it's a community thing. People in Nichols all gather in the park and run it up at the NIA building. And we have an amazing bonfire. I think it's probably, if you're in a space, you can probably see this thing burning from there. So I actually collected 250 pallets today. I rented a truck at Home Depot this morning, 830, me and my two boys. And we went and we picked up 250 pallets from a couple of businesses. And we took like six or seven trips and went back and forth into business and started the pile for the pallets for the bonfire. And I just get so much joy out of that, you know, now. And it was just something I felt as though I really couldn't do before. And I just never could really get involved with certain things that I was passionate about. Organizations or, or, you know, my son Cross was a wrestler. He's, my gosh, he's about 26 years old now. But he went to school in Iowa. And he won the NCAA National Title. He's an NCAA champion. He's amazing. The greatest times in my life, by the way, being out there in the Midwest watching him become the best in the country. But that was the, that was really the thing that even trying to be with him was difficult back then, you know, just because my wife needed me around the house. It was, it was real tough times. But again, getting involved with my community and my friends and people is just such a joy, it's so uplifting. And just to get back to the community and just things that you're passionate about, you know. You're a guy who I assume has a lot of structure. And I know, of course, as a REALTOR, your day probably fluctuates. It looks different from what you've structured previously. But tell us what is a normal day look like for you? Normal day for me is, you know, I'm getting up, I get up in the morning, I get up very early, I'm up up 5, 3 AM, 6 o'clock. And I usually, I usually jump into my sweatpants and I get into my car and it's dark outside and I drive to the fitness edge. You know, I drive over here to the gym. Actually, it's plant fitness. And I work out of the morning for about an hour and a half. And I do a lot of cardio. As a matter of fact, I lost 50 pounds in the past 13 months. Thank you. Actually, about 45 pounds. Yeah, it's amazing. I made a commitment and I really stopped doing it. Yeah, there was no drugs involved just diet and exercise, man. I mean, just really very, very strict. I feel great. So I've been going to the gym every day. I have a sauna inside my house. So I come home and I do a sauna. In my sauna, I do a little meditating and I just do my gratitude every day. Just like these guys like Tom Ferry and all these other fellas tell you to do. It's just a wonderful thing. I'm usually in my office by about 9 o'clock am. And I always had my day set the night before. So I'm usually banging out my phone calls in the morning. I go out and preview some houses later in the morning. I'm usually going on my list in presentations in the afternoon. Sometimes they're in the evening as well. I always take that hour for lunch and spend some time with my wife. I really enjoy being with my wife. I think she's she's been with me now for the last couple of years. I really have her involved in the real state business. Not to the point. Just being by my side. And my wife is just a beautiful person. She's a wonderful person. She's she's from down south. She was born in Kentucky. So you know, she was a nice person being from down south. Not like a parent Connecticut in New York. Yeah, everyone says she you're not from around here. Ain't no. But um, yeah, she's she's um she's my yin to the yang. Is that what they say? She's she's just so lovable that people just love her. You know, they love for who she's so genuine. You know, when I go on a listing presentation, she just comes with me to state. They just before you know it, I mean, they're just talking about gardening and they're talking about, you know, I mean, they're they're walking around looking around. It's just it's just amazing. And then I'm just, you know, I'm just very focused on the business aspect of the other appointment and we make a good team together. So she's um, she's getting a real estate license. Not because I wanted to, you know, I wanted to get a little bit more involved and maybe post-smoping houses and things like that. So just I imagine she would be very pleased to hear how you described her and how much you as enjoy her and and how much how much fun you can you can hear in your voice spending time with your wife. DJ, I tell her all the time. I tell her all the time. I like I said, you know, when my son John passed away, I got so many people that that said, you know, they they sort of calling me and writing me letters and you know texting me and all kinds of stuff and telling me how how John my son John had in fact, infected, affected their lives and how he personally touched these people. Whether it was through his music because he was amazing musician. I mean, he could play piano, play guitar. Everyone took a lesson. Just could in, you're just an amazing kid. But I after, you know, when he was gone, I kind of sat back and I said to myself, if John knew how much people cared about him and loved him and how how he influenced so many lives and how he affected people, whether it was he was a personal trainer at the gym too. I mean, it was a power lifter. It was amazing. And I said, no, I don't think it would have affected him because that's how powerful the drug is. Yeah. Because when it gets inside you it gets into your soul and nothing else matters. And it's so it's a horrible thing. But um, where was I going with this? You know, we were saying if he if he he were to know how much he touched people and and how how much they loved him. Right. And I said the answer to that would be no. But the point that I'm making is that I make it an effort right now. I make an effort to tell anybody in my life who's touched me in a positive way. How much they have touched me in a positive way and what they've meant to my life. And I tell my family that I love them every single day. I tell people that I love how much I love them. And I'm not going to wait for them to be gone before I do that. Yeah. I mean, remember I see people that have affected my life in a positive way, whether it's in a restaurant or a don't can don't wherever I am. Even a Starbucks. I'd be like, hey man, I would tell you how what you've done for my life always. I have that same philosophy. I you know, you sort of we all have an expiration date. We don't know what it is. And we don't know. Yeah. And we don't know when anyone else's last last moments are. And we don't know when ours are. And this idea that you know, don't die with your music still in you, right? Like the idea that somebody matters to you. And right now you could pick up the phone and tell them right now you could call a client that you haven't called in 10 years and say, I'm sorry, I haven't called you in 10 years. I care about you and I'm thinking about you. And I just wanted you to know that. And you know, family friends, it is it is such an easy thing to do now. We are so easily connected. And yet I find that, you know, we we often don't. And I would encourage everyone listening to think about the people that matter to them. And remember that they won't be here forever. And they might not be here tomorrow. Hopefully they will, but maybe they won't. And think about what would you want them to know before before their final moments. And this is the time to share it with them. And what what I've found by sharing that I'm curious to get your thoughts is it opens up the opportunity for the other person to also share. It's usually not just a one way conversation. The other person usually says, well, you mean a lot to me as well. And then you get to have the shared intimate moment. And it's appreciation. So I'm curious how a lot of those conversations end up going for you. Well, it's funny how you just said that because you know, I was just there was this guy named George who was very close friend of my dad. And his son his son was just diagnosed with cancer. And I called up George and I just me got a thank you for being such a good friend to my to my parents when they were around, you know, and how you're so close to my dad. And just they just thanked him for just being such a good person and good good friend of our family. And he goes, you know, I was told you're old man, you're better than he was. You're definitely better than I got a kick out of that. But you're right. How you just said, you know, by telling somebody and he turned it around and said, you know, you were a better you were a better REALTOR. Your father was nice. So listen, again, the day we all our children would be better than what we are, you know, that's really what we want. That's that's our goal in life is to have our kids do more, be more than we have. But um, but yeah. Well, I, I, you know, I want to end with, you know, if, if you were to talk to the younger you who didn't know everything that you know now, what would you say to the younger you that didn't know that back then, but that you are really clear. You know, what would you tell the younger you? Well, I mean, there's a couple of things. DJ, I mean, number one is, I mean, I want to get back to that because again, a lot of that is, you know, smelling the roses that I had talked about earlier. That's what I would definitely tell the younger me is don't just keep running. But one thing that I do now with my with my clients too, and I think this is a big, this, this really differentiates me from other agents that are out there plugging along as well too. I, when I, when I approach my home sellers, primarily home sellers, it's a team effort that I, that I bring to the table. You know, it's not just about me. It's about you, DJ, if I'm selling your house, I need you to be a part of this. You know, I want you, it's your house. You live there. You know, all about your house. You know, I want you to, you know, we're all straight down all the amenities that you enjoyed. Why you bought the house, all of your amenities. You know, let's, let's hear everything. I want you to, when I do my right up on your house, I want to email it to in the morning. I want you to critique it. I want you to proof it. You know, change it. Do you want things taken out? Do you want things added in? When I do my photography, I want you to look at all the photos. And do you want to take some photos out? Do you, do you, do you have certain photos that you like? Especially, I just, I just want it, it's a team effort. And that's something that, um, that people really appreciate a lot. And they, you know, they're also like, oh, God, I wonder what this REALTOR's going to do. I'm like, no, it's not the, it's about what we're going to do. We're a team. Yeah. We're a team. We're going to get this done together. I mean, this is a very stressful thing that you guys are going to go through right now. Yeah. It says, this is not fun. And I tell them it's not fun, man. I mean, it's a, it's a big inconvenience. And there's a lot of stress and pressure. And we're going to have some speed bumps. Yeah. There's always a speed bump. Yeah. Always speed bumps. You know, we're going to get over those. But, but at the end of the day, it's going to be a great end result. It's going to be a great end result. But we'll just take it in little steps. And we take it in those little steps. If you look at the whole picture as a, as a big picture, it could be very overwhelming. But just break it down to little steps. You know, that's the first thing we got to do. We got to get your house stage. We got to do this. We got to do that. We got to, and then we're going to get there. And then we're going to get it on the market. And then we're going to do this. Then we're going to do that. But I'll take care of all the work. I just want your help to a certain extent, you know, to a certain extent. But if I'm looking back at my, my old, old J, I would say to the old guys, I'd say, you know what? Count your blessings, your gratitude. Take better care of yourself than you do on your job because you are the motor, you are the engine that runs everything. Stay in shape. I would say, you know, be very disciplined. Always, always be looking for new and modern technology. Always be, always be a student of the game. Always be learning. Always be going to seminars. Always be learning the latest technology. Just trying to stay up on, on everything, keeping current matters and things like that. Just learning about the markets, the real estate markets, the interest rates, just, just being a knowledgeable person. I do a lot of seminars to real estate seminars. I host some restaurants. I'm just a knowledge person. I bring a team of experts with me. I wish I had done that 30 years ago. And again, being a knowledge broker, staying in contact, networking with people, staying in contact with these people that you're dealing with because God, like I tell you, you're handling one of the biggest things in their life that they'll ever have to go through. And it's stressful as all heck, you know? You've got to put yourself in their shoes too and understand what they're going through. You know, sometimes I go into a house. I mean, it's a horrible divorce. Sometimes I'll go into a house and it was just a tragic death. Sometimes it's not all that. So I deal with a lot of broken people sometimes and I've got to help. I'm helping everybody. Regardless of who they are, I've got to help. They need to get their household and you're going to get it sold for the most money I physically possibly can. And I've got to do it in the least amount of time. I've got to do it stress-free for them. I've got to make them have a wonderful experience, turn them into raving fans and make it as stress-free as possible because we all have enough stress in our lives. We don't have to add to it. I don't need to add to it. I need to help them. And that's that's the mentality that goes into everything. And that's where I would kind of tell my old self, man. The young guys get into the business and also you've got to stay disciplined. You've got to have a game plan. You've got to create a daily work habit and you've got to stick to that day. You've got to stick to it every single day because if you're consistent and you work hard, it's going to pay off. There's no doubt about it. 100 percent will pay off. This is a career. You know people are like, oh, I'm going to try real estate. I'm going to get it. No, no, this is this is a business and you got to treat it like a business. It's like opening up a restaurant without any food. If you need to spend some money sometimes on yourself, you've got to invest in yourself. You've got to build your brand. You sometimes have to put some ads out there, some Facebook ads, some Instagram ads. You've got to sometimes maybe pay a video out of the fur. Do some post direct mail or have some nice branded sign writers. You've got to do these things. You've got to write checks. It's a business. You've got to build your business. And I wish I had known that when I first started too. It took me 20 years to learn all that. Well, you certainly know it now and I was going to ask you if retirement is something on the horizon, but I would suspect you would say no because you like what you do so much. I don't see you stopping doing this until you want to. Well, that's what retirement is. DJ, what is your time to you? Well, I love what I do and my father also loved what he did and he just finally stopped at 78 because he said, I have my body's kind of telling me it's time, but he goes, but I could keep going, but maybe yeah, and but he loved it. And he was he was like, why would I stop doing what I love? And I love that he worked at 78. And I imagine he all similar. My I have no, I think I'm just getting started to be honest with you. Honest to God, I think the best years were ahead of me. And they are going to be ahead of me. This year was a record breaking year. I've done over $30 million in volume. I've sold over 40 houses. It's been it has been a wonderful year. And you know, next year my goals are going to be higher. And retirement for me is is working because I want to and not because I have to. Yeah. That's what retirement is. Working because I want to and not because I have to. So make the right investments to the younger Jay who's out there right now. Make wise investments. Save your money. You don't need to buy the Porsche or the Mercedes. You can go out and buy a nice little two family house. Yeah. Live in one net for a year or so. And then rent them out and go buy another one or go. But you know, invest in real estate. You never go wrong. It's a tremendous way to retire. Because in 20 years from now, you loan 20 properties. Yeah. And half of those properties that you own will probably be mortgaged free and there just be a tremendous cash flow. Yeah. So invest in real estate. You sell it. You should be investing in it. Don't ever compete against your clients. That was one thing my dad taught me since son. Don't don't compete against your clients. Don't buy. Don't. Don't be a speculator to a certain extent. I'm not a flipper. I'll sell my I'll sell my flips to my clients. Because that's not who I am. I'm not a flipper. I'm a REALTOR. My father told me that years ago. What do you want to be son? Do you want to be a speculator? Do you want to be an event weight or do you want to be a REALTOR? What do you want to do? Because it's hard to do them well and do them well. Yeah. I wanted to be a REALTOR. So I've made other people a lot of money over the years and I find great joy in that too. But there's nothing wrong with buying a nice two family or a nice piece of property once a year if you're a young guy and you know building a little real estate empire is a wonderful thing. Well Jay, I am so grateful that you spent time with us today. You are authentic is probably not even enough of a word to describe how genuine of a person you seem to be and your clients resonate that same exact sentimentality when I watch some of these videos and I'm so grateful to have had you on the show. I've done this almost 700 times and I don't get to speak to somebody quite like you as often as I would prefer. So on behalf of the audience and I know they appreciated it because I appreciated it and we say thank you and on behalf of Jay and myself, we also say thank you to the audience to sticking around and being here all the way to the very end and listening to Jay's stories and listening to his authenticity and his advice about how to build a wonderful life and how to persevere when times get hard and they do. Always move forward. You always got to move forward but you always got it. There's going to be life's going to kick you the ass and knock you to the ground. You just got to get up brush you off and keep going. It's good. I don't know if there's a god of course but if there is that it'll be my first question when I get to meet god, I will say why did you make it so hard? I mean you can call because it was supposed to be so hard but but but but I'm afraid you also had a tremendous amount of blessings though. Absolutely and any any day above ground is a victory. Any day. Every day. No, that's a start. Yeah. Yeah and attitude mentality consistency. I hear that in your your very intentional. You are you are a serious but soft person which I love in your very authentic and what what a pleasure to have you on the show. This is the kind of people that I love to feature on this podcast on behalf of everyone. You know thank you again for our audience to our sponsors to our guest Jay and we will see everybody on our next episode. I will encourage everybody to please send this episode to another agent right. Jay has been doing this for 40 years. There's a lot of agents that are maybe feeling like I might want to get out of the business right now because times aren't aren't as easy as maybe they'd like them to be. Jay is a great example of why you. I was going to say to DJ DJ. You guys can reach out to me anytime text message or you know through Instagram and or give me a call and I'm more happy to help however I can. You know we have advice I can help you guys with. And also if you're an agent who has clients that move to Fairfield County or anyone who read Connecticut Jay would love an opportunity to connect with you and also he has clients that move out of Connecticut. So you should reach out to yourself. That's right especially if you will live in a warm climate that is that is especially right now this time of year it's starting to look a lot a lot better to go down there. And so anyway Jay thank you so much. Please everyone tell another agent about this podcast. We appreciate you. This is how we grow and we love our listeners and our guests as well and what everybody to have a happy and healthy holiday season and we will see you on the next episode. Thanks Jay. Thanks DJ.
