[00:05:39] Jordan, welcome to the show.
[00:05:41] Man, DJ, that was a hell of an introduction, man.
[00:05:44] I appreciate it so much.
[00:05:46] Thank you.
[00:05:46] You're a hell of a guest or excited to have you.
[00:05:48] I'm very grateful and humbled that you said such kind stuff, man.
[00:05:52] So thank you from bottom of my heart.
[00:05:54] Well, thank you for making time for our show and our audience.
[00:05:58] We appreciate it.
[00:05:59] And you are known as a guy at the top of the RE/MAX mountain.
[00:06:04] But our audience is always interested in hearing how people climb the mountain first.
[00:06:10] So I would be curious to know how did you get into real estate?
[00:06:13] Was it something you always knew that you wanted to do?
[00:06:16] Or was this like a career change?
[00:06:17] So love to hear that story.
[00:06:19] Oh, okay.
[00:06:20] Sounds good, DJ.
[00:06:21] So no, I was kind of the opposite of what I wanted to do.
[00:06:25] Because my parents had done it, but they kind of struggled.
[00:06:28] They were always kind of deal to deal when I was growing up.
[00:06:30] So it was kind of the opposite.
[00:06:32] But I was a terrible student.
[00:06:33] I graduated from college with a 2.05 GPA.
[00:06:36] I cheated my way through.
[00:06:39] And therefore, when I graduated, I didn't have any big corporations,
[00:06:42] not to down my door or anything like that.
[00:06:44] So the only thing I had going for me, I thought was a good personality.
[00:06:47] So I knew I would go into some sort of sales.
[00:06:50] But in truth, I wanted to be an insurance guy.
[00:06:53] Because I wanted to be opposite of real estate.
[00:06:55] So I wanted to be insurance, but then there was a guy named Jim
[00:06:58] that worked out at the gym that I worked out at.
[00:07:01] And he carried business cards in the socks.
[00:07:03] And he walked around, everybody scattered away from him.
[00:07:07] Because he was Jim the insurance guy.
[00:07:08] Brut, so I said, I don't want to be that guy.
[00:07:11] That just went up to people who was trying to sell insurance.
[00:07:13] And there's anything wrong with insurance.
[00:07:15] We all need it, but I didn't want to be that guy.
[00:07:17] People ran from.
[00:07:18] So basically, what I did was I started a little business
[00:07:22] when I was in college called Property Promotions,
[00:07:24] where I did will say, advertise for my parents or for other REALTORS.
[00:07:28] So I saw, I met all the REALTORS in the San Fernando Valley
[00:07:30] where I'm from.
[00:07:31] And most of them kind of struggled, but there was a few that did well.
[00:07:35] And there was one guy that in those days, we're going back 33, 34 years ago.
[00:07:40] There was one guy that was the number one guy
[00:07:42] who was making 400 grand a year.
[00:07:44] His broker told me that.
[00:07:45] That's more than NFL players made.
[00:07:48] I didn't know anybody can make that kind of money.
[00:07:51] Huge money.
[00:07:52] Huge money.
[00:07:52] So I was like, oh, shit.
[00:07:54] Real estate isn't such a bad thing, man.
[00:07:57] So I went into real estate right after college.
[00:08:01] Once I learned that somebody could actually make that kind of money,
[00:08:03] I started an entry-level housing.
[00:08:06] My ever sales price was under 200,000.
[00:08:08] For the first seven years of my career, it was 150,000,
[00:08:12] 200,000.
[00:08:13] You know, I even did a many deals under 100,000.
[00:08:16] And then after about seven years, I got my first pro athlete.
[00:08:21] And he said, hey, man, he just signed with the Philadelphia 76ers
[00:08:24] and he goes, hey, man,
[00:08:26] let's look in West Lake Village.
[00:08:28] Now, you gotta remember, this was before the internet DJ.
[00:08:32] So I didn't really, I'd never even been to West Lake Village.
[00:08:35] I didn't even know where it was.
[00:08:36] And he goes, hey, I think there's some, you know,
[00:08:38] a million dollar gargated communities.
[00:08:40] I go, oh, man, there's some amazing gargated communities.
[00:08:43] I had no idea, DJ.
[00:08:45] I didn't even know where West Lake was.
[00:08:47] So I went out there, I quickly learned
[00:08:50] that there were some gargated communities.
[00:08:52] I did that first deal with him, which was, I think it was around a million and a half
[00:08:57] dollars.
[00:08:57] And I got that lottery money.
[00:08:59] I'd never seen a paycheck like that.
[00:09:02] But for me, the interesting thing was I met all the REALTOR's that were selling these
[00:09:07] million dollar homes DJ.
[00:09:09] And they were all very nice.
[00:09:10] But I remember, they can man, they're not any better than just because they're
[00:09:15] selling million dollar homes.
[00:09:16] And I'm selling 200,000 dollar homes.
[00:09:18] I thought I could compete with them.
[00:09:20] So I did that deal.
[00:09:21] I packed up my shit.
[00:09:22] I told my wife, we were just married, we've been married for 30 years.
[00:09:26] I said, man, these people can sell million dollar homes.
[00:09:28] I think I could do it too.
[00:09:29] So I packed up and started all over.
[00:09:32] It is interesting.
[00:09:33] I remember I talked to a guy from Texas one time on our show years and years ago.
[00:09:39] And he started out selling 300,000 dollar homes.
[00:09:42] And then he eventually got to a place where his average price point was three million.
[00:09:45] And I said, what's the difference in selling a three million dollar home and a
[00:09:50] three hundred thousand dollar home?
[00:09:51] He goes, it's exact same thing.
[00:09:54] He goes, it's just a different clientele.
[00:09:56] And he said, he goes, I realize that at some point in his career.
[00:09:59] Now, now maybe when you get into the higher echelon properties, it is a different process.
[00:10:04] But for 300,000 to three million, he said, he goes, I wish I wouldn't have,
[00:10:09] not that there's anything wrong with, of course, a providing service to 300,000 dollar homes.
[00:10:14] Those are wonderful.
[00:10:14] And in your case, 100 to 200,000 dollar homes and even less.
[00:10:17] But did you find that it was actually a similar amount of effort to sell the million dollar home
[00:10:24] to the athlete versus some of the smaller properties that you were doing?
[00:10:28] It's actually easier because the sellers, it's not their first time around.
[00:10:33] So you don't have to explain what liquid data damages and arbitration is.
[00:10:36] So it's actually easier to transact a multi-million dollar home.
[00:10:42] A harder thing is to actually win the listing.
[00:10:44] That's the challenge because you're competing against great REALTORS.
[00:10:49] There's great REALTORS at all price points, make them say.
[00:10:52] But you're dealing with people that are just more financially stable.
[00:10:57] So again, they've done many deals.
[00:10:59] So that's more competitive.
[00:11:00] So it's difficult to get those listings.
[00:11:02] It's difficult to get those buyers.
[00:11:04] The actual transaction is probably easier than it is selling the entry-level homes.
[00:11:10] That's a really strong point.
[00:11:11] So the competition, of course, would be fierce for those listings.
[00:11:16] What are some of the techniques or the strategies that you would employ
[00:11:22] to separate yourself from other competitors that were also buying for those same deals?
[00:11:28] Well, that's everything.
[00:11:30] DJ, and that's the bulk of my book.
[00:11:33] To be honest with you, I don't sound like a car salesman,
[00:11:35] but my book is there's like seven chapters on that on listing presentation.
[00:11:39] So I'll tell you how I became passionate about that.
[00:11:42] And this is the truth.
[00:11:43] So when I started, my broker at the time told me to pick my geographic farm,
[00:11:49] which was in a city called Knobabark, DoorKnock, give away all the door magnets and
[00:11:54] mopads, and then hopefully you'll get some listing appointments as time goes on.
[00:11:59] So I did everything you told me to do, and then I actually got my first two listing interviews.
[00:12:04] And the difference is I went into those listings and basically did what I was told to do,
[00:12:09] which was talk about comps, price, and about my company.
[00:12:13] But I lost both those listings.
[00:12:15] And both those listings would have paid me about six grand each,
[00:12:18] which would have doubled my net worth.
[00:12:20] It would have gotten me out of my bedroom, my parents' house, and hit me at that moment.
[00:12:24] I'm like, shit, isn't that one hour, that hour and a half window?
[00:12:28] I got to get better.
[00:12:30] I got to win those listings.
[00:12:32] So I dedicated really my whole life at that point to never feeling uncomfortable again,
[00:12:37] never feeling, never, I wanted to have the most confidence I could in a listing interview
[00:12:43] in a presentation.
[00:12:44] So I started create language, went through a bunch of seminars to pick a line here and there,
[00:12:48] but mainly create my own language that would enable me to win.
[00:12:52] That's one my business took off.
[00:12:53] That's when I enjoyed calling expired listings.
[00:12:57] That's when I enjoyed pushing for those listing interviews,
[00:13:00] because I felt I could beat anybody.
[00:13:02] I think the most important skill set a real estate agent can have,
[00:13:07] is a dominant listing presentation, because everybody talks so much about
[00:13:11] lead generation, lead generation, but at the end of the day,
[00:13:15] two or three people are losing those lead opportunities, those listing opportunities.
[00:13:20] I like to, I want to have as much, I want every seller to have as much confidence in me as I
[00:13:25] have in myself that I'm the best REALTOR.
[00:13:28] And that all stems from a powerful listing presentation.
[00:13:32] So that's that's everything.
[00:13:33] That's the tip I give every REALTOR.
[00:13:35] I see, prepare how your listing presentation practice it, be confident in it,
[00:13:42] and truly believe you're the best REALTOR in that interview situation.
[00:13:46] Once you have that skill set,
[00:13:48] real estate becomes fun, and it becomes a whole lot more profitable.
[00:13:52] Yeah, I love that.
[00:13:53] This, it's the Boy Scout motto, always be prepared, right?
[00:13:56] It's this idea of, you know, it is interesting, because listing presentations,
[00:14:00] you know, you'll talk to some, some agents who go a show up with a legal pad,
[00:14:05] with nothing written on it, and I go in blind, right?
[00:14:09] Some people go in with literally no presentation.
[00:14:12] They go in to take notes, and they, and that's one approach.
[00:14:15] And then you have on the extreme other end,
[00:14:18] you know, a multimedia sort of, you know, presentation with slides and various, you know, devices.
[00:14:25] And, you know, it's interesting.
[00:14:27] Everyone does it a bit differently.
[00:14:30] What's, what are your take on the characteristics of a good listing presentation?
[00:14:35] Like, what are some of the things that have to be there?
[00:14:37] And by the way, let's just first address the question,
[00:14:39] the idea of going in with a, with a blank legal pad,
[00:14:43] and, and saying to a seller, all right, let's talk.
[00:14:47] That being a listing presentation, what's your response to people who do that?
[00:14:51] Well, first of all, I was trained when I first started real estate to just talk about price
[00:14:57] and about the company.
[00:14:59] So that's, I get, that's the reason why, you know, I'm very fortunate and humbled to say that I win.
[00:15:05] More, you know, many more times than I lose, because most REALTORS go in unprepared like that.
[00:15:10] So for me, it's, it's about saying, and how you say the same thing that we all do,
[00:15:18] how do you describe, how do you get people excited about photography?
[00:15:23] How do you get people excited about just listed?
[00:15:25] How do you get people excited about social media?
[00:15:27] I call it like my tools, right?
[00:15:29] My tools and my toolbots.
[00:15:31] It's, everybody's going to say, we put your home on Instagram,
[00:15:34] but it's how you explain that to a seller in a powerful way,
[00:15:38] not about how many followers you have,
[00:15:40] but the benefits of that to that seller.
[00:15:43] Every seller, they don't care so much about what you've done in the past.
[00:15:47] They care about what you're going to do for them, right?
[00:15:50] So it's, it's knowing that.
[00:15:52] So explaining all the things you're going to do for them,
[00:15:54] in a very fluid, confident manner, that's going to,
[00:15:58] that's going to be, and then come up, okay, so I'll give you like one of my good minds,
[00:16:03] DJ, right? So I, I, I'd like to think outside of the box all the time.
[00:16:07] So I'll, I'll tell you, because you asked me to do, to give some takeaways, right?
[00:16:11] So I'll give you a couple of takeaways. So, so for me, one of the closest I always do is,
[00:16:15] I say, Mr. Seller, I want you to have the same amount of confidence in me as I have in myself,
[00:16:21] that I am the best real estate agent.
[00:16:22] What I'm going to do is I'm going to talk about everything that I'm going to do for you,
[00:16:26] because really the job of a REALTOR is to maximize the exposure of the home,
[00:16:30] to get as many people as possible to become aware of your home, to truly maximize
[00:16:35] your, the exposure of your property, then get those people excited, screen them,
[00:16:40] vet them, show them properly, and then get them to make the commitment to buy your home.
[00:16:44] That's the job of a REALTOR. I shake my head, yes, and they get, can I'm excited about that?
[00:16:49] Then I say, now I'm going to tell you how I'm going to expose your home to not only real estate
[00:16:55] agents, but to the general public. And then at the end of the day, you have to choose the REALTOR
[00:17:00] that you think is the best one at exposure and of course salesmanship.
[00:17:05] Now, if you say things like that, the way that I just said it with confidence,
[00:17:10] fluid and power, it's, it's pretty hard to beat that, right?
[00:17:14] Versus, oh, let's, let's talk about cops, you know, always push cops to the end, talk about cops.
[00:17:19] You know what I, you know what I love too is, is you, you're meeting the client,
[00:17:23] you're really focusing on what the client's experience of actually choosing a REALTOR is.
[00:17:31] You're not, you're doing something actually quite brilliant because you're saying, hey,
[00:17:34] Mr., Mr. Seller, you're going through this process right now. So I am now on the same side of
[00:17:41] the table as you, because I am repeating back the process you're going through as you're evaluating,
[00:17:47] you know, different REALTOR's. And here's what I'm going to do for you. And I understand this
[00:17:52] is a tough thing for you to figure out who you want to end up using. Here's what I'm going to do for you.
[00:17:56] It's, it's a subtle little thing that you added in there that was brilliant because it puts you
[00:18:01] on the same side of the table as that you're like, yeah, I get it. You're, you're interviewing people.
[00:18:05] Here's what I'm going to do. And here's what, you know, how to make the best decision. I love that.
[00:18:09] That was subtle, but brilliant.
[00:18:11] Thanks, thanks. I also say like, but I appreciate the opportunity to interview for the,
[00:18:15] for the job of working for you. I never say working with you. I cringe when REALTOR say that
[00:18:21] all the time, oh, I'm so excited to work with you. And, and, but it's not the case. They're hiring us
[00:18:26] to do a job to work for them to sell their home. So I say that, put my ego aside. I say, Mr. Seller,
[00:18:32] and I say it all the time. Thanks again for the opportunity to interview for the job, to work for
[00:18:36] you. Thanks for the opportunity to be an honor to work for you and I say that because I still think
[00:18:41] human nature is people like to hear that. They like to hear it because it's the truth, especially
[00:18:45] people that aren't a boss. They like to hear that they're hiring somebody and they are the boss.
[00:18:50] So all even one of the lines that I say, this is pretty good because I use this all the time.
[00:18:54] I think a lot of REALTORS can can take this line alone and say, I say, Mr. Job, Mr. Seller,
[00:19:01] kind of like an agent for an athlete, an agent's job for an athlete is to not only negotiate the
[00:19:06] contracts, but to get their clients that off the field money. Athletes love that pizza hut
[00:19:12] money. They want that shoe deal. They want all that. So a great sports agent is going to be on the
[00:19:17] phone all day promoting their clients to get them that off the field thing. It's the same with me.
[00:19:24] I'm a real estate agent. The difference is I'm on the phone all day promoting my star, which is your
[00:19:29] house, your house is my star. So a good real estate agent is like a good sports agent or a good movie
[00:19:36] where behind the scenes and we're promoting our stars, which is your house. So your house will be my
[00:19:42] star. And I'm going to spend all day, every day that I can to promote your home to get people
[00:19:46] excited about your own. That again, if you say that properly is a very powerful listing line,
[00:19:53] not line, but fact, but it's a powerful and relatable thing for a seller to hear.
[00:19:58] This episode of Keeping It Real is brought to you by Madwell. We've all been there. You can see
[00:20:05] the potential of an outdated property, but your buyer can't and the opportunity is lost. You
[00:20:10] wish you could snap your fingers and transform the space. And now you can with Madwell. Now listen
[00:20:15] up, this visionary team with years of experience in real estate, architecture, design and prop tech,
[00:20:22] built Madwell's 3D enhanced listing technology to digitally reimagine a property so you can show
[00:20:28] your buyer the stunning possibilities in real time and inspire action. Madwell visually transforms
[00:20:34] high-end homes as well as new developments to move prospects quickly. Josh on Million Dollar
[00:20:40] listing used Madwell's 3D listing tech to reimagine an outdated 1930s home and went from zero
[00:20:46] showings to 23 book showings and two offers in just 10 days. That's impressive, right? Now you might
[00:20:53] be thinking, I already get renderings done. Well, this is nothing like that. This is next level
[00:20:58] interactive 3D like you've never seen and you must see it to get the full picture. I couldn't
[00:21:04] wait to try it myself and really honestly the demo blew me away. I want you guys to experience
[00:21:09] Madwell and transform your properties. So I asked them to do something special just for our listeners
[00:21:14] and they came through with a $250 credit on your first enhanced 3D listing. Just use our special
[00:21:22] link livemodwell.com forward slash real. Again, that's livemodwell.com forward slash real.
[00:21:30] Choose them for your very next listing. Help your clients see the future and now on to our show.
[00:21:38] You're absolutely right. Everybody wants a concierge experience as a consumer, right? We want
[00:21:45] the the top level high white glove experience as a consumer. But we don't often get that unless we
[00:21:55] happen to be wealthy enough to have some of those experiences. But everybody wants the experience,
[00:22:00] whether they ever get to have them or not and what you're really doing is you're bringing that
[00:22:05] top top shelf white glove service to all of your clients and you're treating them all is equal,
[00:22:12] but you're treating them all as if they are the most important client in the room or in your
[00:22:18] which of course they need to be for or need to feel that way about you. And I think I think that
[00:22:25] is a really, really smart way is to make sure that the that your seller is actually you know what
[00:22:32] their needs are emotionally so that you can be there to support them. Yeah, that's a good point too.
[00:22:38] That's strong. Yeah, I totally agree with that. In the interview, real estate is very competitive.
[00:22:46] DJ, there's more REALTORS than there are listings. I think the last that I heard there's twice as many
[00:22:51] REALTORS as there are real estate agents. So it's incredible. So the better skill set you have
[00:22:57] of being able to walk into a room and interview against two or three other REALTORS,
[00:23:03] someone's going to get that listing, someone's going to get paid. So the more powerful your
[00:23:08] presentation is going to be the better you're going to win. For example, I never talk about price
[00:23:13] until the end. When I first started, I was trained to talk about price in the beginning by a big
[00:23:18] trainer and he says, if you can't agree on the price, get out of there. You have more listings to do,
[00:23:23] you have more phone calls to make, you have more prospecting to do. So if you can't agree on the
[00:23:27] price, if you have an illogical seller get out. Well, then what would happen is I would see that. I
[00:23:32] did that. So I would go and talk about price couldn't come to an agreement on the price and I'd leave.
[00:23:37] And then I'd see that property actually come on the market at a right price. And I questioned myself.
[00:23:41] I said, right. How come I didn't pray? And then I realized I wasn't giving them any reason to
[00:23:47] listen to me, to believe in me, to switch. So now I give my powerful listing presentation
[00:23:54] always before I talk about the price. I want to establish the credibility, DJ. I want them to go.
[00:24:01] My goal on every listing interview is to not to have them want to hire me, but to have them
[00:24:06] need to hire me to accomplish their goals or at least believe they need me. They need a guy like me
[00:24:12] to maximize the exposure and to get their own soul for their money. Once I could get that and I
[00:24:18] could see it in their eyes, I could hear it in their voice, I got them. This is mine. Then they're
[00:24:23] going to listen to me better and respect my my valuation of the price of their own. They're going
[00:24:29] to respect my opinion once they trust me and the way to earn that trust is by delivering a great
[00:24:34] presentation. And you've done your point. How we doing? How we doing? Man, we doing amazing.
[00:24:40] Doing amazing, by the way, because my mind is just being flooded because there's so many
[00:24:46] REALTORS that will show up to a listing presentation. And maybe they don't feel that there's a lot
[00:24:53] of competition. Maybe there isn't competition in this particular listing presentation. So they'll
[00:24:57] say things like, well, okay, what price point do you want, Mr. Mr. Mrs. Celler? Okay, well,
[00:25:02] we want to sell it at X. Okay, well, we can try to X and let's see what happens. You don't go
[00:25:09] you know the price point you want. And you're not really worried about the price because what
[00:25:13] because you are the expert, you need to first defend and impress upon them what all of the
[00:25:21] accrued all of the sort of reasons why they should trust you. The price is going to work itself out
[00:25:27] once they trust you because your whole mission is so that's really, really smart. As price is
[00:25:33] at the very, very end, I love that. I think that it's brilliant. It's the truth. In fact, if I,
[00:25:39] if I'm not even have to compete with another REALTOR, so if a seller says, Hey, Jordan, I'm not
[00:25:43] even interviewing anybody else. You're the number one guy in the county, obviously the top guy in
[00:25:47] our area. You're a good referral. All our friends have said you're great. All this kind of stuff.
[00:25:53] You don't even have to interview. We just want to come and basically come list me, right? I got
[00:25:59] to tell you, DJ, I still do my presentation. It's a 30 minute investment for me to be able to
[00:26:06] have them respect what we do as REALTORS. We work our asses off, right? I want to invest money.
[00:26:13] Notice I didn't say spend money, invest money. We invest time, money, passion, and energy
[00:26:19] to properly expose a home and get all them sold. So I want them to know that because I know I'm
[00:26:25] going to have more control of the escrow. I'm going to have more control on the inspection process,
[00:26:30] and I'm more control on the pricing. So I still want them to go, wow, I didn't realize you were
[00:26:35] going to do this that and the other to work, you know, to benefit me and the ability to sell my
[00:26:40] home. So thank you. So I give my presentation always, even if I don't have to, I give it. I know a
[00:26:45] lot of REALTORS are hearing this going, why would you do that? Why would you spend 30 minutes? I
[00:26:49] just explained why because it helps you on their respect even more. And it's professional.
[00:26:55] And we're in a professional environment. And even if it's your best friend who's going to be your
[00:27:00] client, treat him like a white glove. Look, if I walk into, let's just say like the Waldorf
[00:27:06] Astoria, which I once in a blue moon, I get to go to a place like that. It's a different experience
[00:27:12] than walking into a lower priced hotel, right? There, there is an experiential component to this
[00:27:18] that you that that top places have. Jordan has that and he applies it to all of his clients.
[00:27:25] And that is absolutely brilliant because of course, going back to our earlier point, everybody
[00:27:30] wants to feel special and important. Actually treat them as if they are because, no, guess what
[00:27:35] they are. They actually are important. You know, I love the fact that you just said the word
[00:27:39] professional. I asked myself that I could ask my assistants every day. So is this professional?
[00:27:44] Is this look professional? I don't put my picture on anything. Do you have to put my picture on
[00:27:48] ads? I don't put my picture on on my signs. I don't put my picture on anything because I always say
[00:27:53] to myself, when the day comes, that lawyers start doing that or doctors start putting their picture
[00:27:58] on their cards and things like that. I get some do. Then I want to do that. I want to make,
[00:28:02] I want to build my brand as professional classes like you. So that's amazing. So I tried to be as
[00:28:08] professional as I can clean lines, everything clean and versus like a, you know, you're never
[00:28:14] going to see a picture of me holding my dog in real estate advertising or pretending like I'm on
[00:28:18] the phone. You know, nothing that just kind of looks, you know, to me, doesn't look as professional.
[00:28:23] It's just a classy one. So that's it. And everyone knows by now how inauthentic it is.
[00:28:30] When you drive, you know, down, you know, in your case, you know, you drive in on PCH or whatever,
[00:28:34] and there's a billboard with a, you know, with a lawyer with his sleeve rolled up going,
[00:28:39] I'm going to fight for you when he's showing you his bicep and you're like, yeah, okay, we get it.
[00:28:42] We understand. I want to see you in the suit, though, when you get into the courtroom. But, uh,
[00:28:49] let's talk about, you know, we were so quick to shoe old ideas for how to, you know, old sales ideas,
[00:28:57] old marketing ideas. And I love the fact that you have actually taken some old techniques and
[00:29:03] actually made them not new again, but made them important again. And the fun, we're talking about
[00:29:08] fundamentals. So I'd love to hear how you've taken some older ideas and made them into sort of
[00:29:13] cutting edge strategies. Oh, 100% of DJI. I, that's exactly what I do, man. I take time tested,
[00:29:22] stuff that is work for, you know, decades and decades and decades. I just explain it better.
[00:29:27] And I like to think that I use it better and I elevate it. So for example, that's a great question,
[00:29:34] just list it, right? So every REALTOR will do a just listed, right? It helps build your geographical
[00:29:39] farm and all that kind of stuff. But how do you explain those on a listing presentation? So I'll tell
[00:29:45] you what I do. So first of all, I elevate it. So the way I got established in my farm and I continue
[00:29:50] to stay ahead of the curve in my marketing area, even like competing against great REALTORS, I say,
[00:29:55] ahead, I do it bigger and better. I do different shapes, different sizes, better quality card stop.
[00:30:00] But then it's the way I explain it on a listing presentation. So I'll say to a specialist,
[00:30:05] Mr. Seller. So the job of REALTORS to maximize the exposure, we need to cast a wide net. So in order
[00:30:11] to cast a wide net, I'm going to blow it up with print, I'm going to blow it up with social
[00:30:16] medium and blow it up with email class and all the other good stuff that I do to blow it up
[00:30:21] internationally and nationally. However, sometimes the buyer's going to come from drug,
[00:30:27] just drop in the line in the water. And the way I'm going to do that is these epic elevated
[00:30:32] just listed brochures. Notice I don't say postcards because it's not just a cheap postcard
[00:30:37] that someone's going to throw away. I like to invest in elevating it. So hopefully a buyer that
[00:30:45] isn't online all day every day searching Seller for a home actually lives in your area or one of
[00:30:50] my other that's also on my my mail list that isn't on the on the computer all day every day,
[00:30:57] you know, just swiping through Zillow, but they've always said, you know, if the right house,
[00:31:01] if that single story home with the pool and the view, which is what you have, Mr. Seller,
[00:31:06] comes across my desk or in my mailbox, I'm open to making that move. So what I want to do is I want
[00:31:12] to mail these incredible brochures to pass clients, sports agents, business managers, relocation
[00:31:17] companies and all your neighbors so they can open it up, knock throw it away so quick and say,
[00:31:24] man, honey, we love this neighborhood or our friends want to move in this neighborhood, isn't this
[00:31:30] the exact house that we would want to buy. So some but they're not again, they're not on Zillow all day
[00:31:36] every day. Open up the mail and they see something beautiful like this and I could show it to a
[00:31:41] seller. I can hand it to them. It's something that C field touch and appreciate. Don't you think
[00:31:47] there's a small chance, any chance that there's a buyer that lives right around the corner from you
[00:31:52] that'd be interested in your single story pool with a view home and they say, yeah, and I say so it's
[00:31:59] my job. The job of a REALTOR is to bring your home to them, not just hope that they find your home.
[00:32:05] So that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to bring your home to people. So that's an old
[00:32:10] trick, the old listing just listed, but if you do them right and you elevate it and you explain
[00:32:16] them in a listing interview, you're going to win. You're going to sound like an expert. What I say
[00:32:21] makes sense. There's some side benefits to it, building your geographical farm, just representing the
[00:32:27] homes well, representing yourself well, representing your industry and your business classy. But in
[00:32:34] reality, I sell homes every year as a direct result of those alone. Oh my gosh. You just said,
[00:32:41] so much there. I'm so impressed. I think there's a lot of our listeners that, you know, look,
[00:32:48] guys, this isn't a criticism of anyone listening. I'm certainly a good fall prey to this as well.
[00:32:55] But let's remember when we get a listing, it's not enough just to drop it onto the MLS and let it
[00:33:00] syndicate out all over online and hope that someone stumbles across it. What Jordan is talking about
[00:33:06] is going, oh yeah, yeah, no, I'm going to do that. But that's just like maybe the maybe step one.
[00:33:12] And then I've got 25 other steps that I'm going to do to continue to cast a net and shoot this
[00:33:18] out to neighbors. I know which neighborhoods feed into this neighborhood. I know where the people
[00:33:23] who want to live here now where they're currently living. I am going to send them a postcard to tell
[00:33:28] them about this postcard. I'm sorry. I'm really sure. I'm really sure. Yeah, it's an investment
[00:33:36] not not a giant, you know, even though some might do that. But it's a it's something that's not
[00:33:42] so easy to throw away. But what you do is you're pulling your name as well as trying to sell the
[00:33:48] home. But even more than that, it's a hell of a listing tool. If you use them, it's amazing.
[00:33:54] And you say what I say, you will win listings just that way alone. That's just one of my tools.
[00:34:02] The guys, the book is the agent's edge secret strategies to win listings and make your fortune
[00:34:06] selling real estate available everywhere. Books are sold. We'll have a link to it in the show notes.
[00:34:10] Jordan, you are absolutely right. But this idea of when you get a listing, everyone listening,
[00:34:15] you have to go out and find the buyers and you have to tell the seller how you were going to do
[00:34:21] that. And Jordan is the king of doing that. He just basically is the king, the king of that.
[00:34:28] And really think think about how powerful that is. Most REALTORS don't really do that. They'll say,
[00:34:34] well, we'll put it online and it'll get distributed in every realtoral, see it and they'll tell
[00:34:38] their clients what Jordan does is he goes, I know exactly where people who move who want to
[00:34:44] live in this. I know where they live now. And I'm going to make sure that they know that this
[00:34:48] place is available for sale. He did his homework. He knows his market. He is the king of his
[00:34:53] market because he knows where people want to live. And he goes out and says, hey, the reason why
[00:34:58] he wins listings and he's the number one remex guy in the world is he has a solution to all of the
[00:35:04] issues that may come up during the listing. He's like, don't worry, I know where the people that are
[00:35:08] going to buy this place probably live right now. I'm going to go over to them and make sure they
[00:35:12] know about it. Brilliant. That is a brilliant strategy for any homeowner. That's all a homeowner
[00:35:17] wants to hear is where are you going to find the buyer? And most listing agents go, well, we'll put
[00:35:22] it up. We'll see what happens. Yeah. Thank you, man. These are from the bottom of my heart. Thank
[00:35:26] you for sending all those great stuff, man. It's truly, truly appreciated. In fact, I'm kind of the
[00:35:33] anti-internet. So what I say is I say, Mr. Sellers, of course you're going to be on Zillow.
[00:35:39] Of course you're going to be on Realizer.com in Julia. Those are automatic polls. There's no question
[00:35:45] about it. In fact, I buy the upgraded packages because, yeah, the internet is a great way to
[00:35:51] market seller home. But we only have 30 to 45 to an hour here for me to convince you that I am
[00:35:59] the best. And the way I'm going to do that is tell you everything I do above and beyond the internet
[00:36:04] and above and beyond and better than the internet. But please know, of course you're going to be on
[00:36:09] Zillow with me as you would be with any other Realizer. I just want you to appreciate
[00:36:14] even more that I'm going to do to try to land that fire. And then I go through my series of
[00:36:19] marketing tools. And just listen, just one of them. Of course, I got many more that I talk about
[00:36:24] in the book for sure. It's incredible. It's really treating this. I get very excited talking to you
[00:36:30] because you take this very seriously. You have a, you are prepared. This, you don't wing,
[00:36:38] this is a performance. It is important. Right. When you're very scientific,
[00:36:43] yeah, of course, of course it is. And, and it is so impressive. I love hearing. And, and, you know,
[00:36:50] it's so funny because this is, this is how we distinguish people who are, you know, professionals
[00:36:56] from non professionals in this industry. And, and people who are successful tend to be very
[00:37:01] methodical. And it is, it is mostly about, you know, thinking three to four steps ahead, like,
[00:37:06] you know, this idea of coming, you already know the price point. I'm sure that you think is
[00:37:12] best. You're going to take that at the very, very end after you've already built so much rapport.
[00:37:17] And so much, you've even pressed upon them so much of your knowledge that they are now bought into
[00:37:24] you. It's that they're buying into your philosophy. And from there, then you can kind of steer the
[00:37:29] ship. Is it, do I have that right? Yeah, totally, totally get it. Yeah, absolutely. It's very
[00:37:34] methodical. That was a great word that you said. And, and for sure. And again, this is just like one
[00:37:39] part of the book, right? It's the listing presentation. I dive into how to turn open houses into
[00:37:45] listing opportunities, not just to pick up buyers, how to get listing interviews from I, I, I,
[00:37:50] I'm very, I talk a lot about pricing at a properly priced with language to use to try to control
[00:37:55] that aspect of not controls nothing necessarily the word, but to earn the respect when it comes to
[00:38:02] pricing. I like to think I, and I'd protect your commission. That's something I'm very proud of
[00:38:07] is how I present my full commission. I'm proud to say that I am a full commission agent. I earn
[00:38:13] that. And it's what I say that how, how would I go about that? I love it. What, what prompted you
[00:38:21] to want to write a book and, and give this out to this information out to other agents?
[00:38:26] To great question, man. I, I was selling a home to an agent from CAA, so creative artist,
[00:38:33] because of the big, big moving agent. And I sold him a home in my area, that I work called
[00:38:39] North Ranch Area of West Lake Village. And I sold him a home there. And then I listed his home,
[00:38:43] Holly with Hills. And he goes, Hey, man, you're so good at this. You ought to write a book. You ever
[00:38:47] thought about that? And I go, thank you. I go, I actually have. I thought about writing.
[00:38:52] I've been doing this for 33 years, DJ. I'm at the point of my career where I actually like,
[00:38:57] you know, help another REALTOR's. It's not a, it's not a corny thing. It's just, I dig it. Like,
[00:39:03] I, I replied every DM and email and call it. If I could help somebody make more money, it's,
[00:39:08] it's a good thing. And I feel good about that. So I actually said, I've been thinking about that. He
[00:39:13] goes, can I connect you with one of our literary agents? Oh, man, you kidding me. Of course.
[00:39:18] So I did a zoom with the literary agent, a man that he was, hey, and then he asked if he, he
[00:39:24] loved, we got along beautifully. He said, man, I love this idea. This book. It's a business book.
[00:39:31] How to sell real estate? Remember, DJ, this isn't a motivation book. I don't tell anybody to drink
[00:39:35] juice, exercise, or a vision board. It's not an energy book. None of that kind of stuff. This
[00:39:41] is a how to sell real estate book for real estate agents. So he said, so he said, we love to
[00:39:46] represent you. That was a win beyond DJ. I couldn't wait to tell my wife that I, I, I, I,
[00:39:52] go, wait a minute. You tell me I have been agent because you, man, I'm, I'm a REALTOR. I've never
[00:39:55] been on that side of the table. You work with agents. Yeah, man. I've never been on that side of
[00:39:59] the table. So he said, absolutely. So I got excited. And then you write a treatment, but what the
[00:40:04] book would look like. So I did that. And that took me a long time because I wanted to be really good.
[00:40:09] And then the agent took that and he put it out to all the publishers. I had multiple offers.
[00:40:15] And I signed with Harper Collins leadership because I just loved, you know, Tim,
[00:40:20] and Sicily, who are the Harper Collins team, the leadership team. And we took it from there.
[00:40:26] Then I had a great collaborator to help me put this in paper named Mark Tab. And we wrote a
[00:40:32] phenomenal book that I'm very proud of. And the review, by the way, today is a very special day.
[00:40:37] DJ today is launch day. So all the people that have been preordering it. And there's
[00:40:41] thousands of them over the past few months to receive their books today. So I'm already getting some
[00:40:47] amazing reviews. And it's a very, very problem moment for me. It's June 6th. And I'm very grateful
[00:40:54] and humbled by all the great reviews. So that's how the book came about. And I wrote it and I'm proud of it.
[00:40:58] Well, the book is called agents edge, seek its strategies to win listings and make your fortune
[00:41:04] selling real estate. And it is available literally everywhere that books are sold Amazon.
[00:41:11] Of course, Barnes and Noble target online. Of course, everywhere Walmart is too. So please,
[00:41:17] everyone go out and get their book. We'll have a link to the Amazon store for the book right in
[00:41:22] our show notes. One last question, Jordan, for you. Just out of curiosity. What's the most satisfying
[00:41:29] part of being a REALTOR for you? Obviously you do this. You've worked on the smallest of
[00:41:37] starter homes to polatial states. What is it that what do you enjoy the most about being a REALTOR?
[00:41:46] I DJ, you want the truth or you want the corny bullshit answer? I want the truth. The best part
[00:41:53] is going to the bank after it closes, man. If you've done, they put that money in the bank. That's
[00:41:58] the best part, man. Listen, I've been doing this a long time. I just want to save as much money as I
[00:42:03] can so someday I can slow myself down. I love moving people. I love having happy buyers and happy
[00:42:10] sellers and watching people accomplish their goals. I love it. But for me personally, the best part is
[00:42:16] when the deal closes and I get paid. And I think I hope a lot of REALTOR that are listening to this
[00:42:22] go, man, I'm glad he said that because I think we're all in agreement. It's very easy for a REALTOR
[00:42:26] to say, oh, I don't care at all about that. I just want to make people happy. Well, that's fine and
[00:42:32] dandy. But at the end of the day, we got a job to do, man. And I want to do as well as I can.
[00:42:38] So that's that's my happy moment is when it closes and I get a congratulate people and get that check.
[00:42:44] That's the happiest moment for me. That's the truth. That's the truth. I'm losing you. I'm losing you.
[00:42:53] You're cutting out a little bit. Say that one more time. Sorry, guys. Yeah, I, I, I love that.
[00:42:58] Jordan, thank you. I know we're having some tactical difficulties. We'll get that worked out. Sorry about
[00:43:06] so sorry about that. But absolutely a group.
[00:43:12] Ah, dang. I can't hear you at all. You've closed.
[00:43:20] Let's see, Jordan, if I can get better hang on one sec. Sorry. Sorry about that. Oh, that's okay.
[00:43:27] I'm an incleror now. Now I got you. It's a little bit better now. Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[00:43:32] Okay. Sorry. I don't know what's going on here. That was awesome. And I love that. And I
[00:43:38] appreciate that. And of course, that's the best part is going, you know, getting paid and going to
[00:43:43] the bank. And it's, it's something that, you know, we shouldn't pretend it's not the, like a lot of
[00:43:49] times people will say, uh, everything but that, right? They'll say, oh, it's about helping people.
[00:43:55] And of course it is that too. But we don't, we don't tend to celebrate the financial part of it.
[00:44:00] And why are we in this business if we don't want to celebrate the financial part? Yeah, yeah. I mean,
[00:44:04] I really love when, when people close and close in a big one today. And I'm excited about that.
[00:44:09] Close and big one today at the name drop. I don't mind name drop it for Brett Michaels, you know,
[00:44:14] from poison man. Of course, sure. I love, I get, I get a representative on a ton of deals. I love
[00:44:19] them every deal and with that guy. It's all about good karma, right? So I'm closing a good karma
[00:44:25] deal today. And it's a very exciting for me. So man, I love to see him happy. I love to see the
[00:44:31] fire of his home happy. I love everybody to be happy. But I'm going to be the happiest when I go
[00:44:36] to the bank at the end of the day and make my deposit. You can rock a red bandana to closing.
[00:44:42] As Brett is known to do. That's amazing, amazing. Jordan Cohen is new book is called the

So Jordan Cohen, what do we have a link to all of that in the show notes? Jordan, welcome to the show. Man, DJ, that was a hell of an introduction, man. I appreciate it so much. Thank you. You're a hell of a guest or excited to have you. I'm very grateful and humbled that you said such kind stuff, man. So thank you from bottom of my heart. Well, thank you for making time for our show and our audience. We appreciate it. And you are known as a guy at the top of the RE/MAX mountain. But our audience is always interested in hearing how people climb the mountain first. So I would be curious to know how did you get into real estate? Was it something you always knew that you wanted to do? Or was this like a career change? So love to hear that story. Oh, okay. Sounds good, DJ. So no, I was kind of the opposite of what I wanted to do. Because my parents had done it, but they kind of struggled. They were always kind of deal to deal when I was growing up. So it was kind of the opposite. But I was a terrible student. I graduated from college with a 2.05 GPA. I cheated my way through. And therefore, when I graduated, I didn't have any big corporations, not to down my door or anything like that. So the only thing I had going for me, I thought was a good personality. So I knew I would go into some sort of sales. But in truth, I wanted to be an insurance guy. Because I wanted to be opposite of real estate. So I wanted to be insurance, but then there was a guy named Jim that worked out at the gym that I worked out at. And he carried business cards in the socks. And he walked around, everybody scattered away from him. Because he was Jim the insurance guy. Brut, so I said, I don't want to be that guy. That just went up to people who was trying to sell insurance. And there's anything wrong with insurance. We all need it, but I didn't want to be that guy. People ran from. So basically, what I did was I started a little business when I was in college called Property Promotions, where I did will say, advertise for my parents or for other REALTORS. So I saw, I met all the REALTORS in the San Fernando Valley where I'm from. And most of them kind of struggled, but there was a few that did well. And there was one guy that in those days, we're going back 33, 34 years ago. There was one guy that was the number one guy who was making 400 grand a year. His broker told me that. That's more than NFL players made. I didn't know anybody can make that kind of money. Huge money. Huge money. So I was like, oh, shit. Real estate isn't such a bad thing, man. So I went into real estate right after college. Once I learned that somebody could actually make that kind of money, I started an entry-level housing. My ever sales price was under 200,000. For the first seven years of my career, it was 150,000, 200,000. You know, I even did a many deals under 100,000. And then after about seven years, I got my first pro athlete. And he said, hey, man, he just signed with the Philadelphia 76ers and he goes, hey, man, let's look in West Lake Village. Now, you gotta remember, this was before the internet DJ. So I didn't really, I'd never even been to West Lake Village. I didn't even know where it was. And he goes, hey, I think there's some, you know, a million dollar gargated communities. I go, oh, man, there's some amazing gargated communities. I had no idea, DJ. I didn't even know where West Lake was. So I went out there, I quickly learned that there were some gargated communities. I did that first deal with him, which was, I think it was around a million and a half dollars. And I got that lottery money. I'd never seen a paycheck like that. But for me, the interesting thing was I met all the REALTOR's that were selling these million dollar homes DJ. And they were all very nice. But I remember, they can man, they're not any better than just because they're selling million dollar homes. And I'm selling 200,000 dollar homes. I thought I could compete with them. So I did that deal. I packed up my shit. I told my wife, we were just married, we've been married for 30 years. I said, man, these people can sell million dollar homes. I think I could do it too. So I packed up and started all over. It is interesting. I remember I talked to a guy from Texas one time on our show years and years ago. And he started out selling 300,000 dollar homes. And then he eventually got to a place where his average price point was three million. And I said, what's the difference in selling a three million dollar home and a three hundred thousand dollar home? He goes, it's exact same thing. He goes, it's just a different clientele. And he said, he goes, I realize that at some point in his career. Now, now maybe when you get into the higher echelon properties, it is a different process. But for 300,000 to three million, he said, he goes, I wish I wouldn't have, not that there's anything wrong with, of course, a providing service to 300,000 dollar homes. Those are wonderful. And in your case, 100 to 200,000 dollar homes and even less. But did you find that it was actually a similar amount of effort to sell the million dollar home to the athlete versus some of the smaller properties that you were doing? It's actually easier because the sellers, it's not their first time around. So you don't have to explain what liquid data damages and arbitration is. So it's actually easier to transact a multi-million dollar home. A harder thing is to actually win the listing. That's the challenge because you're competing against great REALTORS. There's great REALTORS at all price points, make them say. But you're dealing with people that are just more financially stable. So again, they've done many deals. So that's more competitive. So it's difficult to get those listings. It's difficult to get those buyers. The actual transaction is probably easier than it is selling the entry-level homes. That's a really strong point. So the competition, of course, would be fierce for those listings. What are some of the techniques or the strategies that you would employ to separate yourself from other competitors that were also buying for those same deals? Well, that's everything. DJ, and that's the bulk of my book. To be honest with you, I don't sound like a car salesman, but my book is there's like seven chapters on that on listing presentation. So I'll tell you how I became passionate about that. And this is the truth. So when I started, my broker at the time told me to pick my geographic farm, which was in a city called Knobabark, DoorKnock, give away all the door magnets and mopads, and then hopefully you'll get some listing appointments as time goes on. So I did everything you told me to do, and then I actually got my first two listing interviews. And the difference is I went into those listings and basically did what I was told to do, which was talk about comps, price, and about my company. But I lost both those listings. And both those listings would have paid me about six grand each, which would have doubled my net worth. It would have gotten me out of my bedroom, my parents' house, and hit me at that moment. I'm like, shit, isn't that one hour, that hour and a half window? I got to get better. I got to win those listings. So I dedicated really my whole life at that point to never feeling uncomfortable again, never feeling, never, I wanted to have the most confidence I could in a listing interview in a presentation. So I started create language, went through a bunch of seminars to pick a line here and there, but mainly create my own language that would enable me to win. That's one my business took off. That's when I enjoyed calling expired listings. That's when I enjoyed pushing for those listing interviews, because I felt I could beat anybody. I think the most important skill set a real estate agent can have, is a dominant listing presentation, because everybody talks so much about lead generation, lead generation, but at the end of the day, two or three people are losing those lead opportunities, those listing opportunities. I like to, I want to have as much, I want every seller to have as much confidence in me as I have in myself that I'm the best REALTOR. And that all stems from a powerful listing presentation. So that's that's everything. That's the tip I give every REALTOR. I see, prepare how your listing presentation practice it, be confident in it, and truly believe you're the best REALTOR in that interview situation. Once you have that skill set, real estate becomes fun, and it becomes a whole lot more profitable. Yeah, I love that. This, it's the Boy Scout motto, always be prepared, right? It's this idea of, you know, it is interesting, because listing presentations, you know, you'll talk to some, some agents who go a show up with a legal pad, with nothing written on it, and I go in blind, right? Some people go in with literally no presentation. They go in to take notes, and they, and that's one approach. And then you have on the extreme other end, you know, a multimedia sort of, you know, presentation with slides and various, you know, devices. And, you know, it's interesting. Everyone does it a bit differently. What's, what are your take on the characteristics of a good listing presentation? Like, what are some of the things that have to be there? And by the way, let's just first address the question, the idea of going in with a, with a blank legal pad, and, and saying to a seller, all right, let's talk. That being a listing presentation, what's your response to people who do that? Well, first of all, I was trained when I first started real estate to just talk about price and about the company. So that's, I get, that's the reason why, you know, I'm very fortunate and humbled to say that I win. More, you know, many more times than I lose, because most REALTORS go in unprepared like that. So for me, it's, it's about saying, and how you say the same thing that we all do, how do you describe, how do you get people excited about photography? How do you get people excited about just listed? How do you get people excited about social media? I call it like my tools, right? My tools and my toolbots. It's, everybody's going to say, we put your home on Instagram, but it's how you explain that to a seller in a powerful way, not about how many followers you have, but the benefits of that to that seller. Every seller, they don't care so much about what you've done in the past. They care about what you're going to do for them, right? So it's, it's knowing that. So explaining all the things you're going to do for them, in a very fluid, confident manner, that's going to, that's going to be, and then come up, okay, so I'll give you like one of my good minds, DJ, right? So I, I, I'd like to think outside of the box all the time. So I'll, I'll tell you, because you asked me to do, to give some takeaways, right? So I'll give you a couple of takeaways. So, so for me, one of the closest I always do is, I say, Mr. Seller, I want you to have the same amount of confidence in me as I have in myself, that I am the best real estate agent. What I'm going to do is I'm going to talk about everything that I'm going to do for you, because really the job of a REALTOR is to maximize the exposure of the home, to get as many people as possible to become aware of your home, to truly maximize your, the exposure of your property, then get those people excited, screen them, vet them, show them properly, and then get them to make the commitment to buy your home. That's the job of a REALTOR. I shake my head, yes, and they get, can I'm excited about that? Then I say, now I'm going to tell you how I'm going to expose your home to not only real estate agents, but to the general public. And then at the end of the day, you have to choose the REALTOR that you think is the best one at exposure and of course salesmanship. Now, if you say things like that, the way that I just said it with confidence, fluid and power, it's, it's pretty hard to beat that, right? Versus, oh, let's, let's talk about cops, you know, always push cops to the end, talk about cops. You know what I, you know what I love too is, is you, you're meeting the client, you're really focusing on what the client's experience of actually choosing a REALTOR is. You're not, you're doing something actually quite brilliant because you're saying, hey, Mr., Mr. Seller, you're going through this process right now. So I am now on the same side of the table as you, because I am repeating back the process you're going through as you're evaluating, you know, different REALTOR's. And here's what I'm going to do for you. And I understand this is a tough thing for you to figure out who you want to end up using. Here's what I'm going to do for you. It's, it's a subtle little thing that you added in there that was brilliant because it puts you on the same side of the table as that you're like, yeah, I get it. You're, you're interviewing people. Here's what I'm going to do. And here's what, you know, how to make the best decision. I love that. That was subtle, but brilliant. Thanks, thanks. I also say like, but I appreciate the opportunity to interview for the, for the job of working for you. I never say working with you. I cringe when REALTOR say that all the time, oh, I'm so excited to work with you. And, and, but it's not the case. They're hiring us to do a job to work for them to sell their home. So I say that, put my ego aside. I say, Mr. Seller, and I say it all the time. Thanks again for the opportunity to interview for the job, to work for you. Thanks for the opportunity to be an honor to work for you and I say that because I still think human nature is people like to hear that. They like to hear it because it's the truth, especially people that aren't a boss. They like to hear that they're hiring somebody and they are the boss. So all even one of the lines that I say, this is pretty good because I use this all the time. I think a lot of REALTORS can can take this line alone and say, I say, Mr. Job, Mr. Seller, kind of like an agent for an athlete, an agent's job for an athlete is to not only negotiate the contracts, but to get their clients that off the field money. Athletes love that pizza hut money. They want that shoe deal. They want all that. So a great sports agent is going to be on the phone all day promoting their clients to get them that off the field thing. It's the same with me. I'm a real estate agent. The difference is I'm on the phone all day promoting my star, which is your house, your house is my star. So a good real estate agent is like a good sports agent or a good movie where behind the scenes and we're promoting our stars, which is your house. So your house will be my star. And I'm going to spend all day, every day that I can to promote your home to get people excited about your own. That again, if you say that properly is a very powerful listing line, not line, but fact, but it's a powerful and relatable thing for a seller to hear.

Help your clients see the future and now on to our show. You're absolutely right. Everybody wants a concierge experience as a consumer, right? We want the the top level high white glove experience as a consumer. But we don't often get that unless we happen to be wealthy enough to have some of those experiences. But everybody wants the experience, whether they ever get to have them or not and what you're really doing is you're bringing that top top shelf white glove service to all of your clients and you're treating them all is equal, but you're treating them all as if they are the most important client in the room or in your which of course they need to be for or need to feel that way about you. And I think I think that is a really, really smart way is to make sure that the that your seller is actually you know what their needs are emotionally so that you can be there to support them. Yeah, that's a good point too. That's strong. Yeah, I totally agree with that. In the interview, real estate is very competitive. DJ, there's more REALTORS than there are listings. I think the last that I heard there's twice as many REALTORS as there are real estate agents. So it's incredible. So the better skill set you have of being able to walk into a room and interview against two or three other REALTORS, someone's going to get that listing, someone's going to get paid. So the more powerful your presentation is going to be the better you're going to win. For example, I never talk about price until the end. When I first started, I was trained to talk about price in the beginning by a big trainer and he says, if you can't agree on the price, get out of there. You have more listings to do, you have more phone calls to make, you have more prospecting to do. So if you can't agree on the price, if you have an illogical seller get out. Well, then what would happen is I would see that. I did that. So I would go and talk about price couldn't come to an agreement on the price and I'd leave. And then I'd see that property actually come on the market at a right price. And I questioned myself. I said, right. How come I didn't pray? And then I realized I wasn't giving them any reason to listen to me, to believe in me, to switch. So now I give my powerful listing presentation always before I talk about the price. I want to establish the credibility, DJ. I want them to go. My goal on every listing interview is to not to have them want to hire me, but to have them need to hire me to accomplish their goals or at least believe they need me. They need a guy like me to maximize the exposure and to get their own soul for their money. Once I could get that and I could see it in their eyes, I could hear it in their voice, I got them. This is mine. Then they're going to listen to me better and respect my my valuation of the price of their own. They're going to respect my opinion once they trust me and the way to earn that trust is by delivering a great presentation. And you've done your point. How we doing? How we doing? Man, we doing amazing. Doing amazing, by the way, because my mind is just being flooded because there's so many REALTORS that will show up to a listing presentation. And maybe they don't feel that there's a lot of competition. Maybe there isn't competition in this particular listing presentation. So they'll say things like, well, okay, what price point do you want, Mr. Mr. Mrs. Celler? Okay, well, we want to sell it at X. Okay, well, we can try to X and let's see what happens. You don't go you know the price point you want. And you're not really worried about the price because what because you are the expert, you need to first defend and impress upon them what all of the accrued all of the sort of reasons why they should trust you. The price is going to work itself out once they trust you because your whole mission is so that's really, really smart. As price is at the very, very end, I love that. I think that it's brilliant. It's the truth. In fact, if I, if I'm not even have to compete with another REALTOR, so if a seller says, Hey, Jordan, I'm not even interviewing anybody else. You're the number one guy in the county, obviously the top guy in our area. You're a good referral. All our friends have said you're great. All this kind of stuff. You don't even have to interview. We just want to come and basically come list me, right? I got to tell you, DJ, I still do my presentation. It's a 30 minute investment for me to be able to have them respect what we do as REALTORS. We work our asses off, right? I want to invest money. Notice I didn't say spend money, invest money. We invest time, money, passion, and energy to properly expose a home and get all them sold. So I want them to know that because I know I'm going to have more control of the escrow. I'm going to have more control on the inspection process, and I'm more control on the pricing. So I still want them to go, wow, I didn't realize you were going to do this that and the other to work, you know, to benefit me and the ability to sell my home. So thank you. So I give my presentation always, even if I don't have to, I give it. I know a lot of REALTORS are hearing this going, why would you do that? Why would you spend 30 minutes? I just explained why because it helps you on their respect even more. And it's professional. And we're in a professional environment. And even if it's your best friend who's going to be your client, treat him like a white glove. Look, if I walk into, let's just say like the Waldorf Astoria, which I once in a blue moon, I get to go to a place like that. It's a different experience than walking into a lower priced hotel, right? There, there is an experiential component to this that you that that top places have. Jordan has that and he applies it to all of his clients. And that is absolutely brilliant because of course, going back to our earlier point, everybody wants to feel special and important. Actually treat them as if they are because, no, guess what they are. They actually are important. You know, I love the fact that you just said the word professional. I asked myself that I could ask my assistants every day. So is this professional? Is this look professional? I don't put my picture on anything. Do you have to put my picture on ads? I don't put my picture on on my signs. I don't put my picture on anything because I always say to myself, when the day comes, that lawyers start doing that or doctors start putting their picture on their cards and things like that. I get some do. Then I want to do that. I want to make, I want to build my brand as professional classes like you. So that's amazing. So I tried to be as professional as I can clean lines, everything clean and versus like a, you know, you're never going to see a picture of me holding my dog in real estate advertising or pretending like I'm on the phone. You know, nothing that just kind of looks, you know, to me, doesn't look as professional. It's just a classy one. So that's it. And everyone knows by now how inauthentic it is. When you drive, you know, down, you know, in your case, you know, you drive in on PCH or whatever, and there's a billboard with a, you know, with a lawyer with his sleeve rolled up going, I'm going to fight for you when he's showing you his bicep and you're like, yeah, okay, we get it. We understand. I want to see you in the suit, though, when you get into the courtroom. But, uh, let's talk about, you know, we were so quick to shoe old ideas for how to, you know, old sales ideas, old marketing ideas. And I love the fact that you have actually taken some old techniques and actually made them not new again, but made them important again. And the fun, we're talking about fundamentals. So I'd love to hear how you've taken some older ideas and made them into sort of cutting edge strategies. Oh, 100% of DJI. I, that's exactly what I do, man. I take time tested, stuff that is work for, you know, decades and decades and decades. I just explain it better. And I like to think that I use it better and I elevate it. So for example, that's a great question, just list it, right? So every REALTOR will do a just listed, right? It helps build your geographical farm and all that kind of stuff. But how do you explain those on a listing presentation? So I'll tell you what I do. So first of all, I elevate it. So the way I got established in my farm and I continue to stay ahead of the curve in my marketing area, even like competing against great REALTORS, I say, ahead, I do it bigger and better. I do different shapes, different sizes, better quality card stop. But then it's the way I explain it on a listing presentation. So I'll say to a specialist, Mr. Seller. So the job of REALTORS to maximize the exposure, we need to cast a wide net. So in order to cast a wide net, I'm going to blow it up with print, I'm going to blow it up with social medium and blow it up with email class and all the other good stuff that I do to blow it up internationally and nationally. However, sometimes the buyer's going to come from drug, just drop in the line in the water. And the way I'm going to do that is these epic elevated just listed brochures. Notice I don't say postcards because it's not just a cheap postcard that someone's going to throw away. I like to invest in elevating it. So hopefully a buyer that isn't online all day every day searching Seller for a home actually lives in your area or one of my other that's also on my my mail list that isn't on the on the computer all day every day, you know, just swiping through Zillow, but they've always said, you know, if the right house, if that single story home with the pool and the view, which is what you have, Mr. Seller, comes across my desk or in my mailbox, I'm open to making that move. So what I want to do is I want to mail these incredible brochures to pass clients, sports agents, business managers, relocation companies and all your neighbors so they can open it up, knock throw it away so quick and say, man, honey, we love this neighborhood or our friends want to move in this neighborhood, isn't this the exact house that we would want to buy. So some but they're not again, they're not on Zillow all day every day. Open up the mail and they see something beautiful like this and I could show it to a seller. I can hand it to them. It's something that C field touch and appreciate. Don't you think there's a small chance, any chance that there's a buyer that lives right around the corner from you that'd be interested in your single story pool with a view home and they say, yeah, and I say so it's my job. The job of a REALTOR is to bring your home to them, not just hope that they find your home. So that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to bring your home to people. So that's an old trick, the old listing just listed, but if you do them right and you elevate it and you explain them in a listing interview, you're going to win. You're going to sound like an expert. What I say makes sense. There's some side benefits to it, building your geographical farm, just representing the homes well, representing yourself well, representing your industry and your business classy. But in reality, I sell homes every year as a direct result of those alone. Oh my gosh. You just said, so much there. I'm so impressed. I think there's a lot of our listeners that, you know, look, guys, this isn't a criticism of anyone listening. I'm certainly a good fall prey to this as well. But let's remember when we get a listing, it's not enough just to drop it onto the MLS and let it syndicate out all over online and hope that someone stumbles across it. What Jordan is talking about is going, oh yeah, yeah, no, I'm going to do that. But that's just like maybe the maybe step one. And then I've got 25 other steps that I'm going to do to continue to cast a net and shoot this out to neighbors. I know which neighborhoods feed into this neighborhood. I know where the people who want to live here now where they're currently living. I am going to send them a postcard to tell them about this postcard. I'm sorry. I'm really sure. I'm really sure. Yeah, it's an investment not not a giant, you know, even though some might do that. But it's a it's something that's not so easy to throw away. But what you do is you're pulling your name as well as trying to sell the home. But even more than that, it's a hell of a listing tool. If you use them, it's amazing. And you say what I say, you will win listings just that way alone. That's just one of my tools. The guys, the book is the agent's edge secret strategies to win listings and make your fortune selling real estate available everywhere. Books are sold. We'll have a link to it in the show notes. Jordan, you are absolutely right. But this idea of when you get a listing, everyone listening, you have to go out and find the buyers and you have to tell the seller how you were going to do that. And Jordan is the king of doing that. He just basically is the king, the king of that. And really think think about how powerful that is. Most REALTORS don't really do that. They'll say, well, we'll put it online and it'll get distributed in every realtoral, see it and they'll tell their clients what Jordan does is he goes, I know exactly where people who move who want to live in this. I know where they live now. And I'm going to make sure that they know that this place is available for sale. He did his homework. He knows his market. He is the king of his market because he knows where people want to live. And he goes out and says, hey, the reason why he wins listings and he's the number one remex guy in the world is he has a solution to all of the issues that may come up during the listing. He's like, don't worry, I know where the people that are going to buy this place probably live right now. I'm going to go over to them and make sure they know about it. Brilliant. That is a brilliant strategy for any homeowner. That's all a homeowner wants to hear is where are you going to find the buyer? And most listing agents go, well, we'll put it up. We'll see what happens. Yeah. Thank you, man. These are from the bottom of my heart. Thank you for sending all those great stuff, man. It's truly, truly appreciated. In fact, I'm kind of the anti-internet. So what I say is I say, Mr. Sellers, of course you're going to be on Zillow. Of course you're going to be on Realizer.com in Julia. Those are automatic polls. There's no question about it. In fact, I buy the upgraded packages because, yeah, the internet is a great way to market seller home. But we only have 30 to 45 to an hour here for me to convince you that I am the best. And the way I'm going to do that is tell you everything I do above and beyond the internet and above and beyond and better than the internet. But please know, of course you're going to be on Zillow with me as you would be with any other Realizer. I just want you to appreciate even more that I'm going to do to try to land that fire. And then I go through my series of marketing tools. And just listen, just one of them. Of course, I got many more that I talk about in the book for sure. It's incredible. It's really treating this. I get very excited talking to you because you take this very seriously. You have a, you are prepared. This, you don't wing, this is a performance. It is important. Right. When you're very scientific, yeah, of course, of course it is. And, and it is so impressive. I love hearing. And, and, you know, it's so funny because this is, this is how we distinguish people who are, you know, professionals from non professionals in this industry. And, and people who are successful tend to be very methodical. And it is, it is mostly about, you know, thinking three to four steps ahead, like, you know, this idea of coming, you already know the price point. I'm sure that you think is best. You're going to take that at the very, very end after you've already built so much rapport. And so much, you've even pressed upon them so much of your knowledge that they are now bought into you. It's that they're buying into your philosophy. And from there, then you can kind of steer the ship. Is it, do I have that right? Yeah, totally, totally get it. Yeah, absolutely. It's very methodical. That was a great word that you said. And, and for sure. And again, this is just like one part of the book, right? It's the listing presentation. I dive into how to turn open houses into listing opportunities, not just to pick up buyers, how to get listing interviews from I, I, I, I'm very, I talk a lot about pricing at a properly priced with language to use to try to control that aspect of not controls nothing necessarily the word, but to earn the respect when it comes to pricing. I like to think I, and I'd protect your commission. That's something I'm very proud of is how I present my full commission. I'm proud to say that I am a full commission agent. I earn that. And it's what I say that how, how would I go about that? I love it. What, what prompted you to want to write a book and, and give this out to this information out to other agents? To great question, man. I, I was selling a home to an agent from CAA, so creative artist, because of the big, big moving agent. And I sold him a home in my area, that I work called North Ranch Area of West Lake Village. And I sold him a home there. And then I listed his home, Holly with Hills. And he goes, Hey, man, you're so good at this. You ought to write a book. You ever thought about that? And I go, thank you. I go, I actually have. I thought about writing. I've been doing this for 33 years, DJ. I'm at the point of my career where I actually like, you know, help another REALTOR's. It's not a, it's not a corny thing. It's just, I dig it. Like, I, I replied every DM and email and call it. If I could help somebody make more money, it's, it's a good thing. And I feel good about that. So I actually said, I've been thinking about that. He goes, can I connect you with one of our literary agents? Oh, man, you kidding me. Of course. So I did a zoom with the literary agent, a man that he was, hey, and then he asked if he, he loved, we got along beautifully. He said, man, I love this idea. This book. It's a business book. How to sell real estate? Remember, DJ, this isn't a motivation book. I don't tell anybody to drink juice, exercise, or a vision board. It's not an energy book. None of that kind of stuff. This is a how to sell real estate book for real estate agents. So he said, so he said, we love to represent you. That was a win beyond DJ. I couldn't wait to tell my wife that I, I, I, I, go, wait a minute. You tell me I have been agent because you, man, I'm, I'm a REALTOR. I've never been on that side of the table. You work with agents. Yeah, man. I've never been on that side of the table. So he said, absolutely. So I got excited. And then you write a treatment, but what the book would look like. So I did that. And that took me a long time because I wanted to be really good. And then the agent took that and he put it out to all the publishers. I had multiple offers. And I signed with Harper Collins leadership because I just loved, you know, Tim, and Sicily, who are the Harper Collins team, the leadership team. And we took it from there. Then I had a great collaborator to help me put this in paper named Mark Tab. And we wrote a phenomenal book that I'm very proud of. And the review, by the way, today is a very special day. DJ today is launch day. So all the people that have been preordering it. And there's thousands of them over the past few months to receive their books today. So I'm already getting some amazing reviews. And it's a very, very problem moment for me. It's June 6th. And I'm very grateful and humbled by all the great reviews. So that's how the book came about. And I wrote it and I'm proud of it. Well, the book is called agents edge, seek its strategies to win listings and make your fortune selling real estate. And it is available literally everywhere that books are sold Amazon. Of course, Barnes and Noble target online. Of course, everywhere Walmart is too. So please, everyone go out and get their book. We'll have a link to the Amazon store for the book right in our show notes. One last question, Jordan, for you. Just out of curiosity. What's the most satisfying part of being a REALTOR for you? Obviously you do this. You've worked on the smallest of starter homes to polatial states. What is it that what do you enjoy the most about being a REALTOR? I DJ, you want the truth or you want the corny bullshit answer? I want the truth. The best part is going to the bank after it closes, man. If you've done, they put that money in the bank. That's the best part, man. Listen, I've been doing this a long time. I just want to save as much money as I can so someday I can slow myself down. I love moving people. I love having happy buyers and happy sellers and watching people accomplish their goals. I love it. But for me personally, the best part is when the deal closes and I get paid. And I think I hope a lot of REALTOR that are listening to this go, man, I'm glad he said that because I think we're all in agreement. It's very easy for a REALTOR to say, oh, I don't care at all about that. I just want to make people happy. Well, that's fine and dandy. But at the end of the day, we got a job to do, man. And I want to do as well as I can. So that's that's my happy moment is when it closes and I get a congratulate people and get that check. That's the happiest moment for me. That's the truth. That's the truth. I'm losing you. I'm losing you. You're cutting out a little bit. Say that one more time. Sorry, guys. Yeah, I, I, I love that. Jordan, thank you. I know we're having some tactical difficulties. We'll get that worked out. Sorry about so sorry about that. But absolutely a group. Ah, dang. I can't hear you at all. You've closed. Let's see, Jordan, if I can get better hang on one sec. Sorry. Sorry about that. Oh, that's okay. I'm an incleror now. Now I got you. It's a little bit better now. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Okay. Sorry. I don't know what's going on here. That was awesome. And I love that. And I appreciate that. And of course, that's the best part is going, you know, getting paid and going to the bank. And it's, it's something that, you know, we shouldn't pretend it's not the, like a lot of times people will say, uh, everything but that, right? They'll say, oh, it's about helping people. And of course it is that too. But we don't, we don't tend to celebrate the financial part of it. And why are we in this business if we don't want to celebrate the financial part? Yeah, yeah. I mean, I really love when, when people close and close in a big one today. And I'm excited about that. Close and big one today at the name drop. I don't mind name drop it for Brett Michaels, you know, from poison man. Of course, sure. I love, I get, I get a representative on a ton of deals. I love them every deal and with that guy. It's all about good karma, right? So I'm closing a good karma deal today. And it's a very exciting for me. So man, I love to see him happy. I love to see the fire of his home happy. I love everybody to be happy. But I'm going to be the happiest when I go to the bank at the end of the day and make my deposit. You can rock a red bandana to closing. As Brett is known to do. That's amazing, amazing. Jordan Cohen is new book is called the Agents Edge Secret Strategies to Win Listings and making your fortune selling real estate.
