[00:04:14] DJ, thanks for having me and hello from New York.
[00:04:19] Hello from Chicago and hello to all of our listeners from all over.
[00:04:25] Scott really excited to chat with you.
[00:04:27] I love when I get to talk to somebody who has approaching the billion dollar mark or
[00:04:33] I think you guys have exceeded that.
[00:04:35] You're having an amazing year.
[00:04:36] We were talking offline and Scott, his team is having their best year ever.
[00:04:41] This is 2023.
[00:04:42] I want to just make sure if somebody's listening to this at a different time.
[00:04:46] This is a tough year for most agents, but Scott and his team are crushing it.
[00:04:50] So we're excited to find out maybe what they're doing and what our listeners can learn
[00:04:54] from Scott.
[00:04:55] I'd love to really start at the beginning of your journey into real estate.
[00:04:59] So what brought you to real estate?
[00:05:01] Well, I grew up in New Orleans and my family, my father had warehouses.
[00:05:08] He still runs a wholesale hardware business.
[00:05:13] So I spent a lot of sick days or summer vacation days in his warehouse running around doing
[00:05:20] stuff.
[00:05:20] My best friend and I were riding bikes in the warbs on the Mississippi River down by the
[00:05:26] French Quarter.
[00:05:26] If you've ever been down there.
[00:05:28] Sure.
[00:05:28] And my mom ended up in high school being the marketing director for a Merrill Lynch affiliate.
[00:05:34] So there's like a lot of commercial and residential real estate in my background.
[00:05:37] And for me, it was all about the architecture and design.
[00:05:40] I loved all the old Spanish and French architecture of the French Quarter.
[00:05:45] My very best friend was there and I was sort of steeped in it and then did nothing with
[00:05:50] real estate for years.
[00:05:52] I was touring musician for the better part of my 20s doing sales on one side, booking
[00:05:57] bands and then on the other side, being on the road.
[00:06:02] And when I finally decided I needed to make a move.
[00:06:05] I was in Boston at the time.
[00:06:07] I moved to New York and my stepmother.
[00:06:10] And as you may have people in your lives who know you better than you know yourself, they're
[00:06:14] like, Scott, I think you would be a great real estate agent.
[00:06:18] And it's not something that I ever thought about.
[00:06:21] I actually found my college application recently and it said, I think I want to get into
[00:06:27] something to do with architecture.
[00:06:30] And I was like, huh, that's pretty funny.
[00:06:32] So I ended up here and sure enough that that first year real estate, when I moved to New
[00:06:37] York, I had no job, no place to live, no girlfriend, nothing.
[00:06:42] And just kind of contacts and a real passion wanting to be successful.
[00:06:47] And it was like a duck to water.
[00:06:49] Real estate was just, I got my license.
[00:06:51] It started doing rentals, which is something you can really dive into in New York because
[00:06:56] it's so much of the business, so much of what people live in here.
[00:06:59] And it's just been brick by brick building the business over 20 years.
[00:07:04] It's amazing.
[00:07:06] As a musician, so tell us about a musician, what instruments did you play?
[00:07:13] So if you know like pentatonics, you know, some of those aqua, sure.
[00:07:19] 
[00:07:19] It was like a boy band for aqua, in the late 90s, we used to open for bands like NSYNC and
[00:07:28] 98 degrees and amazing, crazy and ridiculous.
[00:07:32] And we were, you know, wearing all of, you know, you can just imagine what we were wearing.
[00:07:36] And all of that, it was a lot of fun.
[00:07:38] I think I had blue hair for a while.
[00:07:40] It was hilarious.
[00:07:41] And so I was a singer.
[00:07:43] That was amazing.
[00:07:44] And singer and dancer I'm guessing probably a lot of.
[00:07:47] I can move a little bit.
[00:07:48] I would say the dancing is like, I don't know how much of the threat I'm going to be on
[00:07:52] anybody's dance floor.
[00:07:53] But definitely had a lot of time, a lot of fun jumping around.
[00:07:57] That's for sure.
[00:07:58] A lot of energy.
[00:07:59] That's amazing.
[00:08:00] I love that.
[00:08:02] So really, I want to sort of dive in.
[00:08:04] You know, maybe people just dive into, you know, the success you guys have been having this year
[00:08:09] because I'm always impressed with success.
[00:08:12] And, you know, I think our, the whole purpose of our podcast is to talk about people who are
[00:08:16] successful anyway.
[00:08:18] That, of course, you are having a great year.
[00:08:20] You and your team.
[00:08:21] By the way, I want to mention real quickly before we get started, I usually save this to
[00:08:24] the end and then I forget to do it often.
[00:08:26] But if you are an agent in the New York City area, if you're working Manhattan, maybe Brooklyn,
[00:08:32] you know, really anywhere in New York and you are interested in maybe looking to see
[00:08:37] what other teams have to, what they have to offer.
[00:08:39] Maybe you're not getting the right attention or training or support from your existing
[00:08:43] firm.
[00:08:44] Brown hair, Stevens, of course, is a absolutely super reputable firm.
[00:08:48] One of the big, big firms in the country, but Scott Harris and his team would love the
[00:08:53] opportunity to chat with you.
[00:08:54] So just keep that in mind as we're talking because Scott, this team is doing really well
[00:08:59] this year and they're expanding.
[00:09:01] So keep it in mind.
[00:09:02] But, but, Scott, yeah, let's talk about what, how, how are you guys having such a great
[00:09:07] year?
[00:09:07] What do you think you're doing that is, that is paying off right now?
[00:09:12] Well, first I think it's in terms of how we think about the business big picture.
[00:09:19] It's all about helping.
[00:09:21] It's all about service to our clients.
[00:09:23] So in a moment where you may not be doing as many transactions, I never think about,
[00:09:30] you're saying, oh, they're doing great this year.
[00:09:32] All of that is just the last, the only thing you can see at the end.
[00:09:37] It's the lag, they call it like lag measures, right?
[00:09:40] It's exactly right, right?
[00:09:41] Lead measures are how are we adding value to clients?
[00:09:45] And so if you're every person listening, you have something special about you.
[00:09:52] You have some, you come from, you know, whether you're, whatever you did before, I found
[00:09:57] like school teachers who become real estate agents are the most amazing.
[00:10:00] They're so patient and they can really create good boundaries and like be good listeners.
[00:10:05] So that's just one example, actors, singers, performers, that's one side of it.
[00:10:11] They're great salespeople, but who are, you know, therapists?
[00:10:15] We're like therapists and real estate is just the vehicle, right?
[00:10:19] It's a, it's a people business.
[00:10:21] And so what we've been doing for 20 years is developing relationships across every imaginable industry.
[00:10:29] And so when I sit down with my client, I'm just listening.
[00:10:32] What are the things they need?
[00:10:34] How can I help them across the board?
[00:10:36] And I just found that the more value you add for your client, I want to introduce you to this person.
[00:10:42] I want to introduce you to this person with absolutely no expectations of what it's going to turn into.
[00:10:47] Has I know that that is the, that's the foundation for our success.
[00:10:52] And it just keeps, it's like an evergreen thing, you know, you start January 1st.
[00:10:56] Oh, I have, I have to do this whole thing again.
[00:10:58] But what you've already done is just connect to your clients and be that person that they call for everything.
[00:11:06] Yeah.
[00:11:07] And how does that relate to like a very specific, you know, we're helping someone sell an apartment, helping someone buy.
[00:11:13] We really take an A to Z approach.
[00:11:14] It's like any buyer setting the table above and beyond.
[00:11:19] I mean, anything you need, you can be based in Asia or in the Middle East or Europe or wherever you are.
[00:11:26] We can take care of every single thing to do with the preparation of your home.
[00:11:31] Above and beyond in terms of communication, our team is 11, but our extended team is 50, 100, 200 trusted people that we can go to and make sure that we get things done.
[00:11:45] 
[00:11:46] So it's, it's a combination of the actual deal making where we really are focused on taking care of everything.
[00:11:54] And that just establishes this huge amount of trust.
[00:11:57] But I think it's also big picture.
[00:11:59] How can we serve our clients?
[00:12:02] Even when they're not clients, everybody, everybody, it's not about, hey, do you ever referral for me?
[00:12:07] Because you hear that thing all the time.
[00:12:08] That's the best compliment you can give.
[00:12:10] Blah, blah, blah.
[00:12:11] Because that's what I mean.
[00:12:12] And it's great advice for anybody who's ever read the million dollar real estate agent.
[00:12:17] That is a great source of language.
[00:12:20] Like to think about how you can, you know, how you can cultivate referrals.
[00:12:25] But it's much easier than that.
[00:12:27] Just get into conversation with lots of people and ultimately you're going to help them in some way.
[00:12:31] And then they're going to, they're never going to forget you.
[00:12:34] Maybe that's generic.
[00:12:35] I mean, I can get, I can get more detailed about how it's helped this year.
[00:12:38] I always think the fundamentals win the game.
[00:12:41] So what you're talking about is really consistent with almost everyone I've ever had on the show
[00:12:48] who are all top 1% producers in the country.
[00:12:51] So is it unique?
[00:12:54] No, but success usually isn't unique.
[00:12:56] It's usually the action that is taken, you know, consistently.
[00:13:01] And obviously you guys are doing that.
[00:13:03] And I do want to dive into it a little deeper because I'm curious.
[00:13:07] You mentioned, you know, providing value even when someone's not a client.
[00:13:11] So this, this is for our listeners, this could be, you know, before they're ready to use
[00:13:16] you.
[00:13:16] They've never used you before, but you want to start building that trust and building
[00:13:20] that, that relationship or they have already used you.
[00:13:23] And they're, you know, in between transactions.
[00:13:26] And that may be seven, 10 years, whatever it is in your local market.
[00:13:29] And I suspect Scott, you guys have an approach to handle both of those scenarios when you
[00:13:35] meet somebody first and then after a transaction, you know, sort of how you stay in touch.
[00:13:40] So I'd love to hear more about how you guys continue to add value.
[00:13:44] Well, I would say it's like chicken or the egg, right?
[00:13:48] If you're starting, if you're new in the business, what can you do?
[00:13:52] You want to make a list.
[00:13:54] Who are the 50 people in your life that are your biggest fans, right?
[00:13:58] And start just being consistent.
[00:14:00] It doesn't have to be 50 calls a day, but can it be five?
[00:14:04] Can it be five reaches out reaches to every single day?
[00:14:08] It's the consistency.
[00:14:09] It's just like going to the gym.
[00:14:10] It's like any kind of consistency you can build in your calendar just to reach out.
[00:14:15] I mean, yesterday, right?
[00:14:17] And it can be very intuitive.
[00:14:18] You have this list in front of you.
[00:14:19] It can be very old school looking at the list.
[00:14:22] Who are the five people that pop out of that list when you look at it?
[00:14:25] I reached out to five people yesterday.
[00:14:27] One person told me his, somebody in his family passed away and they're going to hire me
[00:14:31] to sell their place in, you know, in the spring.
[00:14:34] I haven't talked to him in probably a year.
[00:14:37] And I just, hey, how are you?
[00:14:38] I was in your building.
[00:14:39] Oh, well, building.
[00:14:40] I was thinking about you.
[00:14:41] And that was just my connection point.
[00:14:44] Somebody else I hadn't spoken to in a year.
[00:14:45] He popped out of the list.
[00:14:46] I said, let me reach out to so and so.
[00:14:48] And he said, oh, I'm looking to buy and flip something in the city.
[00:14:52] We ran, we're finished our projects in Connecticut.
[00:14:54] We're ready to come back in the city.
[00:14:55] There are opportunities.
[00:14:56] And that's just yesterday.
[00:14:58] So you have your top 50 people.
[00:15:00] You reach out to them and just listen.
[00:15:03] I think the most important thing you can do is, is just the agenda is, I want to
[00:15:09] connect with this person.
[00:15:11] I care about this person.
[00:15:13] They care about me.
[00:15:14] It's so much more fundamentally about the people.
[00:15:18] And if you really just focus on that, something good comes out of it.
[00:15:22] You're going to find a way to be of service to them.
[00:15:25] I mean, my fundamental, for those of you who might be in like a networking group, like
[00:15:29] a BNI or any kind of networking group across the country, they're amazing.
[00:15:33] It's all about giving with no expectation.
[00:15:37] And then knowing that it's going to come back from everywhere.
[00:15:40] And that's, that has been, that's just how I am.
[00:15:43] I want to help people out.
[00:15:44] I want to listen for ways to help them.
[00:15:46] But it's just doing that on a consistent basis, will ultimately get the ball rolling.
[00:15:51] Yeah, I agree.
[00:15:52] And I think it's kind of the most fun part of the job for a lot of agents, which is, I
[00:15:58] get to help people first.
[00:16:00] And I'm doing that for free.
[00:16:01] And it might look different to each particular contact or client.
[00:16:06] Maybe I'm connecting somebody with somebody who does roofing or I'm connecting somebody
[00:16:10] with a dentist or helping somebody start to think about where their next home might be
[00:16:16] because of schooling and they have children.
[00:16:19] Or whatever, just it could be anything.
[00:16:22] But maybe the transaction isn't today.
[00:16:24] But providing that kind of guidance and assistance is really what every person in this world
[00:16:30] wants.
[00:16:31] We want people to come with ideas to us and people to listen to our challenges.
[00:16:35] And there aren't many professions other than therapists, maybe attorneys, doctors, I
[00:16:41] guess, who really get to know their clients.
[00:16:45] And I think real estate is one of those professions where you really get a deep dive into somebody
[00:16:50] and that allows you to build more intimate relationships with people.
[00:16:54] But like Scott was saying, you really have to go first and you have to pick up the phone.
[00:16:58] And I love the fact that we have social media now to help us give us those contact points
[00:17:05] like Scott was saying, he's just calling, hey, how's it going?
[00:17:08] I was in your building.
[00:17:09] LinkedIn is a great place to find out what's going on with someone's professional life.
[00:17:14] You can see if there's any news about their company.
[00:17:16] You can see if they've had a promotion.
[00:17:17] You can even see when their birthday is that kind of thing.
[00:17:20] And you can just pick up the phone and say, hey, I was on LinkedIn.
[00:17:22] I saw you just got a promotion.
[00:17:23] Like that's a contact point, right?
[00:17:25] So there's so much opportunity to pick up the phone and call and talk with people.
[00:17:30] And I want to talk, Scott, I want to pivot a little bit to talking about believing in your clients.
[00:17:35] I know that's a big thing for you.
[00:17:37] So sort of walk us through, what does that mean to you and how do you create this sort of safe place
[00:17:44] for them to be able to share their lives with you?
[00:17:47] So I want to give a shout out.
[00:17:49] I listen to a lot of a guy named Ed Mylett who has this wonderful podcast.
[00:17:54] He's just terrific.
[00:17:56] And I'm not cribbing from him, but he said something recently,
[00:18:00] which I think is just it's how we run our business.
[00:18:04] It's I see the potential in people and more than that.
[00:18:09] When I sit down with someone and we get on the phone or even have a Zoom, right?
[00:18:15] That I'm listening to what their dreams are.
[00:18:19] I'm like a, I can eat your old kid listening to his parents.
[00:18:22] If the parent says, hey, I'm writing a book or hey, I'm starting a business.
[00:18:27] Hey, I'm opening a restaurant.
[00:18:28] Little Johnny doesn't say, well, what if the, you know, what if I, he can't raise the money
[00:18:33] and what if I can't work out a deal with the landlord and, you know, what if,
[00:18:37] I don't know what I'm doing.
[00:18:39] Little Johnny just believes that his parents are, you know, his dad or mom is starting this business
[00:18:44] and they're, they just, it's going to happen.
[00:18:46] It is already real, right?
[00:18:48] So what I don't know how I've maintained this sort of innocent belief in people,
[00:18:55] but it is that simple.
[00:18:58] Someone says, I want to do this.
[00:18:59] I'm like, it's happening.
[00:19:00] I, we are going to make it happen.
[00:19:02] I don't know how and I'm not worried about how.
[00:19:05] I have 20 years of experience.
[00:19:06] We will figure out how along the way, but it's going to happen because you,
[00:19:12] we've created a space where I really hear what it is you want.
[00:19:16] And they're things you might say, they're things you might not say.
[00:19:19] I'm listening for both.
[00:19:21] And we're starting to create this vision for what buyers are looking for or sellers,
[00:19:27] what's next for them.
[00:19:28] And it's sort of, you know, I have four pillars of what I call visionary brokerage.
[00:19:32] The first one is understanding, like, who are you?
[00:19:35] It's not about your properties.
[00:19:36] It's just who are you?
[00:19:37] What made you fall in love with where you live?
[00:19:39] What are you looking to do?
[00:19:42] And it's this fundamental belief in people that they can, that we can help them do it
[00:19:48] is like the most important.
[00:19:50] And then we add wisdom on top.
[00:19:52] That's our second pillar.
[00:19:53] And then we can have all these insights.
[00:19:55] You know, the way we run the business is create this system.
[00:19:59] You know, all of the, I have an amazing operations person out, give a shout out to Karen,
[00:20:03] who does, she's incredible and a transaction coordinator who's broke and she's incredible.
[00:20:08] So we have the system, the structure in place.
[00:20:10] But it allows for all this intuition where we can just have this crazy idea of like,
[00:20:16] hey, maybe we should, you want to look on the West side of Manhattan.
[00:20:19] We have this idea, what about this thing over here?
[00:20:21] And we just have to trust honor that, like, that intuition that sort of comes out of nowhere
[00:20:28] because we've created the space where it happens.
[00:20:31] And I can pause there, but it's, some people say it sounds a little woo-woo, you know,
[00:20:37] a little, you know, but I really think it's about having the structure in place so that magic happens.
[00:20:44] Really?
[00:20:45] You are, you are so 100% right.
[00:20:47] And it's not, it's not woo-woo, it's, it's just harder to measure, right?
[00:20:52] So intuition is hard to sort of understand, but we all have had experiences.
[00:20:57] And it's been my experience throughout life that my intuition is usually right.
[00:21:04] I won't say it's 100% right, but it's usually right.
[00:21:07] Maybe 80%, maybe not, maybe it's higher than that.
[00:21:10] And if that's true, then I have a really valuable resource inside of me.
[00:21:14] However, I have to get quiet enough to, or create a container where that intuition is free to,
[00:21:23] to spring forth, right?
[00:21:25] And so Scott is talking about doing this themselves because he's right.
[00:21:28] There are times where, you know, gosh, there's nothing on the East side,
[00:21:32] but we have this other thing over there.
[00:21:33] And it sort of feels like it might be a fit for them.
[00:21:36] And even though it's not really what they're looking for, it feels like it might be.
[00:21:40] So, you know, those are kind of ideas that spring forth.
[00:21:43] It reminds me of that old saying as a musician, you'll appreciate this.
[00:21:47] It's not the notes that make the music.
[00:21:49] It's the space between the notes.
[00:21:51] It's actually the silence between the notes that creates sound.
[00:21:54] Otherwise, it would just be one blaring sound.
[00:21:56] So what we're doing is what Scott's really talking about is creating an environment
[00:22:01] where intuition can thrive.
[00:22:04] And that is, yes, maybe it sounds a little new agey,
[00:22:08] but it boy, it's powerful.
[00:22:09] And just about every REALTOR I've talked to talks about their intuition.
[00:22:13] They trust their gut.
[00:22:14] Well, I think the part that people forget is it's your job to create, like, I think of us as like,
[00:22:23] we're the captains of the ship, right?
[00:22:25] We're steering it.
[00:22:26] And they're all, you just forget.
[00:22:30] Unless you put yourself through it every now and then just how stressful this is,
[00:22:35] right?
[00:22:37] Think about people, the most stressful things in people's lives are losing a loved one,
[00:22:41] getting divorced and moving, right?
[00:22:45] Maybe, you know, the new job, losing your job.
[00:22:48] But like, we encounter people at their most stressed.
[00:22:52] Yes.
[00:22:53] Job one is to like really be calm and be the space when they come in contact with you.
[00:22:58] Everything swirling around, you're like in the middle and like, it's all good, right?
[00:23:03] It's like, you have to, however you get there, yoga,
[00:23:08] zumba, meditation, whatever it takes, go running.
[00:23:11] I don't, you know, I do a few of those different things,
[00:23:14] but whatever gets you so that when people come in contact with you, they're like, okay,
[00:23:18] this person knows what they're doing.
[00:23:21] And I trust them because when things are crazy, they just settle in.
[00:23:24] Like, oh, wait, we can find a solution here.
[00:23:27] And yeah, the idea of this healthy power, you don't get sucked into the drama.
[00:23:33] And so many agents do.
[00:23:35] And of course, I mean, have I ever, have I yelled probably this week at somebody, right?
[00:23:40] Maybe not, but, you know, it's just so easy to lose your temper when the stress level's high.
[00:23:45] And you really want to close this deal.
[00:23:47] Oh my god, it's like everything is weighing on getting this one deal closed,
[00:23:51] especially in a harder market.
[00:23:52] But you have to be like, wait a minute.
[00:23:54] Like that, it's going to happen the way it's going to happen.
[00:23:57] It's going to, it's not this one.
[00:23:58] It'll be the next one.
[00:23:59] But it's like, how can I just stay calm?
[00:24:02] Right.
[00:24:03] You're so, so absolutely right.
[00:24:05] I really want to step on this point because as real estate professionals,
[00:24:08] we forget oftentimes what it's like for the consumer.
[00:24:11] And the consumer isn't always sharing how stressed they are because there is,
[00:24:17] it's a vulnerable thing sometimes to say to a real estate agent.
[00:24:21] Maybe you're working with for the very first time and you're going through a transaction.
[00:24:25] And, you know, the consumer is stressed about a particular bump in the road along the way.
[00:24:30] And, you know, maybe they're sharing it with their agent or maybe they're trying to just tough
[00:24:35] it out going, you know, but realistically, we know that, you know, real estate transactions
[00:24:42] are stressful.
[00:24:43] And it doesn't help if the real estate agent that you're employing is also feeling that same
[00:24:48] level of stress.
[00:24:50] So, right, the real estate agent is there to calm the situation, reduce the activation,
[00:24:56] help solve those problems.
[00:24:57] And so, you're so right.
[00:24:58] Is whatever you need to do to reduce your activation, staying out of the drama,
[00:25:03] you know, processing whatever, you know, negative stuff is flowing through you.
[00:25:08] And it flows through all of us.
[00:25:09] It happens like you were saying, you know, we all get angry, sad, scared.
[00:25:13] And learning how to manage those emotions more effectively.
[00:25:15] So, we can show up and be that for our clients who are going to need it the most.
[00:25:20] Can I give you an example of something that just happened?
[00:25:22] Please.
[00:25:22] So, yesterday, we've got a, I mean, it's the scale.
[00:25:26] I think it's like, if it gets overwhelming to you, if you're listening, it's like just
[00:25:30] remove a zero, right?
[00:25:31] This is like a three and a half million dollar deal.
[00:25:34] And the buyers say,
[00:25:36] I'm stressed already.
[00:25:37] Oh my god, you know, this is going to be such a big deal.
[00:25:39] It's like, okay.
[00:25:40] And the buyer came to us and we were asking all these concessions.
[00:25:43] It's a new building.
[00:25:43] And the buyer said, I want you to give us, we're already given a small concession on our
[00:25:48] commission to get to just finalize the deal.
[00:25:51] And they asked for, they were, it wasn't enough.
[00:25:54] They wanted us to give another few thousand dollars.
[00:25:56] And they were texting with a woman on my team.
[00:25:59] And she's texting me, we have to say something.
[00:26:00] We have to do something.
[00:26:01] And I said, you know what we need to do?
[00:26:03] Nothing.
[00:26:04] Like we are going to do nothing today.
[00:26:07] I'm not making this decision on the back foot when everything is swirling.
[00:26:11] Let it sleep on it, go exercise, go get a drink, whatever you need to do tonight.
[00:26:16] We're going to touch this tomorrow morning.
[00:26:17] And the buyer calmed down and his attorney reached out to us and said,
[00:26:21] look, we just need to do something.
[00:26:23] And this is, and it was very concrete.
[00:26:25] And we were like, that's fine, right?
[00:26:27] But it, it solved itself.
[00:26:29] And the bad, and sometimes you just have to not respond to that email.
[00:26:33] Doing what is today is doing something.
[00:26:37] Right?
[00:26:38] Yes.
[00:26:38] It's like, if you are like,
[00:26:40] oh my god, freaking out, just put the phone down, put it in another room.
[00:26:44] Go have dinner.
[00:26:45] I know it may not be the best, the most fun dinner.
[00:26:48] But like try to distract yourself with something positive.
[00:26:52] And I, that's we, we focus on it all the time.
[00:26:55] Because the solutions come to you.
[00:26:58] People say, I'll sleep on it and whatever.
[00:27:00] It's actually a thing.
[00:27:01] You wake up a little, with a little different perspective.
[00:27:05] Yes.
[00:27:06] And maybe you've processed some of that stress while you're sleeping
[00:27:09] or whatever activity.
[00:27:11] You know, it's so funny, Scott.
[00:27:12] I was, I just learned this in 47.
[00:27:14] I wish I would have learned this much, much earlier in life.
[00:27:18] But I was doing a meditation class.
[00:27:20] It was actually taught by LeBron James of all people.
[00:27:23] And so it was kind of funny.
[00:27:24] And I was like, okay, I know.
[00:27:26] I would love to know what LeBron James does is one of the greatest of all time.
[00:27:30] And he said it's critical for him to be mindful of his emotions.
[00:27:35] Because in really stressful times on the court,
[00:27:38] he can't allow himself to get angry or scared or sad.
[00:27:44] Because it impedes his ability to do his job.
[00:27:47] And he actually has less access to his,
[00:27:51] all his resources when he's stressed.
[00:27:53] And we know that the sympathetic nervous system,
[00:27:56] the fight or flight response kicks in when we're stressed.
[00:27:59] And you just, if you do just a cursory dive into what happens biologically,
[00:28:04] we are limited in our resources.
[00:28:06] Our brain has limited resources.
[00:28:09] Our body is literally trying to survive at that moment.
[00:28:12] So it's not the time to make any sort of really impactful decision,
[00:28:16] unless you're in a literally life or death situation.
[00:28:19] That's why those resources are there.
[00:28:22] So being that that's not probably what's happening.
[00:28:25] It's not the time to make decisions.
[00:28:27] And he talked about that in this meditation course.
[00:28:29] And he's like, I have to be calm on the court.
[00:28:32] Because if I get upset, I lose.
[00:28:34] He goes, I actually will perform worse.
[00:28:37] And this is the number one guy, maybe of all time,
[00:28:40] saying that are certainly one of them.
[00:28:42] So I am right on the same page with you.
[00:28:44] And there are ways to learn how to,
[00:28:47] you know, man better manage your emotions.
[00:28:49] Or like Scott says, you know, hey,
[00:28:50] even if it's just go take a walk, go have dinner, sleep on it,
[00:28:55] could not agree with you more.
[00:28:56] That is such a wise test.
[00:28:58] You know, I'm just thinking, you asked me,
[00:29:00] how are we being successful this year?
[00:29:02] And people accuse me of being an optimist.
[00:29:06] Okay, and I will gladly say like, yes,
[00:29:09] I'm an optimist.
[00:29:10] And I think to be a good agent, you have to believe in your clients.
[00:29:14] You have to believe in being successful for them.
[00:29:17] Right?
[00:29:17] But you also, there are so much noise.
[00:29:22] There's so much negativity in the news.
[00:29:24] And on social media in places, right?
[00:29:27] And I would encourage people to take a look at what they're consuming
[00:29:33] and reading and even the people they're around.
[00:29:37] You know, there are agents who are doing great.
[00:29:40] And even if they're having a tougher year,
[00:29:42] like be around the people that are positive,
[00:29:45] be around, surround yourself with some positivity,
[00:29:48] people who have ideas.
[00:29:50] How are they going to actually move forward?
[00:29:52] Don't the people who are complaining about what's going on?
[00:29:55] But they're like, hey, let me try something new to get this sold.
[00:29:59] Let me try this thing.
[00:30:00] This is a working, let me try this.
[00:30:01] Okay, it's not always, it could be just price.
[00:30:04] You know, but there's always something to do.
[00:30:06] But I think the bigger picture is maybe stop looking at the news.
[00:30:11] Right?
[00:30:11] Maybe of subtract some of the stuff that just leaves you
[00:30:14] prominently stressed out all the time.
[00:30:18] There are so many agents who said to me,
[00:30:20] yeah, you know, there's no inventory in my town.
[00:30:23] And we talk through it.
[00:30:25] You're like, okay, well, how do you, if ask a different question?
[00:30:29] Oh, right.
[00:30:30] How can I create some inventory?
[00:30:32] You know, ask it and then maybe you'll have an idea
[00:30:34] that just comes out of nowhere.
[00:30:36] Like maybe you want to host a dinner
[00:30:38] or maybe you want to have people over to your home.
[00:30:40] And just, you know, talk about the successes you're having.
[00:30:44] And something might unlock.
[00:30:45] Something might, you know, if you do,
[00:30:46] if that results in one more deal this year,
[00:30:48] wouldn't that be great?
[00:30:50] As opposed, you know, it's, you know, just sitting there.
[00:30:52] That is such a great, ask a different question.
[00:30:55] That is such great advice.
[00:30:57] So Scott just said, you know, you're,
[00:30:59] let's say you work with a buyer, there's no inventory.
[00:31:01] And it's frustrating.
[00:31:02] Of course, it's frustrating.
[00:31:03] It's frustrating for the buyer.
[00:31:04] It's frustrating for the agent.
[00:31:06] And Scott says, okay, well, let's ask a different question.
[00:31:08] We can't fix that.
[00:31:09] That is, you know, what is is that old Zen saying what,
[00:31:13] or people say, I don't know, they say the different ones.
[00:31:16] What is, it is what it is.
[00:31:18] Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:19] I learned in a different way.
[00:31:21] What is is what one is the same thing.
[00:31:23] But what is is?
[00:31:24] And if you push against reality,
[00:31:26] you're, you're just going to tire yourself out
[00:31:28] and you're not going to affect it.
[00:31:30] But if you pivot and ask a different question,
[00:31:32] how can I create inventory?
[00:31:35] Well, that solves a lot of problems, right?
[00:31:37] And ultimately, that's, that's the job of the agent
[00:31:40] is to create a problem solving.
[00:31:43] And I could not agree with you more.
[00:31:46] Change the questions.
[00:31:47] Change the, notice how you feel
[00:31:50] when you're watching an absorbing information,
[00:31:53] news, social media, whatever.
[00:31:55] If it makes you feel good, good.
[00:31:57] If it doesn't make you feel good, be mindful of that
[00:32:00] and limit, because that is,
[00:32:02] limit the amount of exposure you have to,
[00:32:04] is going to influence how you feel.
[00:32:06] It just does.
[00:32:07] It's just the way it works.
[00:32:09] And social media and news media in particular
[00:32:12] are very skilled at creating a motion,
[00:32:16] emotional intensity with their viewers, their audience.
[00:32:19] That's their job.
[00:32:20] That is how they get paid.
[00:32:22] So it's not that it's not important information to hear.
[00:32:26] It's just you have to realize that the way they keep you
[00:32:29] attuned to their channel or their website
[00:32:32] is by creating such an emotional intense environment
[00:32:35] that sort of captivates you.
[00:32:38] And you have to be careful
[00:32:39] because that's going to influence how you feel.
[00:32:43] Indeed.
[00:32:44] Yeah, so I was just, I was thinking about
[00:32:48] the one thing that we do,
[00:32:49] we have a stand up meeting
[00:32:52] three days a week as a team.
[00:32:55] And I mean, I meet with the members of the team
[00:32:57] every other week on one to one,
[00:32:59] and we talk about their business
[00:33:00] and how I can help them grow their business
[00:33:02] and we brainstorm and we come up.
[00:33:04] But the real important thing
[00:33:06] that you can start a meeting with
[00:33:08] is going around the room
[00:33:09] and talking about what one thing you're grateful for
[00:33:12] or one thing you're proud of.
[00:33:13] I learned that from an amazing business coach
[00:33:15] that I worked with, the guy named John Mark Shaw,
[00:33:17] who I've been working with for a bunch of years,
[00:33:18] he based in New York,
[00:33:20] give a shout out to John Lovehem, he's amazing.
[00:33:23] And that alone just shifts the whole room.
[00:33:27] People might be having a bad day or, you know,
[00:33:29] they woke up, you just don't know
[00:33:31] what people are showing up with.
[00:33:33] You know, they may not have slept well
[00:33:35] because they have a baby and it's,
[00:33:37] you know, they're up all night or
[00:33:38] their dog is sick or who knows, right?
[00:33:41] And like just focusing on one thing you're grateful for,
[00:33:43] one thing you're proud of can totally change your energy.
[00:33:45] And then when you get on that phone with the next call,
[00:33:49] you know, and you had a setback,
[00:33:52] there's like a pause and all of a sudden,
[00:33:53] you know, you don't bring that bad with you
[00:33:56] for the next call, you know.
[00:33:58] It's so important and I know we're spending a lot of time on this
[00:34:02] but I really think it is one of the most
[00:34:05] important skills for agents to learn
[00:34:08] is how to, you know, set themselves up for success.
[00:34:12] You know, people call it mindset,
[00:34:14] you know, whatever you want to call it,
[00:34:16] just being able to prime yourself
[00:34:18] so that you're in the best possible place
[00:34:20] to serve your clients and serve your,
[00:34:22] your own business as well.
[00:34:24] So I could not, I could not agree with you more
[00:34:27] and it's the reason this podcast existed
[00:34:30] for the exact same reason as I want people to realize
[00:34:33] agents who are struggling that this path is,
[00:34:36] is possible and, you know,
[00:34:38] 500 episodes later, thankfully,
[00:34:40] people are listening and we appreciate that.
[00:34:43] And so we're so grateful to people like Scott
[00:34:45] because, you know, a lot of times too,
[00:34:47] I think it's easy to sort of forget
[00:34:50] that top producers still are doing a lot of the same activities
[00:34:54] that a brand new agent will be doing.
[00:34:56] They have more experience, they're able to
[00:34:58] do it at a different scale.
[00:35:00] But I suspect Scott, I bet a lot of the same things you do today
[00:35:05] are things you did 20 years ago.
[00:35:06] And by the way, yes, yes, like I think, you know,
[00:35:11] if there's some simple thing I do,
[00:35:12] when I think of someone, I send them a text.
[00:35:15] When I see something and I'm like,
[00:35:16] oh, I think of that person, I just do it.
[00:35:18] I don't, there's no like, make a list and then do it.
[00:35:20] Like if it takes two seconds, I do it
[00:35:22] and that's the way I've always been.
[00:35:24] I mean, I do have ADHD.
[00:35:26] It's like, oh, I have an idea.
[00:35:27] Let's do it.
[00:35:27] But if it's simple, I do it.
[00:35:29] But I want to say something because
[00:35:31] if you're out there, you're like, oh, this guy,
[00:35:33] you know, sold a bunch of real estate
[00:35:34] and, you know, he's really got to figure it out.
[00:35:36] I am stressed out.
[00:35:37] I make mistakes left, right in center,
[00:35:39] you know, I have plenty of deals that die,
[00:35:42] that fall apart and I make, you know,
[00:35:44] I say the wrong thing, I all the time
[00:35:46] and I call myself out in front of the team
[00:35:49] as much as I can because they need to know
[00:35:51] that it continues, you know, you have a bad day.
[00:35:56] You think, oh, I'm not good enough to get this piece,
[00:35:58] this listing and you talk yourself into some,
[00:36:00] all of those things, the self-talk, the negative self-talk,
[00:36:04] it just continues.
[00:36:05] You have to really be aware of it and work through it.
[00:36:08] Yes.
[00:36:09] The same things that, you know,
[00:36:11] that you might struggle with if you're a newer agent,
[00:36:15] everyone does it and everyone continues to make mistakes.
[00:36:18] And it's like, the more you just own it
[00:36:20] and the team appreciates when I talk about my mistakes,
[00:36:22] oh, I screwed this up.
[00:36:23] Sure.
[00:36:23] Oh, my God, I screwed this up.
[00:36:25] We launched a listing with the wrong price recently.
[00:36:27] I was like, oh, God, like, I can't believe I did that.
[00:36:30] Just stuff that you, you have to call yourself out
[00:36:34] because it makes people feel like
[00:36:36] they can be successful and they don't have to be perfect.
[00:36:40] You know, and that's such a relief.
[00:36:43] Such a relief.
[00:36:44] Like, you're a human, you make mistakes, I get it, I do it too, right?
[00:36:48] And that's the team is held to account,
[00:36:50] but not held to perfection.
[00:36:54] Yeah, I actually think successful people fail more
[00:36:57] than non-successful people.
[00:36:59] I really do because I think once,
[00:37:02] when I say fail, I mean, making a mistake and error,
[00:37:05] you know, whatever that looks like,
[00:37:08] because it's the only way we actually learn,
[00:37:10] we learn via mistake.
[00:37:12] You know, when we do something that we already know how to do,
[00:37:14] that just sort of, you know, just validates what we already know.
[00:37:17] We don't, it's not much of a learning opportunity,
[00:37:20] but when we make a mistake, that's where wisdom comes in
[00:37:22] and that's where Scott has 20 years of making mistakes.
[00:37:28] Which, and again, I say that in the most respectful way possible,
[00:37:31] I mean, Scott, if we look at his track record
[00:37:35] and his team's track record, you know, billion dollars sold,
[00:37:37] these guys know what they're doing
[00:37:39] and they make lots of mistakes along the way,
[00:37:42] but they keep going and they keep learning.
[00:37:45] And that's the thing is I almost think,
[00:37:49] if you can learn to get excited about making mistakes,
[00:37:52] then you'll be in a little bit of a better position
[00:37:54] because they won't be so devastating when they happen.
[00:37:57] You know, I make, but we have 800 agents here.
[00:38:00] I make mistakes every single day.
[00:38:03] Terrible mistakes. Terrible mistakes.
[00:38:05] And yet, and yet, yet here we are.
[00:38:09] And, you know, our brokerage continues to grow,
[00:38:12] Scott's as well.
[00:38:14] So, you know, it's not about not making mistakes,
[00:38:17] as Scott said, you know, nobody's perfect.
[00:38:19] But realizing that the mistake is actually the opportunity
[00:38:23] to then, you know, correct something for the future.
[00:38:26] So it's actually get excited about your errors,
[00:38:28] your mistakes, listeners, because that's where the real growth happens.
[00:38:32] Yeah, there's lots to learn.
[00:38:34] I mean, whenever we have a deal die,
[00:38:36] or like we lose a bidding war,
[00:38:38] or whatever you can want to consider,
[00:38:40] you can either consider it like this is the fail, right?
[00:38:43] Something that happened, you're like, wait a minute,
[00:38:44] like what did I learn through that?
[00:38:47] You know, we have, I mean,
[00:38:48] and there's so much out of your control anyway,
[00:38:50] you lose a pitch.
[00:38:51] Okay, what was there to be learned there?
[00:38:53] You know, if you bat 50% on your pitches,
[00:38:56] you're doing incredibly well.
[00:38:59] We're going, you know, it's,
[00:39:00] you're going to win some,
[00:39:02] sometimes somebody has a relationship with the cousin,
[00:39:03] and they're going to win the listing, no matter how,
[00:39:05] they're like, we love you.
[00:39:06] But if I hire you, my wife's going to divorce me,
[00:39:09] like that's just the way it goes, you know,
[00:39:11] and you're like, okay, I get it.
[00:39:13] And is that a fail?
[00:39:14] No, it's like you just, you chalk it up.
[00:39:16] And maybe there's going to be an opportunity
[00:39:17] where they refer you to someone else.
[00:39:20] You know, yeah, there, there's,
[00:39:22] there's always other opportunities,
[00:39:24] because of course, with real estate,
[00:39:26] everyone's got to live somewhere, right?
[00:39:28] So this idea of, you know,
[00:39:30] there isn't a finite pie really in this, in this business,
[00:39:34] there's so much opportunity.
[00:39:36] But you do have to sort of, you know,
[00:39:38] have the correct questions
[00:39:40] that you might be asking yourself
[00:39:42] or questions that will lead you into opportunity.
[00:39:45] And that's really what Scott's talking about
[00:39:47] is being super mindful of your thoughts,
[00:39:50] you know, what's coming in,
[00:39:52] what you're saying to yourself,
[00:39:53] how you're treating yourself.
[00:39:55] And then of course, you know,
[00:39:57] how you're, you know,
[00:39:59] interacting with clients as well.
[00:40:01] Scott, let's talk about client winning business,
[00:40:05] because I think, you know, at your level,
[00:40:09] you know, you're dealing with certainly,
[00:40:12] you know, you're working in the most,
[00:40:15] arguably the most difficult market in the country.
[00:40:17] And there's lots of competition,
[00:40:20] lots of great agents in New York City,
[00:40:22] you being one of them.
[00:40:23] But there being lots of other really fantastic agents.
[00:40:26] I've had a lot of them,
[00:40:27] even from Brown Hairsteevans on my show.
[00:40:29] So I know how the competition is out there.
[00:40:32] How do you think about competition?
[00:40:35] And when you're maybe up against,
[00:40:37] I assume it happens in listing presentations,
[00:40:41] maybe you're up against other agents,
[00:40:42] maybe even agents you know.
[00:40:44] How do you sort of approach that?
[00:40:46] Because I know that that can be very stressful for agents.
[00:40:49] Well, first, of course,
[00:40:52] you're going up against other agents in a lot of situations.
[00:40:55] That's just, I mean, if I were looking to buy a car,
[00:40:58] I'm looking at multiple cars, right?
[00:41:00] I mean, yes.
[00:41:01] You're trying different things.
[00:41:03] So I think any good seller is going to do a little bit of due diligence.
[00:41:07] I think that's actually great.
[00:41:09] I have a couple of answers to this.
[00:41:12] One, and some people are going to,
[00:41:15] I don't know how they're going to react,
[00:41:16] but I actually don't think of everyone as competition.
[00:41:19] I mean, during COVID, I was putting out video after video
[00:41:22] to the entire brokerage community,
[00:41:24] about how technology we could use to go
[00:41:26] and because we were totally shut down for a few months there.
[00:41:29] And I was like, oh, you can use this video service to do shoots.
[00:41:32] And you can do this.
[00:41:33] And let's try this because it's like,
[00:41:35] I believe that a rising tide lifts all boats.
[00:41:38] You know, the better, the more professional we are as a community,
[00:41:41] the more successful everyone is.
[00:41:43] Okay, so I think of,
[00:41:44] I want to establish the best relationships
[00:41:46] across the brokerage community.
[00:41:47] Because we, 20% of the agents do 80% of the business.
[00:41:51] That's just the nature of things.
[00:41:53] So I just want to be great at what I do,
[00:41:56] knowing that it's going to help me somehow.
[00:42:00] And I want to help them do a good job.
[00:42:02] So I don't always think about everyone as competition.
[00:42:05] Sure.
[00:42:06] If you flip it and say, okay, I know I'm,
[00:42:08] I'm, they're meeting multiple people, right?
[00:42:11] It's like, what is, how do I really articulate what makes us different and special?
[00:42:15] And I'm like, okay, first we have a track record.
[00:42:17] I'm not trying to pat myself on the back.
[00:42:19] But if I don't say something, nobody else will,
[00:42:22] right?
[00:42:22] Right.
[00:42:22] 20 years of experience, lots of sales,
[00:42:24] and we have a great system to get this soul for you.
[00:42:27] But more than that, we care about you.
[00:42:30] And I've been referred, I can't tell you how many times I've been referred to people.
[00:42:34] Scott, we referred you because you're not a jerk.
[00:42:37] Right?
[00:42:37] And I mean, I know that's, may sound like simple,
[00:42:41] but I actually care about the people.
[00:42:43] I want to see them be successful.
[00:42:44] And that underpins everything.
[00:42:46] So the system is to create win-win.
[00:42:49] It's like, I'm not, if you're looking for somebody to rip off,
[00:42:52] you know, rip off somebody's face, that's like a phrase, you know, like,
[00:42:55] really take advantage and like, you know, kill someone and get the best deal ever.
[00:43:01] That's not my approach.
[00:43:02] Do I, am I a good negotiator?
[00:43:04] Yes.
[00:43:04] Can I get great deals?
[00:43:05] Can I uncover great deals?
[00:43:07] Absolutely.
[00:43:08] But the approach is, how can I make this into a win-win situation?
[00:43:11] Because if you don't, they're going to find a way to get you later.
[00:43:16] I really think like big picture, if you can try,
[00:43:19] your intention is to create a win-win situation for us, a really happy buyer,
[00:43:25] and a happy seller.
[00:43:28] That's my assumption.
[00:43:30] How do I do that?
[00:43:31] Right?
[00:43:31] How can I say that?
[00:43:33] And it's the intention, which we'll get you further.
[00:43:36] And we're going to be super resourceful.
[00:43:39] We're going to be incredibly creative.
[00:43:42] In our marketing, we're branding your property.
[00:43:45] If we're representing a seller, you know, with a buyer, we're selling,
[00:43:48] we're selling the buyer as, you know, we've had people that we,
[00:43:53] there was no way they were getting someone who had a dog in a building that doesn't allow dogs.
[00:43:58] Okay?
[00:43:59] Pretty open and shut case, right?
[00:44:01] And we got them approved to buy and bring their little dog Benson into that property.
[00:44:05] Because we found the way around it.
[00:44:08] You know, can they go into the service, I mean, it was,
[00:44:10] they went to the service elevator and the dog couldn't go out, the regular entrance
[00:44:14] and whatever.
[00:44:15] It got a little crazy.
[00:44:16] But like, it's just how can we care enough to really find answers when other people say they can't be done?
[00:44:24] And that has served us really well, right?
[00:44:27] And the trackway could approve it.
[00:44:29] But if you, if you are new and you're just like, I really care,
[00:44:33] and I'm going to go learn, I'm going to study this inventory, like nobody's business,
[00:44:38] and I'm going to go, I'm going to know every building there is or I'm going to know all the
[00:44:42] comps that sold.
[00:44:43] I'm going to study the heck out of this.
[00:44:44] And when things close, I'm going to, you know, communicate that to people like, hey,
[00:44:48] look at this closing on your block.
[00:44:50] And you know, you're going to set up searches so that you just know more.
[00:44:54] You're already way ahead.
[00:44:57] Way ahead.
[00:44:58] Way ahead.
[00:44:58] What you just gave, you basically gave a pretty amazing,
[00:45:04] it might sound non-specific, but it's not, not specific.
[00:45:09] It is entirely specific.
[00:45:11] You just gave a great plan for anyone who is, you know,
[00:45:14] learn your inventory, you know, understand the market,
[00:45:17] you know, increase your skill set, your knowledge, and stay in touch with people.
[00:45:22] Yeah.
[00:45:22] Yeah, I mean, it's, and most importantly, care about them.
[00:45:26] You know, that's, that's the missing piece.
[00:45:28] I always think, I think caring wins the game most of the time.
[00:45:32] You know, there's going to be times where it's just a strictly a number situation.
[00:45:36] Yeah, those are, yeah, happens, I guess.
[00:45:38] But the vast majority of human beings who are going to employ you to buy or sell a home really want,
[00:45:45] you, they want to feel that you, that you care about them.
[00:45:48] And you can demonstrate that and you can demonstrate that over and over again,
[00:45:53] empathy, sympathy, checking in on that, making sure they know that you know what's going on
[00:45:58] in their lives, that you know what their goals are.
[00:46:00] And I know that's really important for you is you get really excited.
[00:46:03] And if you're not watching this live once, if you're not watching this visually,
[00:46:07] you're listening, Scott got really, really animated earlier when he was talking about,
[00:46:11] you know, working with his clients dreams.
[00:46:14] He got really, really excited because, because, and imagine,
[00:46:18] if you have a real estate agent, if you're not in this business and you need a real estate agent
[00:46:23] to buy or sell something, you wouldn't you want somebody who is really excited
[00:46:27] and at your dreams, right? So that's demonstrating care.
[00:46:33] And, and I think that, you know, Scott, that's just, it just oozes out of you.
[00:46:38] It also, if it's about caring, then it's, you're, people so often forget they're like on the,
[00:46:46] on the same side of the table, they sort of, they just forget that they're working with someone.
[00:46:52] You know, that they're, they're not working against someone.
[00:46:56] Everybody, you're helping someone, they so desperately want to sell this thing.
[00:47:00] They have an idea of what they want to do and it's about them, right?
[00:47:05] It just make it about them.
[00:47:07] Like, you go to a cocktail party and get super nervous because you're like,
[00:47:10] oh, I, you know, I don't know anybody and whatever.
[00:47:12] And the second you just get curious about the person you're talking to,
[00:47:15] all that melts away.
[00:47:17] It's like, you can't be fear, you can't be afraid and curious at the same time, right?
[00:47:21] Like, I've heard that before.
[00:47:22] I think it's very, yeah, that's true.
[00:47:23] Like, I want to learn about you.
[00:47:25] What are you about?
[00:47:27] And, and when you care, there's so much more forgiveness for little mistakes.
[00:47:32] You know, I care.
[00:47:33] I'm going to figure it out.
[00:47:34] We're going to brand this property.
[00:47:36] We're going to just, whatever we do.
[00:47:38] And it's, now and then it goes perfectly, right?
[00:47:41] You know, people, you know, like, okay, we had this deal.
[00:47:43] We had an exact, you know, strategy.
[00:47:44] We priced it here.
[00:47:45] We got a deal done.
[00:47:46] Blah, blah, blah.
[00:47:46] Vity war.
[00:47:47] It was amazing.
[00:47:48] And then a lot of the times, especially in markets like this,
[00:47:50] it takes a little bit longer.
[00:47:52] A lot of you got very used to in 19, in 2021,
[00:47:56] to like, things selling, over asking in one day.
[00:48:01] Good.
[00:48:01] Well, that was fun for a minute.
[00:48:03] You know, I was in Vegas last year and these LA,
[00:48:06] this Los Angeles agents were like, oh my god, it's like,
[00:48:08] I've got to hire more people.
[00:48:09] Like, I'm not sleeping my white, you know, it's crazy.
[00:48:12] My life is a jambals because it was, they were just so much business.
[00:48:16] But now it just comes down.
[00:48:18] There's never been a more important time
[00:48:20] to have a good system to manage this and to manage the people
[00:48:25] and all the potential, you know, the pitfalls of a market where
[00:48:29] mortgage rates are slightly higher than they were, you know, year and a half ago.
[00:48:34] Yes, slightly higher.
[00:48:36] And that can, and that could be a place where people get trapped.
[00:48:40] Agents can get in that mindset of high interest rates, low inventory,
[00:48:44] not as much opportunity.
[00:48:46] Well, okay.
[00:48:48] Yes, maybe.
[00:48:49] And let's shift our focus and start thinking about how do we demonstrate?
[00:48:55] One thing we can do is we can demonstrate care.
[00:48:57] I could reach out to every single person in my database over the next several months.
[00:49:02] Let them know I'm thinking about them to check in and see what's going on in their lives.
[00:49:06] You know, see what they're doing on social media and comment on it.
[00:49:10] And say, hey, I saw you just got back from a vacation.
[00:49:12] It looked awesome, you know, really excited for you or whatever.
[00:49:15] There's lots of ways you can demonstrate this.
[00:49:17] And, you know, if I was somebody without a listing today,
[00:49:22] without any listings today, what I might do is reach out to everybody I know and print out
[00:49:27] the zest of it from Zillow and say, hey, Zillow, things are homeless worth this.
[00:49:31] I actually think it might be slightly different, but I just wanted to share this with you.
[00:49:36] It'd give me a call and we can chat about it, right?
[00:49:38] That's an opportunity.
[00:49:39] People, there's always reasons to pick up the phone and call somebody and connect with them.
[00:49:44] And that's what this business is.
[00:49:45] It's really, it really is a service business.
[00:49:49] I mean, it's more service than it is anything.
[00:49:52] And like you said, we're on the same side of the table as the client.
[00:49:56] Like, how do we, how do we always keep that perspective, right?
[00:50:02] Well, I wanted, you were touching on, you know, something you can do.
[00:50:07] I don't think I mentioned yet.
[00:50:09] In New York, we have buildings.
[00:50:11] So somebody buys an apartment in a building.
[00:50:12] It's not hard for us to set up a search so that every time
[00:50:16] price comes available in that building, you can, it's information you can share with your client,
[00:50:22] right? And it's like, oh, you know, it's some of my high inclines.
[00:50:25] We've sold, you know, multi-million dollar properties in the building.
[00:50:27] It's very exciting when you see something that's selling at a higher price.
[00:50:30] But at the same, I've had a situation downtown last year where I'd sold an apartment to,
[00:50:35] to a client.
[00:50:37] And the same apartment came available at what I thought was an excellent price.
[00:50:42] And I said, I emailed my friend.
[00:50:44] I said, oh, this is such a, it's so interesting.
[00:50:46] I can't wait to see what this sells for.
[00:50:48] He immediately introduced me to his friend who wanted to buy that unit.
[00:50:53] I negotiated it without ever, I hadn't meet the client until about two months later.
[00:50:58] And we had, we put a deal together just because I was sharing that information
[00:51:02] with no expectation.
[00:51:03] I was like, oh, this will be neat just because I wanted him to know about it.
[00:51:07] But the other piece which I know I haven't talked about is the idea of telling stories,
[00:51:11] right?
[00:51:13] So if you have, even if one of the great things about having a team is that this team and
[00:51:18] some of the agents are new, they get to hear every single, we've sold maybe, I think, 80 apartments
[00:51:23] this year, 80 deals in New York. That can be a pretty big volume.
[00:51:30] Some people sell 300, 400 homes and God bless you for being able to do that.
[00:51:34] That's incredible.
[00:51:36] But every, the every agent on the team can own those stories as their own.
[00:51:40] And every, every of the week, we take an hour and we talk about like three different case studies
[00:51:45] of like, what did you do right that success? And then every other week we do,
[00:51:49] whatever the challenges you overcame. But the idea is that you evolve.
[00:51:54] What are these stories of things that are happening today? Because people love to hear about wins.
[00:52:00] And it's like, you're not bragging. You're just like, oh, we just help this client,
[00:52:03] you know, put a dog in there in a non, in a building where no dogs are allowed. That was so exciting.
[00:52:08] Or we help someone get a great deal on this building. That sale was a million dollars less than
[00:52:14] the last one that traded. That's like, I want to hear that. Tell me more about that Scott.
[00:52:19] So those are, if you have good stories, share the stories. Not people, what's the question
[00:52:25] in cocktail parties in New York? How's the market? Well, well, actually, the prices are up 4%.
[00:52:31] No, like, tell a story. Just tell the story about something. Well, we were helping this buyer.
[00:52:36] And, you know, they're excited about this neighborhood. You know, we got, we got a deal done here.
[00:52:41] We were having a lot of success in this neighborhood. You know, why do you ask? What's, you know,
[00:52:46] what are you thinking about? Like, there's so many ways you can answer without the boring market data
[00:52:51] information. You know, that is a really great, great tip. Definitely have stories to share that are
[00:53:02] authentic to you that are impactful to you and that you have passion about so that when you do
[00:53:07] get asked those questions, because that is the first question that anyone asks when, you know,
[00:53:12] when somebody says, oh, I've been real estate. Oh, how's the market, right? That you're absolutely
[00:53:15] right. The number most commonly asked question. And you can answer that with whatever facts and
[00:53:21] figures you have. But Scott is absolutely right. Have some personal examples of things that you
[00:53:27] are currently working on or have done. And this is a great, I think, you know, Scott, you said
[00:53:32] something also very powerful. Like, after every deal you guys go through and say, okay, what, what,
[00:53:37] well, what, what were there, where were their challenges or opportunities for growth or, or,
[00:53:41] you know, was there a story here that we can, we can work with, you know, just basically working
[00:53:46] through the transaction after it's done and finding those, those magic moments and maybe the
[00:53:52] challenging moments and then learning from the challenging moments and then really celebrating
[00:53:56] the magic moments. I mean, it's great for marketing. It's great for keeping the team spirit up
[00:54:03] and also just, you know, continuing to service the client. I love that. Thanks. It's fun. It's fun
[00:54:10] to do that. It's much more interesting than we just did a webinar with an economist and, you know,
[00:54:16] a mortgage broker and this wonderful data. And it was, we were talking about the market, but like,
[00:54:22] what really came to life is the stories. What are we seeing in the market? The actual deals.
[00:54:27] That's where people can wrap their heads around it. Yeah, I could not, I could not agree with you
[00:54:34] more. I 100% a big fan of learn how to tell stories. I actually, it was funny. You just reminded me
[00:54:40] of a interview I had once with an agent in Florida who sells mega, mega properties like 30 million
[00:54:49] plus kind of, you know, it's just a different sort of whole thing. And he, you know, because when
[00:54:57] he sells those types of properties, of course, there's a whole teams that are involved that you have
[00:55:02] to work with and there's a lot more people involved in the transaction, a lot more complication
[00:55:06] usually. However, he said it was really funny. He goes, well, it's all about storytelling, meaning
[00:55:15] it's all about, you know, he goes, when I show a perspective buyer this property, I want to know
[00:55:21] what their vision is for the property. And I want to tell them the story of this property and really
[00:55:27] sell them on it. And that he goes, that's really all I do. He goes, I tell the story. And I,
[00:55:33] unite stories basically, which I thought was really a smart idea.
[00:55:38] Scott, one other thing too, so we talked about providing value. I'm curious, what are you doing
[00:55:46] to celebrate your clients after a transaction? How do you stay in touch with people after?
[00:55:53] You know, that's, it's, it's, it's a great question. And I think a lot of people don't think
[00:56:06] and you know, we, we, it's, there's no one size fits all gift. Although a gift is nice.
[00:56:14] You know, it's, it's, it's an acknowledgement of a milestone, something happened here.
[00:56:19] That was important enough that we wanted to say thank you for entrusting us for like the biggest
[00:56:24] transaction probably in your life. Now in New York, that's not always true. You know, people are,
[00:56:29] you know, doing multi-billion dollar deals in their jobs and this is like a place to live for them
[00:56:34] and it happens to be five million dollars. It doesn't matter. You know, those people, I always,
[00:56:40] you know, that I'm going to botch the quote from that movie Notting Hill, but at some point,
[00:56:44] you're just a girl standing in front of a boy, hoping that, you know, he's going to love her, right?
[00:56:49] Yeah, yeah, ask your to like her or whatever. And that's really, it doesn't matter what the price is.
[00:56:54] This is a sacred moment for people. And so what's the gift? What's the gift? What is going to
[00:57:00] touch someone? Maybe it's a donation to a charity that you know they support. That's easy to find.
[00:57:06] And people don't, we do that. Somebody is a runner and they want, we want to support the Central
[00:57:10] Park Conservancy on their behalf. Okay. Sometimes it's, it's just some beautiful roses, you know,
[00:57:17] it's something simple like that. It's, it's certainly not always alcohol, not everybody drinks,
[00:57:23] right? Of bottle of champagne. Sure. It's pretty, it's pretty boring sometimes. Sometimes it's,
[00:57:27] it depends on the person. So like take the moment to, to, to, to master, to mastermind with your team.
[00:57:32] What do we think them the best thing for them is take them out to lunch or take them out to dinner,
[00:57:37] do something to acknowledge this in banks. They have these celebratory closing dinners.
[00:57:43] You know, it, it, connect on a personal level. I know it's sometimes a little bit weird. Hey,
[00:57:48] can we get together after the closing? But do it. Find a way to connect with people. But we also
[00:57:53] celebrate every, every, once a week, we have a meeting as a team and we go through what are
[00:57:57] our celebrations. And I think that people, especially, you know, type A, I can speak for myself.
[00:58:04] The closing happens and you're like, you don't even, even take five seconds to celebrate it for
[00:58:07] yourself. Think about what you can do. The people that you help. So celebrate for yourself,
[00:58:13] celebrate with your team, celebrate with your clients. Give them the, the room to be happy about
[00:58:19] what it is. Because it's like they've just achieved something big. Maybe this is like their,
[00:58:24] their lifelong dream, right? There's a reason they call it a dream house. Take a second to,
[00:58:29] to really let that soak in. Yeah. And also every year on the anniversary, you can relive that,
[00:58:39] that moment. And you can remind them of that moment. And you can reach out and, and check in and
[00:58:45] say, Hey, it's a year, you know, a year to the day that you bought that property. How's it
[00:58:51] working for you? I just wanted to check in and see how it's going. If you're having any problems
[00:58:54] with anything, I let me know. I can help you get it stuff. Thanks, Neville. But just excited.
[00:58:59] It's been a whole year, you know, and that sort of excitement and passion that I'm sort of
[00:59:05] speaking for Scott Scott, obviously speaks for himself. But you can hear the passion in Scott's
[00:59:11] voice. So I just love this, this conversation because I think what we're really talking about is,
[00:59:18] is yeah, just being into your clients, get into your clients, like be into them, you know,
[00:59:22] be into what they're into, you know, get excited about what they're excited about, help support
[00:59:27] their stuff and their vision, their dreams. And boy, they're going to be with you for life. I mean,
[00:59:32] that's all we really want. I wanted to, something I learned a few years ago, I just never thought
[00:59:38] about it this way. We all get referrals, right? And we say thank you when they come in. And,
[00:59:44] you know, if we, if there's a referral from another agent, it's like my favorite thing to do is
[00:59:47] to write that it's very easy to celebrate because you're writing a big check to someone who
[00:59:50] referred you this client. Thank you so much. It's amazing, you know, and for those brokers out in
[00:59:55] the, in the rest of the country, it's like our favorite thing to do. We send so much business.
[00:59:59] It's like we've done 15 deals in Pittsburgh this year for some reason. We've, you know,
[01:00:04] referred that much out and Florida and Connecticut and all over the place. But, but if someone thinks
[01:00:09] enough of you to refer you, I keep them and I keep them in touch. And then, you know, what is that
[01:00:15] thank you that happens at the end of the transaction to them? Sometimes it's, it's, I don't want to
[01:00:20] put a dollar number on it, but is there something special you can do say a let a handwritten letter?
[01:00:25] But the little nuance, which I loved was like, okay, this deal came from here. And what was the,
[01:00:31] what was the parent of that referral and what was the grandparent? And can you go back how far and
[01:00:36] say, you know, I, I did a rental deal in 2003 and that turned into 40 or 50 million dollars of
[01:00:44] business over time. And I go back and say, you know, I wish I want to say thank you for trusting
[01:00:50] as this new agent who co-incalled you when the classified ads were still a thing in the New
[01:00:55] York Times because that I just closed another deal because of our relationship from 20 years ago.
[01:01:01] And I just wanted to say thank you and it's like, so I'm so full of gratitude because I can really
[01:01:06] trace it back. And if you take a moment for that, like I, I'm feeling so grateful right now, just
[01:01:13] little bit like John, this artist who hired me years and years ago, I had no experience. I had no
[01:01:18] business, you know, almost no business doing that deal, but it turned into so much more. And you
[01:01:24] can go in every direction and think about all of the different ways that you have gotten to where
[01:01:29] you've gotten and just stand there for a second and say, who should I be thank? Who should I thank
[01:01:34] right now? Yeah. And boy, I was feeling grateful for the for the gentleman back in 2003 who took
[01:01:43] a chance on you as well because obviously it's it's birthed this amazing career that you are now
[01:01:50] in. And that is it is such a great suggestion. Let's appreciate the people in our lives and let them
[01:01:58] know how appreciative we are because we are to them. That is really the key. It's got you,
[01:02:06] it's funny. We're this is a bit of a different kind of episode that we normally do. We're talking
[01:02:12] a little bit more about emotional stuff. And but I think this is really what wins the game. And so
[01:02:18] you know, care about people tell them how much they mean to you. You know, we know how much
[01:02:23] homes mean to people. So we want to we want to continue on with this, you know, increase intimacy,
[01:02:29] I think is is the key to this business. And that's through a lot of effort and caring consideration.
[01:02:35] Scott, I think it's a great place for us to wrap up. I want to mention for anyone listening
[01:02:40] who is an agent in in Manhattan, also Brooklyn, Scott's team covers both both Manhattan and Brooklyn.
[01:02:47] If you are looking to maybe see what other options exist this year, maybe you're not getting the
[01:02:52] attention you deserve or just want to see, you know, what other teams are offering reach out to
[01:02:57] Scott and may or may not be a good fit. But he would love the opportunity to say hello and see if
[01:03:04] maybe you could be a good addition to the team. Also, if you are an agent elsewhere in the country
[01:03:10] and you have clients that come to and from New York City, we of course know New York City can be a
[01:03:17] very transient place. People can go there and then leave. Well, of course, Scott needs people to
[01:03:23] refer to as well. And he would love to hear me your referrals as well. So reach out to Scott. The
[01:03:29] best way to reach him is to visit him on his website, which is Harris residential.com. And then
[01:03:37] you can also find him on linked in Scott Harris. Let's definitely follow him. He posts almost daily
[01:03:43] on linked in with really great content there. So let's let's follow. He's kind of really impressive
[01:03:49] following there. But on behalf of our audience, Scott, I want to thank you for your time today. You
[01:03:54] were amazing guest. This is the exact kind of conversations I love having. And you really provided
[01:04:01] a lot of value. So thank you on behalf of the audience. On behalf of Scott and myself, we want to
[01:04:06] thank the audience as well. Thank you for sticking around to the end of the episode. Thank you for
[01:04:10] supporting our show. The best way you can help us is by telling a friend, think of one other agent
[01:04:15] that is maybe struggling this year and maybe just needs a little boost. Send them a link to this

DJ, thanks for having me and hello from New York. Hello from Chicago and hello to all of our listeners from all over. Scott really excited to chat with you. I love when I get to talk to somebody who has approaching the billion dollar mark or I think you guys have exceeded that. You're having an amazing year. We were talking offline and Scott, his team is having their best year ever. This is 2023. I want to just make sure if somebody's listening to this at a different time. This is a tough year for most agents, but Scott and his team are crushing it. So we're excited to find out maybe what they're doing and what our listeners can learn from Scott. I'd love to really start at the beginning of your journey into real estate. So what brought you to real estate? Well, I grew up in New Orleans and my family, my father had warehouses. He still runs a wholesale hardware business. So I spent a lot of sick days or summer vacation days in his warehouse running around doing stuff. My best friend and I were riding bikes in the warbs on the Mississippi River down by the French Quarter. If you've ever been down there. Sure. And my mom ended up in high school being the marketing director for a Merrill Lynch affiliate. So there's like a lot of commercial and residential real estate in my background. And for me, it was all about the architecture and design. I loved all the old Spanish and French architecture of the French Quarter. My very best friend was there and I was sort of steeped in it and then did nothing with real estate for years. I was touring musician for the better part of my 20s doing sales on one side, booking bands and then on the other side, being on the road. And when I finally decided I needed to make a move. I was in Boston at the time. I moved to New York and my stepmother. And as you may have people in your lives who know you better than you know yourself, they're like, Scott, I think you would be a great real estate agent. And it's not something that I ever thought about. I actually found my college application recently and it said, I think I want to get into something to do with architecture. And I was like, huh, that's pretty funny. So I ended up here and sure enough that that first year real estate, when I moved to New York, I had no job, no place to live, no girlfriend, nothing. And just kind of contacts and a real passion wanting to be successful. And it was like a duck to water. Real estate was just, I got my license. It started doing rentals, which is something you can really dive into in New York because it's so much of the business, so much of what people live in here. And it's just been brick by brick building the business over 20 years. It's amazing. As a musician, so tell us about a musician, what instruments did you play? So if you know like pentatonics, you know, some of those aqua, sure. It was like a boy band for aqua, in the late 90s, we used to open for bands like NSYNC and 98 degrees and amazing, crazy and ridiculous. And we were, you know, wearing all of, you know, you can just imagine what we were wearing. And all of that, it was a lot of fun. I think I had blue hair for a while. It was hilarious. And so I was a singer. That was amazing. And singer and dancer I'm guessing probably a lot of. I can move a little bit. I would say the dancing is like, I don't know how much of the threat I'm going to be on anybody's dance floor. But definitely had a lot of time, a lot of fun jumping around. That's for sure. A lot of energy. That's amazing. I love that. So really, I want to sort of dive in. You know, maybe people just dive into, you know, the success you guys have been having this year because I'm always impressed with success. And, you know, I think our, the whole purpose of our podcast is to talk about people who are successful anyway. That, of course, you are having a great year. You and your team. By the way, I want to mention real quickly before we get started, I usually save this to the end and then I forget to do it often. But if you are an agent in the New York City area, if you're working Manhattan, maybe Brooklyn, you know, really anywhere in New York and you are interested in maybe looking to see what other teams have to, what they have to offer. Maybe you're not getting the right attention or training or support from your existing firm. Brown hair, Stevens, of course, is a absolutely super reputable firm. One of the big, big firms in the country, but Scott Harris and his team would love the opportunity to chat with you. So just keep that in mind as we're talking because Scott, this team is doing really well this year and they're expanding. So keep it in mind. But, but, Scott, yeah, let's talk about what, how, how are you guys having such a great year? What do you think you're doing that is, that is paying off right now? Well, first I think it's in terms of how we think about the business big picture. It's all about helping. It's all about service to our clients. So in a moment where you may not be doing as many transactions, I never think about, you're saying, oh, they're doing great this year. All of that is just the last, the only thing you can see at the end. It's the lag, they call it like lag measures, right? It's exactly right, right? Lead measures are how are we adding value to clients? And so if you're every person listening, you have something special about you. You have some, you come from, you know, whether you're, whatever you did before, I found like school teachers who become real estate agents are the most amazing. They're so patient and they can really create good boundaries and like be good listeners. So that's just one example, actors, singers, performers, that's one side of it. They're great salespeople, but who are, you know, therapists? We're like therapists and real estate is just the vehicle, right? It's a, it's a people business. And so what we've been doing for 20 years is developing relationships across every imaginable industry. And so when I sit down with my client, I'm just listening. What are the things they need? How can I help them across the board? And I just found that the more value you add for your client, I want to introduce you to this person. I want to introduce you to this person with absolutely no expectations of what it's going to turn into. Has I know that that is the, that's the foundation for our success. And it just keeps, it's like an evergreen thing, you know, you start January 1st. Oh, I have, I have to do this whole thing again. But what you've already done is just connect to your clients and be that person that they call for everything. Yeah. And how does that relate to like a very specific, you know, we're helping someone sell an apartment, helping someone buy. We really take an A to Z approach. It's like any buyer setting the table above and beyond. I mean, anything you need, you can be based in Asia or in the Middle East or Europe or wherever you are. We can take care of every single thing to do with the preparation of your home. Above and beyond in terms of communication, our team is 11, but our extended team is 50, 100, 200 trusted people that we can go to and make sure that we get things done. So it's, it's a combination of the actual deal making where we really are focused on taking care of everything. And that just establishes this huge amount of trust. But I think it's also big picture. How can we serve our clients? Even when they're not clients, everybody, everybody, it's not about, hey, do you ever referral for me? Because you hear that thing all the time. That's the best compliment you can give. Blah, blah, blah. Because that's what I mean. And it's great advice for anybody who's ever read the million dollar real estate agent. That is a great source of language. Like to think about how you can, you know, how you can cultivate referrals. But it's much easier than that. Just get into conversation with lots of people and ultimately you're going to help them in some way. And then they're going to, they're never going to forget you. Maybe that's generic. I mean, I can get, I can get more detailed about how it's helped this year. I always think the fundamentals win the game. So what you're talking about is really consistent with almost everyone I've ever had on the show who are all top 1% producers in the country. So is it unique? No, but success usually isn't unique. It's usually the action that is taken, you know, consistently. And obviously you guys are doing that. And I do want to dive into it a little deeper because I'm curious. You mentioned, you know, providing value even when someone's not a client. So this, this is for our listeners, this could be, you know, before they're ready to use you. They've never used you before, but you want to start building that trust and building that, that relationship or they have already used you. And they're, you know, in between transactions. And that may be seven, 10 years, whatever it is in your local market. And I suspect Scott, you guys have an approach to handle both of those scenarios when you meet somebody first and then after a transaction, you know, sort of how you stay in touch. So I'd love to hear more about how you guys continue to add value. Well, I would say it's like chicken or the egg, right? If you're starting, if you're new in the business, what can you do? You want to make a list. Who are the 50 people in your life that are your biggest fans, right? And start just being consistent. It doesn't have to be 50 calls a day, but can it be five? Can it be five reaches out reaches to every single day? It's the consistency. It's just like going to the gym. It's like any kind of consistency you can build in your calendar just to reach out. I mean, yesterday, right? And it can be very intuitive. You have this list in front of you. It can be very old school looking at the list. Who are the five people that pop out of that list when you look at it? I reached out to five people yesterday. One person told me his, somebody in his family passed away and they're going to hire me to sell their place in, you know, in the spring. I haven't talked to him in probably a year. And I just, hey, how are you? I was in your building. Oh, well, building. I was thinking about you. And that was just my connection point. Somebody else I hadn't spoken to in a year. He popped out of the list. I said, let me reach out to so and so. And he said, oh, I'm looking to buy and flip something in the city. We ran, we're finished our projects in Connecticut. We're ready to come back in the city. There are opportunities. And that's just yesterday. So you have your top 50 people. You reach out to them and just listen. I think the most important thing you can do is, is just the agenda is, I want to connect with this person. I care about this person. They care about me. It's so much more fundamentally about the people. And if you really just focus on that, something good comes out of it. You're going to find a way to be of service to them. I mean, my fundamental, for those of you who might be in like a networking group, like a BNI or any kind of networking group across the country, they're amazing. It's all about giving with no expectation. And then knowing that it's going to come back from everywhere. And that's, that has been, that's just how I am. I want to help people out. I want to listen for ways to help them. But it's just doing that on a consistent basis, will ultimately get the ball rolling. Yeah, I agree. And I think it's kind of the most fun part of the job for a lot of agents, which is, I get to help people first. And I'm doing that for free. And it might look different to each particular contact or client. Maybe I'm connecting somebody with somebody who does roofing or I'm connecting somebody with a dentist or helping somebody start to think about where their next home might be because of schooling and they have children. Or whatever, just it could be anything. But maybe the transaction isn't today. But providing that kind of guidance and assistance is really what every person in this world wants. We want people to come with ideas to us and people to listen to our challenges. And there aren't many professions other than therapists, maybe attorneys, doctors, I guess, who really get to know their clients. And I think real estate is one of those professions where you really get a deep dive into somebody and that allows you to build more intimate relationships with people. But like Scott was saying, you really have to go first and you have to pick up the phone. And I love the fact that we have social media now to help us give us those contact points like Scott was saying, he's just calling, hey, how's it going? I was in your building. LinkedIn is a great place to find out what's going on with someone's professional life. You can see if there's any news about their company. You can see if they've had a promotion. You can even see when their birthday is that kind of thing. And you can just pick up the phone and say, hey, I was on LinkedIn. I saw you just got a promotion. Like that's a contact point, right? So there's so much opportunity to pick up the phone and call and talk with people. And I want to talk, Scott, I want to pivot a little bit to talking about believing in your clients. I know that's a big thing for you. So sort of walk us through, what does that mean to you and how do you create this sort of safe place for them to be able to share their lives with you? So I want to give a shout out. I listen to a lot of a guy named Ed Mylett who has this wonderful podcast. He's just terrific. And I'm not cribbing from him, but he said something recently, which I think is just it's how we run our business. It's I see the potential in people and more than that. When I sit down with someone and we get on the phone or even have a Zoom, right? That I'm listening to what their dreams are. I'm like a, I can eat your old kid listening to his parents. If the parent says, hey, I'm writing a book or hey, I'm starting a business. Hey, I'm opening a restaurant. Little Johnny doesn't say, well, what if the, you know, what if I, he can't raise the money and what if I can't work out a deal with the landlord and, you know, what if, I don't know what I'm doing. Little Johnny just believes that his parents are, you know, his dad or mom is starting this business and they're, they just, it's going to happen. It is already real, right? So what I don't know how I've maintained this sort of innocent belief in people, but it is that simple. Someone says, I want to do this. I'm like, it's happening. I, we are going to make it happen. I don't know how and I'm not worried about how. I have 20 years of experience. We will figure out how along the way, but it's going to happen because you, we've created a space where I really hear what it is you want. And they're things you might say, they're things you might not say. I'm listening for both. And we're starting to create this vision for what buyers are looking for or sellers, what's next for them. And it's sort of, you know, I have four pillars of what I call visionary brokerage. The first one is understanding, like, who are you? It's not about your properties. It's just who are you? What made you fall in love with where you live? What are you looking to do? And it's this fundamental belief in people that they can, that we can help them do it is like the most important. And then we add wisdom on top. That's our second pillar. And then we can have all these insights. You know, the way we run the business is create this system. You know, all of the, I have an amazing operations person out, give a shout out to Karen, who does, she's incredible and a transaction coordinator who's broke and she's incredible. So we have the system, the structure in place. But it allows for all this intuition where we can just have this crazy idea of like, hey, maybe we should, you want to look on the West side of Manhattan. We have this idea, what about this thing over here? And we just have to trust honor that, like, that intuition that sort of comes out of nowhere because we've created the space where it happens. And I can pause there, but it's, some people say it sounds a little woo-woo, you know, a little, you know, but I really think it's about having the structure in place so that magic happens. Really? You are, you are so 100% right. And it's not, it's not woo-woo, it's, it's just harder to measure, right? So intuition is hard to sort of understand, but we all have had experiences. And it's been my experience throughout life that my intuition is usually right. I won't say it's 100% right, but it's usually right. Maybe 80%, maybe not, maybe it's higher than that. And if that's true, then I have a really valuable resource inside of me. However, I have to get quiet enough to, or create a container where that intuition is free to, to spring forth, right? And so Scott is talking about doing this themselves because he's right. There are times where, you know, gosh, there's nothing on the East side, but we have this other thing over there. And it sort of feels like it might be a fit for them. And even though it's not really what they're looking for, it feels like it might be. So, you know, those are kind of ideas that spring forth. It reminds me of that old saying as a musician, you'll appreciate this. It's not the notes that make the music. It's the space between the notes. It's actually the silence between the notes that creates sound. Otherwise, it would just be one blaring sound. So what we're doing is what Scott's really talking about is creating an environment where intuition can thrive. And that is, yes, maybe it sounds a little new agey, but it boy, it's powerful. And just about every REALTOR I've talked to talks about their intuition. They trust their gut. Well, I think the part that people forget is it's your job to create, like, I think of us as like, we're the captains of the ship, right? We're steering it. And they're all, you just forget. Unless you put yourself through it every now and then just how stressful this is, right? Think about people, the most stressful things in people's lives are losing a loved one, getting divorced and moving, right? Maybe, you know, the new job, losing your job. But like, we encounter people at their most stressed. Yes. Job one is to like really be calm and be the space when they come in contact with you. Everything swirling around, you're like in the middle and like, it's all good, right? It's like, you have to, however you get there, yoga, zumba, meditation, whatever it takes, go running. I don't, you know, I do a few of those different things, but whatever gets you so that when people come in contact with you, they're like, okay, this person knows what they're doing. And I trust them because when things are crazy, they just settle in. Like, oh, wait, we can find a solution here. And yeah, the idea of this healthy power, you don't get sucked into the drama. And so many agents do. And of course, I mean, have I ever, have I yelled probably this week at somebody, right? Maybe not, but, you know, it's just so easy to lose your temper when the stress level's high. And you really want to close this deal. Oh my god, it's like everything is weighing on getting this one deal closed, especially in a harder market. But you have to be like, wait a minute. Like that, it's going to happen the way it's going to happen. It's going to, it's not this one. It'll be the next one. But it's like, how can I just stay calm? Right. You're so, so absolutely right. I really want to step on this point because as real estate professionals, we forget oftentimes what it's like for the consumer. And the consumer isn't always sharing how stressed they are because there is, it's a vulnerable thing sometimes to say to a real estate agent. Maybe you're working with for the very first time and you're going through a transaction. And, you know, the consumer is stressed about a particular bump in the road along the way. And, you know, maybe they're sharing it with their agent or maybe they're trying to just tough it out going, you know, but realistically, we know that, you know, real estate transactions are stressful. And it doesn't help if the real estate agent that you're employing is also feeling that same level of stress. So, right, the real estate agent is there to calm the situation, reduce the activation, help solve those problems. And so, you're so right. Is whatever you need to do to reduce your activation, staying out of the drama, you know, processing whatever, you know, negative stuff is flowing through you. And it flows through all of us. It happens like you were saying, you know, we all get angry, sad, scared. And learning how to manage those emotions more effectively. So, we can show up and be that for our clients who are going to need it the most. Can I give you an example of something that just happened? Please. So, yesterday, we've got a, I mean, it's the scale. I think it's like, if it gets overwhelming to you, if you're listening, it's like just remove a zero, right? This is like a three and a half million dollar deal. And the buyers say, I'm stressed already. Oh my god, you know, this is going to be such a big deal. It's like, okay. And the buyer came to us and we were asking all these concessions. It's a new building. And the buyer said, I want you to give us, we're already given a small concession on our commission to get to just finalize the deal. And they asked for, they were, it wasn't enough. They wanted us to give another few thousand dollars. And they were texting with a woman on my team. And she's texting me, we have to say something. We have to do something. And I said, you know what we need to do? Nothing. Like we are going to do nothing today. I'm not making this decision on the back foot when everything is swirling. Let it sleep on it, go exercise, go get a drink, whatever you need to do tonight. We're going to touch this tomorrow morning. And the buyer calmed down and his attorney reached out to us and said, look, we just need to do something. And this is, and it was very concrete. And we were like, that's fine, right? But it, it solved itself. And the bad, and sometimes you just have to not respond to that email. Doing what is today is doing something. Right? Yes. It's like, if you are like, oh my god, freaking out, just put the phone down, put it in another room. Go have dinner. I know it may not be the best, the most fun dinner. But like try to distract yourself with something positive. And I, that's we, we focus on it all the time. Because the solutions come to you. People say, I'll sleep on it and whatever. It's actually a thing. You wake up a little, with a little different perspective. Yes. And maybe you've processed some of that stress while you're sleeping or whatever activity. You know, it's so funny, Scott. I was, I just learned this in 47. I wish I would have learned this much, much earlier in life. But I was doing a meditation class. It was actually taught by LeBron James of all people. And so it was kind of funny. And I was like, okay, I know. I would love to know what LeBron James does is one of the greatest of all time. And he said it's critical for him to be mindful of his emotions. Because in really stressful times on the court, he can't allow himself to get angry or scared or sad. Because it impedes his ability to do his job. And he actually has less access to his, all his resources when he's stressed. And we know that the sympathetic nervous system, the fight or flight response kicks in when we're stressed. And you just, if you do just a cursory dive into what happens biologically, we are limited in our resources. Our brain has limited resources. Our body is literally trying to survive at that moment. So it's not the time to make any sort of really impactful decision, unless you're in a literally life or death situation. That's why those resources are there. So being that that's not probably what's happening. It's not the time to make decisions. And he talked about that in this meditation course. And he's like, I have to be calm on the court. Because if I get upset, I lose. He goes, I actually will perform worse. And this is the number one guy, maybe of all time, saying that are certainly one of them. So I am right on the same page with you. And there are ways to learn how to, you know, man better manage your emotions. Or like Scott says, you know, hey, even if it's just go take a walk, go have dinner, sleep on it, could not agree with you more. That is such a wise test. You know, I'm just thinking, you asked me, how are we being successful this year? And people accuse me of being an optimist. Okay, and I will gladly say like, yes, I'm an optimist. And I think to be a good agent, you have to believe in your clients. You have to believe in being successful for them. Right? But you also, there are so much noise. There's so much negativity in the news. And on social media in places, right? And I would encourage people to take a look at what they're consuming and reading and even the people they're around. You know, there are agents who are doing great. And even if they're having a tougher year, like be around the people that are positive, be around, surround yourself with some positivity, people who have ideas. How are they going to actually move forward? Don't the people who are complaining about what's going on? But they're like, hey, let me try something new to get this sold. Let me try this thing. This is a working, let me try this. Okay, it's not always, it could be just price. You know, but there's always something to do. But I think the bigger picture is maybe stop looking at the news. Right? Maybe of subtract some of the stuff that just leaves you prominently stressed out all the time. There are so many agents who said to me, yeah, you know, there's no inventory in my town. And we talk through it. You're like, okay, well, how do you, if ask a different question? Oh, right. How can I create some inventory? You know, ask it and then maybe you'll have an idea that just comes out of nowhere. Like maybe you want to host a dinner or maybe you want to have people over to your home. And just, you know, talk about the successes you're having. And something might unlock. Something might, you know, if you do, if that results in one more deal this year, wouldn't that be great? As opposed, you know, it's, you know, just sitting there. That is such a great, ask a different question. That is such great advice. So Scott just said, you know, you're, let's say you work with a buyer, there's no inventory. And it's frustrating. Of course, it's frustrating. It's frustrating for the buyer. It's frustrating for the agent. And Scott says, okay, well, let's ask a different question. We can't fix that. That is, you know, what is is that old Zen saying what, or people say, I don't know, they say the different ones. What is, it is what it is. Yeah, yeah. I learned in a different way. What is is what one is the same thing. But what is is? And if you push against reality, you're, you're just going to tire yourself out and you're not going to affect it. But if you pivot and ask a different question, how can I create inventory? Well, that solves a lot of problems, right? And ultimately, that's, that's the job of the agent is to create a problem solving. And I could not agree with you more. Change the questions. Change the, notice how you feel when you're watching an absorbing information, news, social media, whatever. If it makes you feel good, good. If it doesn't make you feel good, be mindful of that and limit, because that is, limit the amount of exposure you have to, is going to influence how you feel. It just does. It's just the way it works. And social media and news media in particular are very skilled at creating a motion, emotional intensity with their viewers, their audience. That's their job. That is how they get paid. So it's not that it's not important information to hear. It's just you have to realize that the way they keep you attuned to their channel or their website is by creating such an emotional intense environment that sort of captivates you. And you have to be careful because that's going to influence how you feel. Indeed. Yeah, so I was just, I was thinking about the one thing that we do, we have a stand up meeting three days a week as a team. And I mean, I meet with the members of the team every other week on one to one, and we talk about their business and how I can help them grow their business and we brainstorm and we come up. But the real important thing that you can start a meeting with is going around the room and talking about what one thing you're grateful for or one thing you're proud of. I learned that from an amazing business coach that I worked with, the guy named John Mark Shaw, who I've been working with for a bunch of years, he based in New York, give a shout out to John Lovehem, he's amazing. And that alone just shifts the whole room. People might be having a bad day or, you know, they woke up, you just don't know what people are showing up with. You know, they may not have slept well because they have a baby and it's, you know, they're up all night or their dog is sick or who knows, right? And like just focusing on one thing you're grateful for, one thing you're proud of can totally change your energy. And then when you get on that phone with the next call, you know, and you had a setback, there's like a pause and all of a sudden, you know, you don't bring that bad with you for the next call, you know. It's so important and I know we're spending a lot of time on this but I really think it is one of the most important skills for agents to learn is how to, you know, set themselves up for success. You know, people call it mindset, you know, whatever you want to call it, just being able to prime yourself so that you're in the best possible place to serve your clients and serve your, your own business as well. So I could not, I could not agree with you more and it's the reason this podcast existed for the exact same reason as I want people to realize agents who are struggling that this path is, is possible and, you know, 500 episodes later, thankfully, people are listening and we appreciate that. And so we're so grateful to people like Scott because, you know, a lot of times too, I think it's easy to sort of forget that top producers still are doing a lot of the same activities that a brand new agent will be doing. They have more experience, they're able to do it at a different scale. But I suspect Scott, I bet a lot of the same things you do today are things you did 20 years ago. And by the way, yes, yes, like I think, you know, if there's some simple thing I do, when I think of someone, I send them a text. When I see something and I'm like, oh, I think of that person, I just do it. I don't, there's no like, make a list and then do it. Like if it takes two seconds, I do it and that's the way I've always been. I mean, I do have ADHD. It's like, oh, I have an idea. Let's do it. But if it's simple, I do it. But I want to say something because if you're out there, you're like, oh, this guy, you know, sold a bunch of real estate and, you know, he's really got to figure it out. I am stressed out. I make mistakes left, right in center, you know, I have plenty of deals that die, that fall apart and I make, you know, I say the wrong thing, I all the time and I call myself out in front of the team as much as I can because they need to know that it continues, you know, you have a bad day. You think, oh, I'm not good enough to get this piece, this listing and you talk yourself into some, all of those things, the self-talk, the negative self-talk, it just continues. You have to really be aware of it and work through it. Yes. The same things that, you know, that you might struggle with if you're a newer agent, everyone does it and everyone continues to make mistakes. And it's like, the more you just own it and the team appreciates when I talk about my mistakes, oh, I screwed this up. Sure. Oh, my God, I screwed this up. We launched a listing with the wrong price recently. I was like, oh, God, like, I can't believe I did that. Just stuff that you, you have to call yourself out because it makes people feel like they can be successful and they don't have to be perfect. You know, and that's such a relief. Such a relief. Like, you're a human, you make mistakes, I get it, I do it too, right? And that's the team is held to account, but not held to perfection. Yeah, I actually think successful people fail more than non-successful people. I really do because I think once, when I say fail, I mean, making a mistake and error, you know, whatever that looks like, because it's the only way we actually learn, we learn via mistake. You know, when we do something that we already know how to do, that just sort of, you know, just validates what we already know. We don't, it's not much of a learning opportunity, but when we make a mistake, that's where wisdom comes in and that's where Scott has 20 years of making mistakes. Which, and again, I say that in the most respectful way possible, I mean, Scott, if we look at his track record and his team's track record, you know, billion dollars sold, these guys know what they're doing and they make lots of mistakes along the way, but they keep going and they keep learning. And that's the thing is I almost think, if you can learn to get excited about making mistakes, then you'll be in a little bit of a better position because they won't be so devastating when they happen. You know, I make, but we have 800 agents here. I make mistakes every single day. Terrible mistakes. Terrible mistakes. And yet, and yet, yet here we are. And, you know, our brokerage continues to grow, Scott's as well. So, you know, it's not about not making mistakes, as Scott said, you know, nobody's perfect. But realizing that the mistake is actually the opportunity to then, you know, correct something for the future. So it's actually get excited about your errors, your mistakes, listeners, because that's where the real growth happens. Yeah, there's lots to learn. I mean, whenever we have a deal die, or like we lose a bidding war, or whatever you can want to consider, you can either consider it like this is the fail, right? Something that happened, you're like, wait a minute, like what did I learn through that? You know, we have, I mean, and there's so much out of your control anyway, you lose a pitch. Okay, what was there to be learned there? You know, if you bat 50% on your pitches, you're doing incredibly well. We're going, you know, it's, you're going to win some, sometimes somebody has a relationship with the cousin, and they're going to win the listing, no matter how, they're like, we love you. But if I hire you, my wife's going to divorce me, like that's just the way it goes, you know, and you're like, okay, I get it. And is that a fail? No, it's like you just, you chalk it up. And maybe there's going to be an opportunity where they refer you to someone else. You know, yeah, there, there's, there's always other opportunities, because of course, with real estate, everyone's got to live somewhere, right? So this idea of, you know, there isn't a finite pie really in this, in this business, there's so much opportunity. But you do have to sort of, you know, have the correct questions that you might be asking yourself or questions that will lead you into opportunity. And that's really what Scott's talking about is being super mindful of your thoughts, you know, what's coming in, what you're saying to yourself, how you're treating yourself. And then of course, you know, how you're, you know, interacting with clients as well. Scott, let's talk about client winning business, because I think, you know, at your level, you know, you're dealing with certainly, you know, you're working in the most, arguably the most difficult market in the country. And there's lots of competition, lots of great agents in New York City, you being one of them. But there being lots of other really fantastic agents. I've had a lot of them, even from Brown Hairsteevans on my show. So I know how the competition is out there. How do you think about competition? And when you're maybe up against, I assume it happens in listing presentations, maybe you're up against other agents, maybe even agents you know. How do you sort of approach that? Because I know that that can be very stressful for agents. Well, first, of course, you're going up against other agents in a lot of situations. That's just, I mean, if I were looking to buy a car, I'm looking at multiple cars, right? I mean, yes. You're trying different things. So I think any good seller is going to do a little bit of due diligence. I think that's actually great. I have a couple of answers to this. One, and some people are going to, I don't know how they're going to react, but I actually don't think of everyone as competition. I mean, during COVID, I was putting out video after video to the entire brokerage community, about how technology we could use to go and because we were totally shut down for a few months there. And I was like, oh, you can use this video service to do shoots. And you can do this. And let's try this because it's like, I believe that a rising tide lifts all boats. You know, the better, the more professional we are as a community, the more successful everyone is. Okay, so I think of, I want to establish the best relationships across the brokerage community. Because we, 20% of the agents do 80% of the business. That's just the nature of things. So I just want to be great at what I do, knowing that it's going to help me somehow. And I want to help them do a good job. So I don't always think about everyone as competition. Sure. If you flip it and say, okay, I know I'm, I'm, they're meeting multiple people, right? It's like, what is, how do I really articulate what makes us different and special? And I'm like, okay, first we have a track record. I'm not trying to pat myself on the back. But if I don't say something, nobody else will, right? Right. 20 years of experience, lots of sales, and we have a great system to get this soul for you. But more than that, we care about you. And I've been referred, I can't tell you how many times I've been referred to people. Scott, we referred you because you're not a jerk. Right? And I mean, I know that's, may sound like simple, but I actually care about the people. I want to see them be successful. And that underpins everything. So the system is to create win-win. It's like, I'm not, if you're looking for somebody to rip off, you know, rip off somebody's face, that's like a phrase, you know, like, really take advantage and like, you know, kill someone and get the best deal ever. That's not my approach. Do I, am I a good negotiator? Yes. Can I get great deals? Can I uncover great deals? Absolutely. But the approach is, how can I make this into a win-win situation? Because if you don't, they're going to find a way to get you later. I really think like big picture, if you can try, your intention is to create a win-win situation for us, a really happy buyer, and a happy seller. That's my assumption. How do I do that? Right? How can I say that? And it's the intention, which we'll get you further. And we're going to be super resourceful. We're going to be incredibly creative. In our marketing, we're branding your property. If we're representing a seller, you know, with a buyer, we're selling, we're selling the buyer as, you know, we've had people that we, there was no way they were getting someone who had a dog in a building that doesn't allow dogs. Okay? Pretty open and shut case, right? And we got them approved to buy and bring their little dog Benson into that property. Because we found the way around it. You know, can they go into the service, I mean, it was, they went to the service elevator and the dog couldn't go out, the regular entrance and whatever. It got a little crazy. But like, it's just how can we care enough to really find answers when other people say they can't be done? And that has served us really well, right? And the trackway could approve it. But if you, if you are new and you're just like, I really care, and I'm going to go learn, I'm going to study this inventory, like nobody's business, and I'm going to go, I'm going to know every building there is or I'm going to know all the comps that sold. I'm going to study the heck out of this. And when things close, I'm going to, you know, communicate that to people like, hey, look at this closing on your block. And you know, you're going to set up searches so that you just know more. You're already way ahead. Way ahead. Way ahead. What you just gave, you basically gave a pretty amazing, it might sound non-specific, but it's not, not specific. It is entirely specific. You just gave a great plan for anyone who is, you know, learn your inventory, you know, understand the market, you know, increase your skill set, your knowledge, and stay in touch with people. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, it's, and most importantly, care about them. You know, that's, that's the missing piece. I always think, I think caring wins the game most of the time. You know, there's going to be times where it's just a strictly a number situation. Yeah, those are, yeah, happens, I guess. But the vast majority of human beings who are going to employ you to buy or sell a home really want, you, they want to feel that you, that you care about them. And you can demonstrate that and you can demonstrate that over and over again, empathy, sympathy, checking in on that, making sure they know that you know what's going on in their lives, that you know what their goals are. And I know that's really important for you is you get really excited. And if you're not watching this live once, if you're not watching this visually, you're listening, Scott got really, really animated earlier when he was talking about, you know, working with his clients dreams. He got really, really excited because, because, and imagine, if you have a real estate agent, if you're not in this business and you need a real estate agent to buy or sell something, you wouldn't you want somebody who is really excited and at your dreams, right? So that's demonstrating care. And, and I think that, you know, Scott, that's just, it just oozes out of you. It also, if it's about caring, then it's, you're, people so often forget they're like on the, on the same side of the table, they sort of, they just forget that they're working with someone. You know, that they're, they're not working against someone. Everybody, you're helping someone, they so desperately want to sell this thing. They have an idea of what they want to do and it's about them, right? It just make it about them. Like, you go to a cocktail party and get super nervous because you're like, oh, I, you know, I don't know anybody and whatever. And the second you just get curious about the person you're talking to, all that melts away. It's like, you can't be fear, you can't be afraid and curious at the same time, right? Like, I've heard that before. I think it's very, yeah, that's true. Like, I want to learn about you. What are you about? And, and when you care, there's so much more forgiveness for little mistakes. You know, I care. I'm going to figure it out. We're going to brand this property. We're going to just, whatever we do. And it's, now and then it goes perfectly, right? You know, people, you know, like, okay, we had this deal. We had an exact, you know, strategy. We priced it here. We got a deal done. Blah, blah, blah. Vity war. It was amazing. And then a lot of the times, especially in markets like this, it takes a little bit longer. A lot of you got very used to in 19, in 2021, to like, things selling, over asking in one day. Good. Well, that was fun for a minute. You know, I was in Vegas last year and these LA, this Los Angeles agents were like, oh my god, it's like, I've got to hire more people. Like, I'm not sleeping my white, you know, it's crazy. My life is a jambals because it was, they were just so much business. But now it just comes down. There's never been a more important time to have a good system to manage this and to manage the people and all the potential, you know, the pitfalls of a market where mortgage rates are slightly higher than they were, you know, year and a half ago. Yes, slightly higher. And that can, and that could be a place where people get trapped. Agents can get in that mindset of high interest rates, low inventory, not as much opportunity. Well, okay. Yes, maybe. And let's shift our focus and start thinking about how do we demonstrate? One thing we can do is we can demonstrate care. I could reach out to every single person in my database over the next several months. Let them know I'm thinking about them to check in and see what's going on in their lives. You know, see what they're doing on social media and comment on it. And say, hey, I saw you just got back from a vacation. It looked awesome, you know, really excited for you or whatever. There's lots of ways you can demonstrate this. And, you know, if I was somebody without a listing today, without any listings today, what I might do is reach out to everybody I know and print out the zest of it from Zillow and say, hey, Zillow, things are homeless worth this. I actually think it might be slightly different, but I just wanted to share this with you. It'd give me a call and we can chat about it, right? That's an opportunity. People, there's always reasons to pick up the phone and call somebody and connect with them. And that's what this business is. It's really, it really is a service business. I mean, it's more service than it is anything. And like you said, we're on the same side of the table as the client. Like, how do we, how do we always keep that perspective, right? Well, I wanted, you were touching on, you know, something you can do. I don't think I mentioned yet. In New York, we have buildings. So somebody buys an apartment in a building. It's not hard for us to set up a search so that every time price comes available in that building, you can, it's information you can share with your client, right? And it's like, oh, you know, it's some of my high inclines. We've sold, you know, multi-million dollar properties in the building. It's very exciting when you see something that's selling at a higher price. But at the same, I've had a situation downtown last year where I'd sold an apartment to, to a client. And the same apartment came available at what I thought was an excellent price. And I said, I emailed my friend. I said, oh, this is such a, it's so interesting. I can't wait to see what this sells for. He immediately introduced me to his friend who wanted to buy that unit. I negotiated it without ever, I hadn't meet the client until about two months later. And we had, we put a deal together just because I was sharing that information with no expectation. I was like, oh, this will be neat just because I wanted him to know about it. But the other piece which I know I haven't talked about is the idea of telling stories, right? So if you have, even if one of the great things about having a team is that this team and some of the agents are new, they get to hear every single, we've sold maybe, I think, 80 apartments this year, 80 deals in New York. That can be a pretty big volume. Some people sell 300, 400 homes and God bless you for being able to do that. That's incredible. But every, the every agent on the team can own those stories as their own. And every, every of the week, we take an hour and we talk about like three different case studies of like, what did you do right that success? And then every other week we do, whatever the challenges you overcame. But the idea is that you evolve. What are these stories of things that are happening today? Because people love to hear about wins. And it's like, you're not bragging. You're just like, oh, we just help this client, you know, put a dog in there in a non, in a building where no dogs are allowed. That was so exciting. Or we help someone get a great deal on this building. That sale was a million dollars less than the last one that traded. That's like, I want to hear that. Tell me more about that Scott. So those are, if you have good stories, share the stories. Not people, what's the question in cocktail parties in New York? How's the market? Well, well, actually, the prices are up 4%. No, like, tell a story. Just tell the story about something. Well, we were helping this buyer. And, you know, they're excited about this neighborhood. You know, we got, we got a deal done here. We were having a lot of success in this neighborhood. You know, why do you ask? What's, you know, what are you thinking about? Like, there's so many ways you can answer without the boring market data information. You know, that is a really great, great tip. Definitely have stories to share that are authentic to you that are impactful to you and that you have passion about so that when you do get asked those questions, because that is the first question that anyone asks when, you know, when somebody says, oh, I've been real estate. Oh, how's the market, right? That you're absolutely right. The number most commonly asked question. And you can answer that with whatever facts and figures you have. But Scott is absolutely right. Have some personal examples of things that you are currently working on or have done. And this is a great, I think, you know, Scott, you said something also very powerful. Like, after every deal you guys go through and say, okay, what, what, well, what, what were there, where were their challenges or opportunities for growth or, or, you know, was there a story here that we can, we can work with, you know, just basically working through the transaction after it's done and finding those, those magic moments and maybe the challenging moments and then learning from the challenging moments and then really celebrating the magic moments. I mean, it's great for marketing. It's great for keeping the team spirit up and also just, you know, continuing to service the client. I love that. Thanks. It's fun. It's fun to do that. It's much more interesting than we just did a webinar with an economist and, you know, a mortgage broker and this wonderful data. And it was, we were talking about the market, but like, what really came to life is the stories. What are we seeing in the market? The actual deals. That's where people can wrap their heads around it. Yeah, I could not, I could not agree with you more. I 100% a big fan of learn how to tell stories. I actually, it was funny. You just reminded me of a interview I had once with an agent in Florida who sells mega, mega properties like 30 million plus kind of, you know, it's just a different sort of whole thing. And he, you know, because when he sells those types of properties, of course, there's a whole teams that are involved that you have to work with and there's a lot more people involved in the transaction, a lot more complication usually. However, he said it was really funny. He goes, well, it's all about storytelling, meaning it's all about, you know, he goes, when I show a perspective buyer this property, I want to know what their vision is for the property. And I want to tell them the story of this property and really sell them on it. And that he goes, that's really all I do. He goes, I tell the story. And I, unite stories basically, which I thought was really a smart idea. Scott, one other thing too, so we talked about providing value. I'm curious, what are you doing to celebrate your clients after a transaction? How do you stay in touch with people after? You know, that's, it's, it's, it's a great question. And I think a lot of people don't think and you know, we, we, it's, there's no one size fits all gift. Although a gift is nice. You know, it's, it's, it's an acknowledgement of a milestone, something happened here. That was important enough that we wanted to say thank you for entrusting us for like the biggest transaction probably in your life. Now in New York, that's not always true. You know, people are, you know, doing multi-billion dollar deals in their jobs and this is like a place to live for them and it happens to be five million dollars. It doesn't matter. You know, those people, I always, you know, that I'm going to botch the quote from that movie Notting Hill, but at some point, you're just a girl standing in front of a boy, hoping that, you know, he's going to love her, right? Yeah, yeah, ask your to like her or whatever. And that's really, it doesn't matter what the price is. This is a sacred moment for people. And so what's the gift? What's the gift? What is going to touch someone? Maybe it's a donation to a charity that you know they support. That's easy to find. And people don't, we do that. Somebody is a runner and they want, we want to support the Central Park Conservancy on their behalf. Okay. Sometimes it's, it's just some beautiful roses, you know, it's something simple like that. It's, it's certainly not always alcohol, not everybody drinks, right? Of bottle of champagne. Sure. It's pretty, it's pretty boring sometimes. Sometimes it's, it depends on the person. So like take the moment to, to, to, to master, to mastermind with your team. What do we think them the best thing for them is take them out to lunch or take them out to dinner, do something to acknowledge this in banks. They have these celebratory closing dinners. You know, it, it, connect on a personal level. I know it's sometimes a little bit weird. Hey, can we get together after the closing? But do it. Find a way to connect with people. But we also celebrate every, every, once a week, we have a meeting as a team and we go through what are our celebrations. And I think that people, especially, you know, type A, I can speak for myself. The closing happens and you're like, you don't even, even take five seconds to celebrate it for yourself. Think about what you can do. The people that you help. So celebrate for yourself, celebrate with your team, celebrate with your clients. Give them the, the room to be happy about what it is. Because it's like they've just achieved something big. Maybe this is like their, their lifelong dream, right? There's a reason they call it a dream house. Take a second to, to really let that soak in. Yeah. And also every year on the anniversary, you can relive that, that moment. And you can remind them of that moment. And you can reach out and, and check in and say, Hey, it's a year, you know, a year to the day that you bought that property. How's it working for you? I just wanted to check in and see how it's going. If you're having any problems with anything, I let me know. I can help you get it stuff. Thanks, Neville. But just excited. It's been a whole year, you know, and that sort of excitement and passion that I'm sort of speaking for Scott Scott, obviously speaks for himself. But you can hear the passion in Scott's voice. So I just love this, this conversation because I think what we're really talking about is, is yeah, just being into your clients, get into your clients, like be into them, you know, be into what they're into, you know, get excited about what they're excited about, help support their stuff and their vision, their dreams. And boy, they're going to be with you for life. I mean, that's all we really want. I wanted to, something I learned a few years ago, I just never thought about it this way. We all get referrals, right? And we say thank you when they come in. And, you know, if we, if there's a referral from another agent, it's like my favorite thing to do is to write that it's very easy to celebrate because you're writing a big check to someone who referred you this client. Thank you so much. It's amazing, you know, and for those brokers out in the, in the rest of the country, it's like our favorite thing to do. We send so much business. It's like we've done 15 deals in Pittsburgh this year for some reason. We've, you know, referred that much out and Florida and Connecticut and all over the place. But, but if someone thinks enough of you to refer you, I keep them and I keep them in touch. And then, you know, what is that thank you that happens at the end of the transaction to them? Sometimes it's, it's, I don't want to put a dollar number on it, but is there something special you can do say a let a handwritten letter? But the little nuance, which I loved was like, okay, this deal came from here. And what was the, what was the parent of that referral and what was the grandparent? And can you go back how far and say, you know, I, I did a rental deal in 2003 and that turned into 40 or 50 million dollars of business over time. And I go back and say, you know, I wish I want to say thank you for trusting as this new agent who co-incalled you when the classified ads were still a thing in the New York Times because that I just closed another deal because of our relationship from 20 years ago. And I just wanted to say thank you and it's like, so I'm so full of gratitude because I can really trace it back. And if you take a moment for that, like I, I'm feeling so grateful right now, just little bit like John, this artist who hired me years and years ago, I had no experience. I had no business, you know, almost no business doing that deal, but it turned into so much more. And you can go in every direction and think about all of the different ways that you have gotten to where you've gotten and just stand there for a second and say, who should I be thank? Who should I thank right now? Yeah. And boy, I was feeling grateful for the for the gentleman back in 2003 who took a chance on you as well because obviously it's it's birthed this amazing career that you are now in. And that is it is such a great suggestion. Let's appreciate the people in our lives and let them know how appreciative we are because we are to them. That is really the key. It's got you, it's funny. We're this is a bit of a different kind of episode that we normally do. We're talking a little bit more about emotional stuff. And but I think this is really what wins the game. And so you know, care about people tell them how much they mean to you. You know, we know how much homes mean to people. So we want to we want to continue on with this, you know, increase intimacy, I think is is the key to this business. And that's through a lot of effort and caring consideration. Scott, I think it's a great place for us to wrap up. I want to mention for anyone listening who is an agent in in Manhattan, also Brooklyn, Scott's team covers both both Manhattan and Brooklyn. If you are looking to maybe see what other options exist this year, maybe you're not getting the attention you deserve or just want to see, you know, what other teams are offering reach out to Scott and may or may not be a good fit. But he would love the opportunity to say hello and see if maybe you could be a good addition to the team. Also, if you are an agent elsewhere in the country and you have clients that come to and from New York City, we of course know New York City can be a very transient place. People can go there and then leave. Well, of course, Scott needs people to refer to as well. And he would love to hear me your referrals as well. So reach out to Scott. The best way to reach him is to visit him on his website, which is Harris residential.com. And then you can also find him on linked in Scott Harris. Let's definitely follow him. He posts almost daily on linked in with really great content there. So let's let's follow. He's kind of really impressive following there. But on behalf of our audience, Scott, I want to thank you for your time today. You were amazing guest. This is the exact kind of conversations I love having. And you really provided a lot of value. So thank you on behalf of the audience. On behalf of Scott and myself, we want to thank the audience as well. Thank you for sticking around to the end of the episode. Thank you for supporting our show. The best way you can help us is by telling a friend, think of one other agent that is maybe struggling this year and maybe just needs a little boost.
