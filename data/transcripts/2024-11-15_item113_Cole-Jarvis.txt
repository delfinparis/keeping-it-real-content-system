[00:01:21] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team?
[00:01:25] Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:29] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:32] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:34] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:38] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking

[00:02:20] needs and what my brokerage can offer.

[00:02:59] agents.
[00:03:00] And for real estate agents, my name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:02] I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:05] And just a moment, we're going to be speaking with Cole Jarvis, a social media strategist.
[00:03:09] I'm very excited to talk with Cole.
[00:03:11] Before we get to Cole, just a couple of quick reminders.

[00:03:55] All right, now let's get right to it.
[00:03:56] My conversation with Cole Jarvis.
[00:04:12] Today, my guest on the show is Cole Jarvis with Jarvis Media.
[00:04:17] Let me tell you more about Cole with experience working at Facebook, TikTok, I Heart Media,
[00:04:23] and Coldwell Banker.
[00:04:24] Cole has developed social media strategies that help real estate agents of all sizes see
[00:04:29] massive brand growth using internal knowledge of how social media platforms operate.
[00:04:34] Cole knows what works, what doesn't work, and what actually makes a difference for the
[00:04:39] bottom line of a real estate agent.
[00:04:41] Leveraging smart content creation and combining it with robust paid advertising, Cole has
[00:04:46] generated, check this out, almost 500,000 followers, 488,000 followers to be exact, and
[00:04:53] reach over 39 million prospects for his agents, which are his clients, saving them almost
[00:05:00] $1 million a year for, sorry, saving them almost $1 million for the cost of hiring an
[00:05:06] internal social media manager.
[00:05:09] So he's basically showing agents how to do this without having to hire somebody as a manager
[00:05:15] and he gets unbelievable results.
[00:05:18] I want everybody to check out Jarvis Media at Jarvismediaco.com, J-A-R-V-I-S, mediaco.co.
[00:05:27] We will have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:05:30] Cole, welcome to the show.
[00:05:32] Thanks, TJ.
[00:05:33] I really appreciate it.
[00:05:34] I am really excited to chat with you because there's always more that I could learn about
[00:05:40] effective social media strategy and also, you know, it's such a changing environment.
[00:05:48] You know, there's always updates.
[00:05:49] There's always things that used to work that don't work anymore.
[00:05:52] So I'm excited to kind of dive in and get the state of social media marketing these days.
[00:05:57] I think a lot of agents, you know, have for years have been told you need to post more.
[00:06:03] You need to post, you know, more frequently.
[00:06:06] You need to do more video.
[00:06:07] You need to, you know, ultimately really, you know, create this, this, this presence and
[00:06:13] this consistent presence.
[00:06:15] But there's not always an easy sort of, you know, guide, a series of guide posts along the way.
[00:06:22] You just sort of sort of have to figure out what that is.
[00:06:25] So I'm excited to kind of dive into some of that today with you.
[00:06:28] But let's get started with your background.
[00:06:30] Tell us like, how did you get into social media?
[00:06:33] Yeah, funny enough, I got into social media via radio in a weird way.
[00:06:40] It's kind of funny.
[00:06:42] But yeah, I'm pretty much out of school.
[00:06:44] I was working at I Heart Media in upstate New York where I'm from.
[00:06:50] And I was like a promotions assistant.
[00:06:52] We'd go to the concerts and all these different like shows and stuff like that.
[00:06:55] And we would help the digital content director, you know, get a bunch of content and help him do his strategy
[00:07:01] for all of the social media stuff that I didn't understand at the time.
[00:07:04] Shortly after he left and in the in the four months or so, it took them to replace them.
[00:07:11] I just decided, hey, I'm just going to take on these responsibilities and just kind of get a little,
[00:07:16] get a little buffer and job security here.
[00:07:20] And by the time they came around to hire, I was like, well, I'm kind of already doing this.
[00:07:23] Let me go ahead and go for it, even though I felt underqualified at the time.
[00:07:27] And got the position.
[00:07:29] And I was pretty instantly thrown into this world that I didn't understand.
[00:07:33] So huge learning curve.
[00:07:35] Didn't really know anything about algorithms about making content SEO.
[00:07:40] New nothing about Photoshop and Premiere, which I grew up in the content world right just right before Canva.
[00:07:47] And all these amazing tools that would have made my life so much easier.
[00:07:52] But, but you know, you kind of you figured out as you go and learn that process.
[00:07:57] It really just fell in love with social media.
[00:07:59] I went out to LA just something I'd always wanted to do lived with the buddy of mine out there.
[00:08:04] I was kind of looking for whatever job I could find and sure enough this company that I had no idea what it was at the time.
[00:08:09] TikTok was hiring.
[00:08:11] That became a really interesting play.
[00:08:14] I knew they were involved in social media, but I didn't know nearly how big of a player they'd become.
[00:08:19] So that was awesome.
[00:08:20] Spent some time at Cold War Banker, which I'm sure we'll talk about.
[00:08:23] And then ultimately the experience at TikTok gave me a couple years at Facebook.
[00:08:27] And then ever since then I've been kind of doing this on my own and it's been kind of a wild trajectory, honestly.
[00:08:34] It's really impressive that you have worked at corporate for some of these firms and really get to see at least to some degree how the donuts are made or at least what the thought process is about how the donuts are made.
[00:08:50] And what are the sort of ways in which they organize information and what are these platforms looking for from content creators.
[00:08:59] So let's dive into REALTORS using social media.
[00:09:04] So I guess the first thing that I'd like to ask you is what do REALTORS get wrong about social media?
[00:09:13] Yeah, oh, that's a great question.
[00:09:15] So in my from what I've seen with the obviously he's talked with a lot of agents all day long.
[00:09:21] Really, I think the thing that people get wrong, honestly, the biggest one and it's the biggest hindrance is just that they think it needs to be perfect.
[00:09:30] Your social media strategy is not so much catching lightning in a bottle as it is a constant process of trial and error.
[00:09:40] But also just kind of you know, putting like putting a grain of sand in the bottle as time goes on, sure there's a better analogy.
[00:09:48] But as you know, you really want to build this so that eventually you have so much content, so much goodwill, especially if it's targeting your your audience well in your market that you built up this goodwill you built up this helpful content that's helped people in their social media or sorry in their real estate journey whether they're buying or selling.
[00:10:08] And then when they already to buy or sell they say, hey, well, you know, John's his content's been helping me all along the way.
[00:10:14] Why wouldn't I work with him to buy or sell my home?
[00:10:17] And that's that's really the simplest approach is that, you know, we can take out and I'm sure we'll talk in detail about all the crazy algorithm stuff and all these little things which can be very helpful.
[00:10:26] But the meat and potatoes of it is you just want to make stuff that helps people and that puts you in a good light to set you up to be their real estate agent.
[00:10:34] That's really the end of all be all of it.
[00:10:36] Yeah, and in social media really gives us an opportunity to dial that message in because we're people's attention spans are are so shortened that we have mere seconds.
[00:10:49] So I know that agents can think, okay, well, then my video does need to be perfect because everything I see on Instagram looks perfect and all the filter, you know, there's filters and production value.
[00:11:00] And I will I'm not going to answer for coal, but I will I will encourage everyone to challenge that that that is the most effective strategy.
[00:11:11] As Cole said, the most effective strategy is giving people items of value things that actually will work for them because and then the actual production level of the, you know, whether it's a video or whatever is a little becomes less important.
[00:11:25] It's certainly is still important, but it is that accurate call that that the content sort of trumps the aesthetic.
[00:11:33] Yeah, what 100% it was so funny. I a lot of times I've worked a lot of video production companies in the past with kind of separate.
[00:11:43] You know, we've helped companies outside of just real estate agents, but we primarily help agents and usually we're just kind of working with them one on one.
[00:11:51] But we've worked with a lot of video production partners in different cases and it's so funny. A lot of these folks who have the best equipment, the best sound, the best lighting.
[00:11:59] Just talking on I think it was on Friday with a couple of folks who run a company out in a video production company out in Austin and they're saying, yeah, we'll purposefully make content lower quality.
[00:12:10] Because it resonates in a different way. And my hypothesis is not so much that the lower quality helps.
[00:12:19] It's actually more so just that the content is so much more important when people see it's something that looks like was filmed on an iPhone, even if it wasn't or even if it's still a professional company doing it.
[00:12:32] They feel like this is really user generated content. They feel like it's more real. Whereas the more produced content gets sometimes the more you risk it coming off like a commercial, which is the antithesis of what people want on social media platforms.
[00:12:46] Right. People want to. So that's it. That's something that we should really think about discussing right now is you just brought up a really great question.
[00:12:55] Do we want to have commercials on Facebook, Instagram, etc. Which outline how our benefits and features and why we're so amazing.
[00:13:08] And this isn't a yes, no question. I although I guess it could be. So do we want to do that and or do we also want to produce
[00:13:19] use what you would call more impromptu content content that isn't as highly produced isn't as slick isn't as scripted but more authentic and and really solve some sort of problem or answers a question that a client might have as I sort of understanding that correctly.
[00:13:36] Yeah, it's so there's it's so interesting. There's a lot of schools of thought when it comes to this.
[00:13:41] And ultimately, I would say like that the the real answer to anything in marketing, whether it's social media or otherwise is testing.
[00:13:49] So the real way is to test it. But the different schools of thought are very interesting. You have the Gary V model, which is the jab jab jab right hook.
[00:13:56] The idea there is you have three great pieces of content that are value driven for every one content that's like, hey, by the way, here's what I do. You can work with me.
[00:14:06] That's a strategy that's kind of actually more has become famous really from the TV model. You look at how much time you would spend watching the show versus how many times, you know, in a cable show you get commercials.
[00:14:18] That's like pretty close to the ratio. If not like, you know, for the four to one, maybe more more accurate. There's also more of like a slightly more nuanced kind of influence or like model that I think.
[00:14:32] A lot of people have popularized, but Alex Hermosi is one of the folks who've done this really well, which is simply like, you know, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give forever.
[00:14:42] And then ultimately you will receive because you will deposit so much good will that people will want to work with you both have proven to be super successful.
[00:14:50] And so you can implement more ad like content as long as the ratio to value is a lot higher.
[00:14:59] Ultimately, the best approaches to test that. But I actually believe also because real estate specifically is such a competitive space.
[00:15:08] And sometimes people don't realize it, but I'll tell folks that I'm talking with them. I'm like, listen, you're in your market. You're one of a thousand real estate agents all selling the exact same thing for the exact same price.
[00:15:20] Like that is a competitive market by definition. There are a few industries that are that competitive.
[00:15:25] And so I think the more you can be a unicorn, the better.
[00:15:29] And also I think it actually lends itself to be more conducive to the schedule of the average agent to just make content more authentically.
[00:15:38] Just do it with your smartphone. You don't need the fancy stuff and just try and answer the question.
[00:15:42] You know, what do I think people are struggling with in my market and real estate?
[00:15:46] You know, what are questions I'm commonly asked, which lends itself more towards the kind of the last thing you would mention the more authentic.
[00:15:52] Let me just try to solve a problem with content and maybe not make a huge commercial.
[00:15:56] A lot of different ways to approach it. But I think that last one is the best starting point because it means you don't have to, you know, spend a ton of time doing all of this preparation for like a fancy commercial to produce.
[00:16:09] Yeah, that absolutely makes sense. It's sort of the consumption model of marketing where we just want people consuming our content.
[00:16:18] So maybe real estate agents should think about, okay, if I want to find clients via social media, if I want to have people reach out to me, of course, the answer is yes, you likely do.
[00:16:31] So if that's true, then what we have to do is think of social media as as a stage to which we are now performing for the audience and what, you know, what, what does that audience want?
[00:16:45] What does that audience need? What do in what way do they want to receive this? Do they want to see pictures? Do they want to see video?
[00:16:51] And again, testing, there isn't, you know, answers really, the dry answers to all of this. There are, of course, themes and, you know, certainly directions of ways in which technology is heading and consumption changes.
[00:17:07] But it seems to be that what we really want is just good quality content. How, so you said, you know, make a list of questions your clients ask you essentially that that is one way.
[00:17:22] What do you think about the, hey, I just sold this house or I just listed this house, those kind of posts? What are, what are your sort of take on those?
[00:17:29] Yeah, so it's so funny because I think that the mentality behind posting, hey, just sold, just listed those classic posts that, you know, we see a lot of if you're an agent is especially if you're looking at other agents content.
[00:17:43] And the mentality is like, well, I just did some great work. I got this great review. I want to showcase it. And innately that, that makes sense, right?
[00:17:52] The problem is that it lends itself more to how social media maybe 1.0 was versus kind of the social media 2.0 world that we're in.
[00:18:02] Not that those are, I'm sure people have a better like, you know, phrase, theology for like the different eras of social media.
[00:18:08] But the way I think about it and this was, by the way, I can mark exactly when this happened because I was working at I heart and that first job when this shifted and it was a big,
[00:18:17] really hurtful shift, but essentially it used to be more like social media was almost like building an email list, you'd accumulate an audience and then once you had that audience, then you could distribute content and like for the most part, pretty much everyone would be distributed your content, right?
[00:18:34] Maybe a little bit less some days or other, but generally it was accumulative list and then service that list with your content.
[00:18:40] that has very much so shifted. And so now, regardless of the amount of followers you have good or bad, your content is much more of a meritocracy now.
[00:18:50] You have to earn every view now. And in some ways, that's great. If you were barriers to entry, some ways that's really hard. More effort, more time needed to get some great content.
[00:18:59] And so ultimately, when we create more content that's like, hey, here's all this good work I did. The reason that lends itself to the old model is because well, people would get your content either way.
[00:19:12] Now, because you have to earn every view, that is really hard to compete that piece of content against somebody's viral cat video.
[00:19:19] Or even what most people go on social media for, which is their friends or family, and trying to avoid business content, which is no hard for businesses to really grow organically purely from their content.
[00:19:31] And so I would say that it's better to lean away from that and maybe strategically sprinkle that in instead.
[00:19:39] So, hey, I just sold this house for my, these folks in this market and you name your market there because it's helpful for SEO and just for relevancy for your audience.
[00:19:49] Here's what they struggled with. Here's what we helped them with and kind of make it more and more of a narrative. It takes a little bit more effort than just posting a graphic, but ultimately, that's going to get more viewers for sure.
[00:19:59] You know, you brought up a really good point. It's like, what does the audience want? Do audiences really want commercials? Well, the answer isn't no. We certainly accept a certain level of commercial in our life.
[00:20:13] We see billboards, we watch television, you know, streaming services that can have ads as well. So it's not that we don't, I mean, I don't personally love commercials.
[00:20:23] I think most people don't love watching a commercial, but we tolerate it. But I think you're right. So I would tolerate somebody's just listing just sold in it and it's nice to see your friends succeed and all of that is great.
[00:20:35] But if I'm somebody who I'm looking for maybe new new, you know, new players into my new new leads, I am not, you know, that's probably not going to do the trick.
[00:20:49] I think if we're looking for for new clients, the way to do it is is to think about what are what are those clients searching for online? What problems are they trying to solve?
[00:21:03] Yeah, and I think that's important to I think the biggest difficulty I think most folks have with like a let's say a purely organic strategy is just that one, it takes a lot of effort into it takes a lot of time.
[00:21:16] And that's that's tough, especially for most agents who are like, well, I need a listing next month, otherwise I'm starting to get worried about, you know, my how far will my previous commission get me.
[00:21:26] And so and that's where it's really tough and where it does start to make sense kind of figuring out, of course, you know, where is your effort, where are your efforts best allocated.
[00:21:36] Now what's nice about, you know, cold marketing is that, you know, you can always do more.
[00:21:43] And what I always say is the way to really think about like viewership for instance, like let's say you get a hundred views.
[00:21:48] Most people would be depressed that they got a hundred views on a social media post.
[00:21:52] But the way to really think about this, especially if you're making content that you know is targeting the right audience, imagine that you had a small amphitheater of a hundred people and you could just address them basically whenever you wanted.
[00:22:04] Pretty much at will that would feel quite powerful. However, on social media, it doesn't feel nearly as powerful because of the fact that we see people with billions and millions of trillions of views, you know, flying all over the place and it feels like everyone's gotten amazing following besides us.
[00:22:19] So I think that's the important thing is we do need to separate the mindset, especially between like the influencer who is making content purely just to make content and that's the whole business strategy versus an agent who is trying to make content to help more people in their real estate business.
[00:22:38] And the amount of viewers is not nearly as important as the quality of the viewers. That's always something that is is a big tough point for people, I think to realize.
[00:22:49] But I think when you do it, it makes you feel better, makes you feel more encouraged to make more content. And also it's just it's a better way to think about it because you shouldn't compare yourself to the Logan Paul's who are making a viral content or Mr. Beast, for instance, who are kind of going off on on these crazy content creation experiences.
[00:23:08] So let's talk a little bit about branding because ultimately what we're really trying to do is evolve or serve our brand. So every agent is their own brand. I would argue, but how should someone start to create and I if they don't have a well defined brand, what should they do first?
[00:23:29] Yeah, great question. So what I always recommend and this actually kind of solves two problems in one. So we want to create a brand, we need to know, okay, what what is a brand? A brand is really just an association, right? It's saying, hey, this person represents these values. And that's why I like them or I dislike them, whatever it may be.
[00:23:48] And so when we're creating a brand, we know that we need to have a repetition of content, as we were talking about on social media here, that enforces that brand that represents whatever those brand, those content pillars are.
[00:24:03] So let's say you're a real estate agent and you're like, hey, I really want to be a no pressure real estate agent. That's the brand I want to establish. We have to make a lot of content and constantly reinforce the fact that, you know, you're there to help people, you're very low key, you know, you're not like, let's say, a grand cardone mentality, which is nothing against it. It's just very different.
[00:24:23] Ask ask ask. Yeah, right, right. Did you ask five times for the sale?
[00:24:29] You know, so like that happens from repetition and what's really cool is this solves another problem a lot of folks have.
[00:24:35] When I talked a lot of folks, they say, okay, well, I know I need to make content. I have a couple ideas, but what what's the fourth video I make?
[00:24:43] Right. The nice thing is you don't have to make a novel piece of content every time. And I wouldn't recommend that you even do because that makes it harder to have a consistent brand.
[00:24:54] It's really more about having those topics, those content pillars, whatever makes sense for you and whatever is something more authentic for you.
[00:25:01] That is going to be the best type of content pillars to create, whether it's, you know, I help, let's say, first time home buyers or I have an agent I work with in Seattle who helps almost primarily medical folks because it's a big medical community and also newly divorced women oftentimes.
[00:25:21] And it feels very niche, but there's a market for them and she can be kind of the expert in that field in Seattle.
[00:25:28] And so by repeating that content topics, it tells you what kind of stuff you should talk about.
[00:25:34] And it makes you don't have to feel like you have to write a brand new book every time you're getting on video.
[00:25:39] But it also reinforces the brand as long as it's the right brand that you want to identify with.
[00:25:44] So volume and sticking to two to three content topics, you know, that's really I think the kind of where to get started with building that brand.
[00:25:53] And the idea is what we want to get people hooked on our content based on certain topics, right? So we want, you know, if I was doing a daily post in the recruiting REALTOR space, because that's where I play, I might have a tip of broker tip or agent tip of the week on Monday, Tuesday might be
[00:26:14] you know, I don't know, could be other things, right? So we could have different different topics, different days of the week.
[00:26:22] Let's ask a really fun question, which you get asked all the time is which social media platform should I be focusing on?
[00:26:29] Yes, I get this all the time.
[00:26:31] And it's my answer is probably not what most people think. I think most people expect me to say Facebook or or sorry, TikTok or YouTube.
[00:26:42] Honestly, it's whatever platform that you are currently on the most, because all of these platforms, they all have the exact same business model pretty much, which is just the more people stand the platform, the more ads they see, the more money that platform makes.
[00:26:57] So they reward content that makes people want to stay longer. So that's the business model on whatever platform we're on. Now they have different features and yes, slightly different things, YouTube more of a search engine, you know, TikToks like more primarily short form.
[00:27:12] So you have all that, but it's such such a barrier to entry to make a lot of content. And the best way you can grow is just to the fastest ways to make a lot of content.
[00:27:21] And you should really just be focused on trying to get rid of as many barriers to entry as possible.
[00:27:26] So if you're on Instagram every day, let's say, make Instagram content. Don't worry about the other platforms. Focus on where your strength already is, because you already know that platform is less of a learning curve.
[00:27:38] And it should be a quicker process to make it because you'll feel more comfortable. Whereas if you're like, I got to figure out how to make Facebook videos and I have to figure out how to do the SEO for YouTube that I've never done.
[00:27:48] It's less like you, you're going to do it, which means you're going to make less content. You're going to learn slower and it's going to be harder to compete.
[00:27:55] So ultimately, it's less about the in my experience, it's less about the platform and like the tips and tricks and little algorithm differences they have far more about how do we make this practical for your busy schedule.
[00:28:07] Yeah, and if anyone's out there listening and thinking, I don't know where my clients or my friends, where they spend the most amount of time, what social platform they're using, ask them, you know, do a survey, say, hey, you know, do you use TikTok, if so, how often every day is it what's your go to social media app, you know, and you could ask that as a single question.
[00:28:31] That would probably tell you everything you wanted to know what is your go to social media app, you could send that out to all of your sphere of influence and that will give you a pretty good idea of where the people already in your sphere hanging out.
[00:28:44] Yeah, that's, that's a great, it's a great tip and I think 100% and also just you should always be talking with folks who you think are your target market because you'll never, you'll never not learn enough for it to be worth it.
[00:28:56] But also the nice thing too, a lot of times people say, oh, well, Facebook's dead right I should probably ignore that platform 300 million active users in the US alone monthly active users on Facebook.
[00:29:10] Like that's basically we're getting close to the population of the US is a monthly active user on the platform.
[00:29:16] So the platform that people think our is dead has a ton of people on it.
[00:29:21] So I think pretty much every platform outside of maybe like TikTok just because it skews very young, but I'm sure that will change very soon is pretty much almost guaranteed to have your demographic on it.
[00:29:35] It's far more about how do you stand out in the platform than it is and I'm making sure this is the perfect platform for me at least in my experience.
[00:29:42] Yeah, let's talk about standing out in the in the whatever platform you end up using.
[00:29:47] So how should someone think about rising above maybe some of the other content getting because you said something very important you said sort of social media 1.0 was you know you sort of get your group together and then you can feed that group with your content.
[00:30:02] Well now everyone is so interconnected that people's groups aren't really their groups anymore because they are in a million other groups as well and you're sort of competing for you know attention.
[00:30:14] And you know Facebook now when you do you talked about you know you post a video you might only get 100 views and that might feel like a failure when reality that might be 100 people who might consider using you as a client and maybe if 10% of them use you that's 10 out of 100.
[00:30:31] And that's a really good return on investment you know if if that were to happen I don't think you know you would get 10 clients out of 100 views but the point is is you know now what you really have to do is is there's so much signal to noise you have to figure out how to how to rise above so how does somebody start to think about because you know if we post a just listed just sold or or video and we don't get a bunch of engagement that can feel crummy right.
[00:30:58] Like you were saying so part of what is getting the mindset of you know there isn't failure or success there's just result and also you know I'm not comparing myself like you know to Mr. Beast or or you know Logan Paul like you said but also figuring out how to sort of show showcase your content or why the social media platforms would showcase your content above someone else's so maybe we could say that.
[00:31:28] Yeah it's a great thing to dissect so it is 100% true that you know people obviously want to stand out and we've talked about it's a very competitive field so that's very crucial especially in the purely organic social media world right if we're not running any kind of like ad campaigns then our organics really got to stand on its own right as a to be worth our time investment.
[00:31:54] I find there's there's two separate kind of mindsets about standing out there standing out in terms of like social proof whereas like you can be the most viewed agent in your market and you can be the most let's say followed agent in your market and with that comes a lot of credibility even I talk with folks about this all the time they say okay well if we're in the social media 2.0 world well what good is followers followers are still great it's like.
[00:32:23] Like having a lot of reviews it shows people hey there's a lot of people who back this person who have invested time and and value their content it's not easy to get subscribers or to get followers that gives you a an advantage over somebody with like 100 followers it's it's a very true there's actually a without getting too much into the weeds there's a social media ad strategy where you simply put out an ad and the first objective the first goal of the ad is just to get a lot of engagement so that when you couldn't
[00:32:53] get a word into a ad that tries to drive traffic or tries to get leads or whatever it's got a lot of social proof a lot of people liking and coming just to actually increase the conversion rate so it's a tried and true strategy and that kind of brand awareness social proof aspect of standing out is very strong.
[00:33:13] Now that's one way to think about things and that strategy would be very different another one is how do I stand out purely to my ideal customers whereas like you were saying DJ maybe I only get 100 views but if these 100 views are really qualified folks that could be plenty of business for me for a year you know and depending on the market and all that kind of stuff so.
[00:33:35] So you can stand out by being the biggest or you can stand out by just targeting the best being the most accurate and what's really cool is that the algorithm is makes it very easy to get in front of people who want to watch your content oftentimes we say you know people say all the algorithm didn't like my post or YouTube didn't like this or Instagram didn't like this the best way to think about this stuff is that replace the word algorithm with audience say no my audience didn't like this.
[00:34:06] Because remember these platforms liver diet by how long people stay on them so they're very good at giving them giving people content that they want to see.
[00:34:14] So we should trust in the power of that algorithm to serve the right kind of content to the right kind of folks because it's in their inherent you know benefit and so if we make a video that's hey here's a really specific tip about selling a house in you know upstate New York for instance where I'm at we know that people who see that are really going to be interested in the market.
[00:34:35] So I'm not interested in whether that's a thousand or a hundred and so sometimes getting fewer viewers is actually a good strategy depending on how you want to look at it most people want to be the biggest and the best and that's totally cool it just takes a different level of input there and a lot of times the tricky thing with like especially we talk about platforms like Instagram.
[00:34:58] There's a lot of bot like you know bot followers and like bot like following like strategies going on that makes it almost useless to try to compete in purely that world but you can run hybrid strategies where you get a lot of viewership that's real viewership and can help you be the most viewed agent in your market and that's actually something that we do with some clients depending on what their needs are.
[00:35:23] Yeah I was thinking about if you live in Syracuse and if I was to move to Syracuse I and I've driven through Syracuse but I've never spent time in Syracuse so I this is a really good example because I know virtually nothing about Syracuse so other than the basketball but but but are there that other than the university.
[00:35:45] My first question or my first Google search might be or one of my first Google searches would be best neighborhoods in Syracuse or best restaurants or best schools or best you know a shopping or where the safest areas where you know things that you know any homeowner with you know whether they have a family or not are going to want to know prior to moving into an area.
[00:36:15] And so if I'm hearing you correctly what we could do is start creating those hyper specific answers to questions like and you can even get more granular than you know where in Syracuse should I live being like let's explore this neighborhood this time and let's talk about this neighborhood or this street or or even you know you can get as detailed as you want but are we talking about getting going that deep into like hey let's talk about this neighborhood today.
[00:36:44] Yeah I think 100% and and that's really it's a great way to look at it because depending on a lot of a lot of people deal with this where they're like well maybe I'm in a highly sought out destination and funny enough Syracuse was never that but nothing against Syracuse is just you know we're we usually we're an exporter of snowboard snowbirds to places like Florida generally speaking.
[00:37:08] However we have like a large micron large massive chip manufacturing company building a huge factory here so we're going through a really interesting period where now agents are like well I know I can actually target viewers in the rest of the states you know who might be moving here for that massive infrastructure growth and it's it's interesting so we're seeing a lot of agents kind of going through that right now but even if like your even if you're an area that is it's far more your
[00:37:38] that people aren't moving into necessarily right right but that's why it's so important to know your audience because then maybe you want to make content that's kind of more wide reaching for folks kind of coming there or in a lot of cases you're helping somebody go from you know like let's say if you're if they're already like in like L.A.
[00:37:55] area roughly maybe you're helping somebody go from like studio city to Burbank right it's like the same same basic thing right it's going to be slightly different town cultures and that kind of stuff.
[00:38:05] And so it's really important to know your audience but yeah when we get granular with our content helps us really of course pinpoint people who are specifically in that like let's say you the chances of you saying hey I'm the best real estate agent in Burbank work with me and getting getting like a real client from that is way less so then like hey I just helped somebody in Burbank by this kind of house it was their dream home because they're looking for this kind of cultural living and these kinds of benefits and.
[00:38:35] All that stuff that Burbank's known for we had amazing experience we looked at all this stuff that kind of more narrative driven before and after kind of content targeting people specifically looking to move to Burbank it's way more powerful and way more likely to get real tangible results for folks so I say the more granular you can go the better.
[00:38:55] Yeah so getting really hyper specific so I want an interview to a top REALTOR who was in a smaller more rural area I mean it wasn't a super small market but it wasn't a destination people would be you know wanting necessarily to move into an any sort of mass scale like a Nashville or a Charleston or Austin or these sort of hot hot spots where people are moving these days so she goes well people aren't really moving in here but she goes people move up within the city.
[00:39:25] Within my geographic area so in other words people buy their first house typically over around this area and then they're thinking about what's you know if that's not there forever home where's their next house and so she started making content going hey where's you know here's some ideas for your next house in XYZ you know area.
[00:39:47] Yeah 100% and that's again you have to you have to be conscious of who you're targeting and that's why people say in the social media world niche down and a lot of times the thought is like well I don't want to isolate myself from people like I don't want somebody who's like who wants to live in Culver City to see my Burbank content right apparently we're all a whole LA geography show now.
[00:40:10] But you know I don't want somebody to see my content and then think oh they only help people in Burbank but the the misstep there is that your content only really has a shot to be competitive if you can really be niche and stand out because otherwise you know something that you know Dwayne the Rock Johnson Post is going to be next and forget about the other agents in your right it's going to be people it's going to be these crazy people spending millions of dollars making content like Mr. Beaster or millions of other folks.
[00:40:42] So I want to work with people who want to live in Burbank let's talk about the specifics in Burbank and also what maybe somebody needs to know if they're ready to buy or sell so that when I get in front of the people who are ready to buy or sell algorithmically they should be more likely to see my content and when they do they say wow this person is explaining my exact scenario right now why would I not work with them.
[00:41:05] Now let's let's talk about if we do have a question of a niche down question that we're trying to answer for via social media maybe it's why should I why should I live in Burbank or what are the reasons that people choose to live in Burbank and let's say we're going down that path.
[00:41:25] How do we determine sort of how long a video should be let's talk about length and you know frequency so if we want to do it now again you could make a million different videos about living in Burbank do you recommend making longer form of videos where we address many questions or shorter form videos that address just one question and then making more videos you know for each question has its own video.
[00:41:53] Yeah it's a great it's a great question and I think a lot of times people think hey I want to take like a longer form content because then I can cut it down into a lot of short form content that from a efficiency perspective in terms of editing makes perfect sense especially if you already have an audience but for a lot of folks their content they might not know what really works yet and that's where testing is so important and I would say test with not only the content that's easier to make that you can make more of so you can make more of it.
[00:42:23] You can make more tests and get a better result but also just the thing that tests better is short form content the reason for that is pure short form video content to be specific the reason for that is because one video is just it's the best way to communicate a brand just because you're taking care of all the sensory elements that we can actually use.
[00:42:42] But then also it's just it's the fastest way to transfer authenticity and on top of that there's a huge algorithm benefit to it right everyone's competing to be the short form platform right now and so when you do that it's easier to get tests and the reason why you'll get like three to one or four to one or five to one views on a short form versus a long form is because it's less of a commitment right I think a lot of times we make content for people we think well this is valuable information therefore it's valuable content but we actually have to take a step into the process of the content.
[00:43:12] So I'm going to step back and say okay well what's the most precious commodity or precious resource that anybody has which is time and when somebody pays attention to your content they're paying in their time and so when we think about it from that approach you're saying hey I'm asking this person to watch my video over scrolling and immediately finding something that will be infinitely valuable and entertaining to them I'm asking them to spend their time their limited time they'll never get back on my content when we think about it from that perspective it may be a lot of things that I'm going to do is I'm going to do that.
[00:43:42] It's really far easier to understand why content doesn't take off when we just kind of you know maybe put it out there with no strategy so I recommend take a lot of time to test make short form video content because it's easy to produce I just just do it with your iPhone don't don't spend a bunch of money on a whole studio until you start to find okay well these topics these really work and as long as that of course is relevant to our brand then let's start investing in doubling down into maybe long form or
[00:44:12] maybe podcasts or things like that when we know it's a topic that resonates with the right folks.
[00:44:18] So a question about posting is that yeah so start with short form eventually you can just because you can do them more efficiently more
[00:44:30] efficiently certainly and my question is how do you measure the effectiveness of a short form video.
[00:44:38] Yeah so there's a couple of key KPIs you know keep performance indicators that I think make the most sense for folks and so you have reach which is the number of individuals your content gets in front of if you go if you post on Facebook or Instagram you should you hopefully you're doing this with a business account I highly recommend it.
[00:45:00] A lot of people use personal accounts you can it's just it's hard to attract this information so that's why the benefit of the business account it exists.
[00:45:08] So if you make a business page and you make like a Instagram account and you attach it to your Facebook and all that annoying hoops hoops that they make you jump through when you go into your insights tab or you go into meta meta business dot Facebook dot com which will open up what's called meta business suite apologize that Facebook makes everything super difficult but they do they sure do.
[00:45:28] It's when I was there I was like why are you making it so tough for people to use your stuff and to give you their money because the ads platform is nuts.
[00:45:38] It's so complex I'm like this is so counterintuitive but anyway if you go through it and you make like a meta business suite account which should be fairly easy you might already have one not even know it you can track all of your results here and the main KPIs I would focus on is reach that should be your bread and butter in the beginning because again if we're putting it in the beginning
[00:45:58] and we're putting out organic content we can market for the most part especially if we're staying on brand and not just making crazy trend videos because we think it might go viral.
[00:46:07] If we're talking about the stuff that is on brand for us as a business as a real estate agent then we should know our reach is going to be getting in front of people because it's registering with what they want to see.
[00:46:17] So reach is probably the biggest one impressions people get the two mixed up reaches the number of individuals your content gets in front of impressions are the number of times like your video for instance has been seen all together.
[00:46:31] So let's say five people you reach five people hopefully way more than that and you get 10 impressions it's every person saw probably two times basically that's how that works out.
[00:46:41] So the reach is really the most important thing but you also have things like you know of course click through rate if you have content that clicks through depending on the platform that will show you really high levels of intent.
[00:46:56] But I wouldn't focus too much on things like likes and comments just because people can love content and not comment on it.
[00:47:04] I don't comment on anything.
[00:47:07] Well this is this is a podcast we net not shouldn't say never rarely do we I mean we do get we do get our listener feedback we get them in the way of people leave reviews or the email us but 99.99% of our listeners have never reached out to us or done any sort of engagement other than download a listen to the episode.
[00:47:27] Yeah and you know what I have I'm working with the real estate agent in Florida they had an amazing story I'm so glad they shared it they said um they started making YouTube's kind of their platform they started making YouTube videos for a long time for like years.
[00:47:41] They had a I believe it was a listing agent reach out to them and they said hey you know you're representing Lisa on this home purchase right I don't remember the name let's say it was Lisa.
[00:47:53] They said I don't know who this person is they said oh that they said that you're their agent turns out a viewer of this person's content had been watching them for so long they called up about a house and then when they asked what was the agent they just named the agent that they've been watching forever.
[00:48:08] Which is so funny and kind of a perfect scenario for any real estate agent out there right that's the dream right there but they have no idea because it's not like this person DM them or commented or anything it just goes to show the power of views is really strong there regardless of if they hit the like button or even the subscribe button or the follow button.
[00:48:27] And it's because they're people are wired for connection and through social media we're looking for people to relate to to connect with we're looking for problems to be solved but it's all interpersonal right so we have to think about these social media is this interpersonal exchange and to really think about how do I service how do I service the people with with this content.
[00:48:57] So okay, so we talked about the metrics of looking at reaches is most important how just just as a general example how often do you think someone should be making video content and posted yeah I mean honestly.
[00:49:14] The only hesitation I have about should is because everyone is different right and for instance like let's say let's say you have an amazing strategy of I don't know cold emailing let's say you get a ton of business from that social media I'm obviously I'm biased toward it but it's just one marketing sure like so I would I would be wrong to say like hey take time away from this amazing cold email strategy that's getting you business and throw it into testing the waters and so.
[00:49:42] And I'm not sure if you're going to do social media but what I will say is that ideally I would make a video once per day not actually because of algorithmically they're being some secret there but just because if you do anything once a day for long enough a it's not that hard to do especially if you just fill it with your phone talk about things that you already know about I mean you can make content really in 60 seconds and post it pretty much immediately.
[00:50:07] It's not much of a lift everyone has time for that and if you do that every day for a month you're going to build a habit and once you build that habit it's not like oh man I got to jump through these hoops to make the social media content it'll be second nature to you so I would recommend that if you're brand new honestly at the end of the day really the more content the better the only thing I'll say is that one platform I've seen a little issue with is I wouldn't post more than like two times a day to Instagram tends to have a lot of things that I'm going to do.
[00:50:36] I'm not going to post negative results but for the most part the more content you have the more people you'll get in front of but also the more information you'll have which makes you make better choices and build a stronger strategy and it becomes very difficult to fail when you have that much information and data on your side.
[00:50:53] We should also mention too that that's strictly the the act of doing this exercise daily making a short form video each day I remember reading a book by the person who mentored Mr. Beast it was an analytics guy and Mr. Beast basically said assume your first hundred videos are going to be just terrible.
[00:51:16] He says don't worry about it they're going to be and once you're done with them you'll look back on them and you'll know what I mean but he said but the good news is you're going to get better at it every single time so that I think is also something that agents can forget is they post some videos they don't have the whatever metric they're looking for the result isn't there the engagement isn't there they didn't get phone calls there are likes there were comments and there's if they're still developing their skill set and they're still continuing to try to do it.
[00:51:46] If they try to improve then ultimately you know if you if they just keep going down the path they are going to get better at it and if they're looking at their their their analytics they're going to know what's working and what isn't and if they hire somebody like you you can actually help them figure all of this out.
[00:52:03] Yeah that's that's exactly right it's really like one of my favorite quotes and I apply it to marketing though it applied to to military before was just that was a Napoleon quote I oh my god now I'm forgetting it's it's something along the lines of you know like volume is a essentially a benefit in and of itself right I'm butchering the quote but essentially it's that you know we talk about like oh what should I be wearing like what kind of light should I use what kind of light should I use.
[00:52:32] So I can do something like that kind of microphone should I use and we do that but like the power of just doing something over and over again no matter what your starting point is is truly the biggest compounding vehicle.
[00:52:43] It's if you do something a hundred times like in the the Mr. Beast example eventually you will suck so little you will actually be good.
[00:52:51] Right it's not about even getting good it's about sucking less yeah yeah but eventually it's it is a spectrum it's not like you're good or bad it's how good are you and so eventually you will be you will be so bad.
[00:53:02] If you're not being bad you'll actually be good and that's one of my that's one of my favorite quotes when it comes to content creation.
[00:53:07] And we could we could get into deeper conversations about the sort of the nature of content whether it's a content that's disposable or content that sticks around YouTube is more of a stick around you know it's a search engine so it's a repository it is I like to think of it as it's well I think AI is now taking over this this mantle but prior to AI being accessible to to the rest of us.
[00:53:32] Was this was like our Oracle at Delphi this was our answer Google and and YouTube were our answers you know we are this was what we said you know mysteries of the universe and they will they will give us those answers and now you know this when we have content that people will we call evergreen that they'll you know content that can kind of live indefinitely because it's applicable all the time you know then you could put some of that content on some of those more repository.
[00:54:04] So you know it's like a really good video on a particular neighborhood in Syracuse that people are searching to learn about well that might serve me for years and years I mean maybe I'll have to update it at some point but it will serve me while I'm sleeping it will be there whereas it fits on Instagram or Facebook.
[00:54:22] It tends to be more disposable people aren't you know I mean they could look at you know your previous posts and they they could find it.
[00:54:29] But it's not Facebook and Instagram really aren't search engines I mean technically they are but it's not really how people use them right yeah and that's that's a great way to put it to a set there is a massive power of evergreen content when we work with real estate agents we try and make content topics that are almost exclusively evergreen for that very reason.
[00:54:50] That being said and you are 100% right that the evergreen aspect of content on platforms like YouTube are far stronger but I will I had a funny instance where a actually too funny instances from one client who actually happened to be before we really dived into just working primarily with real estate agents.
[00:55:09] We had we were working with a wine company we actually still are but they created a video which is how to use like a wine opener right this electric wine opener they put it up on YouTube years ago five six years ago before I ever met any of them.
[00:55:26] To this day every year that video accounts for probably 90% of their total views because every year on December 25th everyone opens up that Corvin wine opener brand and they don't know how to use it and gets what's the go to video of how to use it yeah this video this guy made five years ago.
[00:55:47] Which is so funny but yeah and another funny note though too is that generally there is more short term aspect on platforms like Instagram especially.
[00:55:58] We had a video that like I was looking at for a client the other day that was going I was going through I saw a bunch of likes coming on like oh man they really like the new piece of content is a video from two weeks ago that's still researching just because it was it was some user generated content people really liked it was funny and that kind of took off but.
[00:56:16] It is very funny I do recommend people if you really want to benefit from content as much as possible evergreen will serve you the best just because you you're giving your chance yourself a longer horizon for people to discover it and get value from it now tell me tell us about Jarvis media what do you do specifically for real estate agents.
[00:56:36] Yeah so appreciate that our our main focus is again giving really tangible results for people without having to you know become a content creator and so we do this a lot of ways what we ultimately really have kind of found a nation is creating hybrid content what I mean by that as hybrid between.
[00:56:56] Organic and paid the reason for this is because if you're real estate agent you have very limited time you have to make content you know to to be relevant on social media but your time has a monetary value itself so for agents who are at a certain level we find hey let's make the best piece of organic content we possibly can and then implement a really minor very like a scrappy paid budget with it as well that not only helps us get in front of more people but.
[00:57:25] Target more specifically to which we can't do as much on the organic side so we've built our whole model out of having agents come on we do a one hour a month call with them we get a whole months worth of content and then we edit at all deliver all the content to all their platforms so that they can focus on what they're best at which is being an awesome agent.
[00:57:43] So let me make sure I understand so the idea is you know make make a really great piece of content and then possibly.
[00:57:51] Because it's somewhat disposable on Facebook Instagram what we'll use a paid campaign to redirect attention back to that content is that my understanding yeah we'll squeeze that organic orange for as much as it's worth and then implement that in a paid strategy which allows us to.
[00:58:09] Target again more specifically and test more accurately because then you start to get out of the weeds of like well maybe Tuesday more people saw than Wednesday you start to really get a much clearer representation of the content that resonates when you're able to a be test so perfectly with ads and that's how we help to make content that just gets better and better month over month and again the time savings is really what people care about this hey how can I work with you and just do one hour a month.
[00:58:35] You help me make the content and then I can just focus on the other aspects of my business that are super important.
[00:58:41] Yeah I love that if anyone is interested in working with Cole and he has had some unbelievable results remember he worked at Tik Tok and Facebook he knows how the sauces made and he or the how the sausages made we sit we would say in Chicago but.
[00:58:59] But certainly he is there's nothing more frustrating than creating a wonderful a good piece of content that we know is good but because we don't have the right strategy to distribute it out to the it's not that necessarily the audience rejected the content they might not have seen it and and this is something that happens with just listed in just sold you know post all the time is somebody says hey I just did this cool thing and here here's a.
[00:59:26] You're a picture of it and they don't get a lot of likes and they're like oh I guess people weren't happy for me no it's that that Facebook probably knows that that's not a super engaging post because it's just basically an advertisement for yourself or about or a little congratulatory thing they understand that's pretty disposable and doesn't really help their platform all that much so they're going to push that content down and they want something that really grips somebody and once you know you don't want to keep them on so the ideas you might create this great content but you don't exactly know how to put it on the market.
[00:59:56] Push it out the right way that's where you guys can come in and say hey we're going to throw in some paid strategy as well to really manually push some some eyeballs over to this because that will give us the real feedback on how it's working and then we can just continually make updates you know that is a brilliant strategy I love that is I love that so for anyone out there that is interested in working with Cole Jarvis Cole Jarvis sorry Cole what is your what's your.

Let me tell you more about Cole with experience working at Facebook, TikTok, I Heart Media, and Coldwell Banker. Cole has developed social media strategies that help real estate agents of all sizes see massive brand growth using internal knowledge of how social media platforms operate. Cole knows what works, what doesn't work, and what actually makes a difference for the bottom line of a real estate agent. Leveraging smart content creation and combining it with robust paid advertising, Cole has generated, check this out, almost 500,000 followers, 488,000 followers to be exact, and reach over 39 million prospects for his agents, which are his clients, saving them almost $1 million a year for, sorry, saving them almost $1 million for the cost of hiring an internal social media manager. So he's basically showing agents how to do this without having to hire somebody as a manager and he gets unbelievable results. I want everybody to check out Jarvis Media at Jarvismediaco.com, J-A-R-V-I-S, mediaco.co. We will have a link to that in the show notes. Cole, welcome to the show. Thanks, TJ. I really appreciate it. I am really excited to chat with you because there's always more that I could learn about effective social media strategy and also, you know, it's such a changing environment. You know, there's always updates. There's always things that used to work that don't work anymore. So I'm excited to kind of dive in and get the state of social media marketing these days. I think a lot of agents, you know, have for years have been told you need to post more. You need to post, you know, more frequently. You need to do more video. You need to, you know, ultimately really, you know, create this, this, this presence and this consistent presence. But there's not always an easy sort of, you know, guide, a series of guide posts along the way. You just sort of sort of have to figure out what that is. So I'm excited to kind of dive into some of that today with you. But let's get started with your background. Tell us like, how did you get into social media? Yeah, funny enough, I got into social media via radio in a weird way. It's kind of funny. But yeah, I'm pretty much out of school. I was working at I Heart Media in upstate New York where I'm from. And I was like a promotions assistant. We'd go to the concerts and all these different like shows and stuff like that. And we would help the digital content director, you know, get a bunch of content and help him do his strategy for all of the social media stuff that I didn't understand at the time. Shortly after he left and in the in the four months or so, it took them to replace them. I just decided, hey, I'm just going to take on these responsibilities and just kind of get a little, get a little buffer and job security here. And by the time they came around to hire, I was like, well, I'm kind of already doing this. Let me go ahead and go for it, even though I felt underqualified at the time. And got the position. And I was pretty instantly thrown into this world that I didn't understand. So huge learning curve. Didn't really know anything about algorithms about making content SEO. New nothing about Photoshop and Premiere, which I grew up in the content world right just right before Canva. And all these amazing tools that would have made my life so much easier. But, but you know, you kind of you figured out as you go and learn that process. It really just fell in love with social media. I went out to LA just something I'd always wanted to do lived with the buddy of mine out there. I was kind of looking for whatever job I could find and sure enough this company that I had no idea what it was at the time. TikTok was hiring. That became a really interesting play. I knew they were involved in social media, but I didn't know nearly how big of a player they'd become. So that was awesome. Spent some time at Cold War Banker, which I'm sure we'll talk about. And then ultimately the experience at TikTok gave me a couple years at Facebook. And then ever since then I've been kind of doing this on my own and it's been kind of a wild trajectory, honestly. It's really impressive that you have worked at corporate for some of these firms and really get to see at least to some degree how the donuts are made or at least what the thought process is about how the donuts are made. And what are the sort of ways in which they organize information and what are these platforms looking for from content creators. So let's dive into REALTORS using social media. So I guess the first thing that I'd like to ask you is what do REALTORS get wrong about social media? Yeah, oh, that's a great question. So in my from what I've seen with the obviously he's talked with a lot of agents all day long. Really, I think the thing that people get wrong, honestly, the biggest one and it's the biggest hindrance is just that they think it needs to be perfect. Your social media strategy is not so much catching lightning in a bottle as it is a constant process of trial and error. But also just kind of you know, putting like putting a grain of sand in the bottle as time goes on, sure there's a better analogy. But as you know, you really want to build this so that eventually you have so much content, so much goodwill, especially if it's targeting your your audience well in your market that you built up this goodwill you built up this helpful content that's helped people in their social media or sorry in their real estate journey whether they're buying or selling. And then when they already to buy or sell they say, hey, well, you know, John's his content's been helping me all along the way. Why wouldn't I work with him to buy or sell my home? And that's that's really the simplest approach is that, you know, we can take out and I'm sure we'll talk in detail about all the crazy algorithm stuff and all these little things which can be very helpful. But the meat and potatoes of it is you just want to make stuff that helps people and that puts you in a good light to set you up to be their real estate agent. That's really the end of all be all of it. Yeah, and in social media really gives us an opportunity to dial that message in because we're people's attention spans are are so shortened that we have mere seconds. So I know that agents can think, okay, well, then my video does need to be perfect because everything I see on Instagram looks perfect and all the filter, you know, there's filters and production value. And I will I'm not going to answer for coal, but I will I will encourage everyone to challenge that that that is the most effective strategy. As Cole said, the most effective strategy is giving people items of value things that actually will work for them because and then the actual production level of the, you know, whether it's a video or whatever is a little becomes less important. It's certainly is still important, but it is that accurate call that that the content sort of trumps the aesthetic. Yeah, what 100% it was so funny. I a lot of times I've worked a lot of video production companies in the past with kind of separate. You know, we've helped companies outside of just real estate agents, but we primarily help agents and usually we're just kind of working with them one on one. But we've worked with a lot of video production partners in different cases and it's so funny. A lot of these folks who have the best equipment, the best sound, the best lighting. Just talking on I think it was on Friday with a couple of folks who run a company out in a video production company out in Austin and they're saying, yeah, we'll purposefully make content lower quality. Because it resonates in a different way. And my hypothesis is not so much that the lower quality helps. It's actually more so just that the content is so much more important when people see it's something that looks like was filmed on an iPhone, even if it wasn't or even if it's still a professional company doing it. They feel like this is really user generated content. They feel like it's more real. Whereas the more produced content gets sometimes the more you risk it coming off like a commercial, which is the antithesis of what people want on social media platforms. Right. People want to. So that's it. That's something that we should really think about discussing right now is you just brought up a really great question. Do we want to have commercials on Facebook, Instagram, etc. Which outline how our benefits and features and why we're so amazing. And this isn't a yes, no question. I although I guess it could be. So do we want to do that and or do we also want to produce use what you would call more impromptu content content that isn't as highly produced isn't as slick isn't as scripted but more authentic and and really solve some sort of problem or answers a question that a client might have as I sort of understanding that correctly. Yeah, it's so there's it's so interesting. There's a lot of schools of thought when it comes to this. And ultimately, I would say like that the the real answer to anything in marketing, whether it's social media or otherwise is testing. So the real way is to test it. But the different schools of thought are very interesting. You have the Gary V model, which is the jab jab jab right hook. The idea there is you have three great pieces of content that are value driven for every one content that's like, hey, by the way, here's what I do. You can work with me. That's a strategy that's kind of actually more has become famous really from the TV model. You look at how much time you would spend watching the show versus how many times, you know, in a cable show you get commercials. That's like pretty close to the ratio. If not like, you know, for the four to one, maybe more more accurate. There's also more of like a slightly more nuanced kind of influence or like model that I think. A lot of people have popularized, but Alex Hermosi is one of the folks who've done this really well, which is simply like, you know, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give, give forever. And then ultimately you will receive because you will deposit so much good will that people will want to work with you both have proven to be super successful. And so you can implement more ad like content as long as the ratio to value is a lot higher. Ultimately, the best approaches to test that. But I actually believe also because real estate specifically is such a competitive space. And sometimes people don't realize it, but I'll tell folks that I'm talking with them. I'm like, listen, you're in your market. You're one of a thousand real estate agents all selling the exact same thing for the exact same price. Like that is a competitive market by definition. There are a few industries that are that competitive. And so I think the more you can be a unicorn, the better. And also I think it actually lends itself to be more conducive to the schedule of the average agent to just make content more authentically. Just do it with your smartphone. You don't need the fancy stuff and just try and answer the question. You know, what do I think people are struggling with in my market and real estate? You know, what are questions I'm commonly asked, which lends itself more towards the kind of the last thing you would mention the more authentic. Let me just try to solve a problem with content and maybe not make a huge commercial. A lot of different ways to approach it. But I think that last one is the best starting point because it means you don't have to, you know, spend a ton of time doing all of this preparation for like a fancy commercial to produce. Yeah, that absolutely makes sense. It's sort of the consumption model of marketing where we just want people consuming our content. So maybe real estate agents should think about, okay, if I want to find clients via social media, if I want to have people reach out to me, of course, the answer is yes, you likely do. So if that's true, then what we have to do is think of social media as as a stage to which we are now performing for the audience and what, you know, what, what does that audience want? What does that audience need? What do in what way do they want to receive this? Do they want to see pictures? Do they want to see video? And again, testing, there isn't, you know, answers really, the dry answers to all of this. There are, of course, themes and, you know, certainly directions of ways in which technology is heading and consumption changes. But it seems to be that what we really want is just good quality content. How, so you said, you know, make a list of questions your clients ask you essentially that that is one way. What do you think about the, hey, I just sold this house or I just listed this house, those kind of posts? What are, what are your sort of take on those? Yeah, so it's so funny because I think that the mentality behind posting, hey, just sold, just listed those classic posts that, you know, we see a lot of if you're an agent is especially if you're looking at other agents content. And the mentality is like, well, I just did some great work. I got this great review. I want to showcase it. And innately that, that makes sense, right? The problem is that it lends itself more to how social media maybe 1.0 was versus kind of the social media 2.0 world that we're in. Not that those are, I'm sure people have a better like, you know, phrase, theology for like the different eras of social media. But the way I think about it and this was, by the way, I can mark exactly when this happened because I was working at I heart and that first job when this shifted and it was a big, really hurtful shift, but essentially it used to be more like social media was almost like building an email list, you'd accumulate an audience and then once you had that audience, then you could distribute content and like for the most part, pretty much everyone would be distributed your content, right? Maybe a little bit less some days or other, but generally it was accumulative list and then service that list with your content. that has very much so shifted. And so now, regardless of the amount of followers you have good or bad, your content is much more of a meritocracy now. You have to earn every view now. And in some ways, that's great. If you were barriers to entry, some ways that's really hard. More effort, more time needed to get some great content. And so ultimately, when we create more content that's like, hey, here's all this good work I did. The reason that lends itself to the old model is because well, people would get your content either way. Now, because you have to earn every view, that is really hard to compete that piece of content against somebody's viral cat video. Or even what most people go on social media for, which is their friends or family, and trying to avoid business content, which is no hard for businesses to really grow organically purely from their content. And so I would say that it's better to lean away from that and maybe strategically sprinkle that in instead. So, hey, I just sold this house for my, these folks in this market and you name your market there because it's helpful for SEO and just for relevancy for your audience. Here's what they struggled with. Here's what we helped them with and kind of make it more and more of a narrative. It takes a little bit more effort than just posting a graphic, but ultimately, that's going to get more viewers for sure. You know, you brought up a really good point. It's like, what does the audience want? Do audiences really want commercials? Well, the answer isn't no. We certainly accept a certain level of commercial in our life. We see billboards, we watch television, you know, streaming services that can have ads as well. So it's not that we don't, I mean, I don't personally love commercials. I think most people don't love watching a commercial, but we tolerate it. But I think you're right. So I would tolerate somebody's just listing just sold in it and it's nice to see your friends succeed and all of that is great. But if I'm somebody who I'm looking for maybe new new, you know, new players into my new new leads, I am not, you know, that's probably not going to do the trick. I think if we're looking for for new clients, the way to do it is is to think about what are what are those clients searching for online? What problems are they trying to solve? Yeah, and I think that's important to I think the biggest difficulty I think most folks have with like a let's say a purely organic strategy is just that one, it takes a lot of effort into it takes a lot of time. And that's that's tough, especially for most agents who are like, well, I need a listing next month, otherwise I'm starting to get worried about, you know, my how far will my previous commission get me. And so and that's where it's really tough and where it does start to make sense kind of figuring out, of course, you know, where is your effort, where are your efforts best allocated. Now what's nice about, you know, cold marketing is that, you know, you can always do more. And what I always say is the way to really think about like viewership for instance, like let's say you get a hundred views. Most people would be depressed that they got a hundred views on a social media post. But the way to really think about this, especially if you're making content that you know is targeting the right audience, imagine that you had a small amphitheater of a hundred people and you could just address them basically whenever you wanted. Pretty much at will that would feel quite powerful. However, on social media, it doesn't feel nearly as powerful because of the fact that we see people with billions and millions of trillions of views, you know, flying all over the place and it feels like everyone's gotten amazing following besides us. So I think that's the important thing is we do need to separate the mindset, especially between like the influencer who is making content purely just to make content and that's the whole business strategy versus an agent who is trying to make content to help more people in their real estate business. And the amount of viewers is not nearly as important as the quality of the viewers. That's always something that is is a big tough point for people, I think to realize. But I think when you do it, it makes you feel better, makes you feel more encouraged to make more content. And also it's just it's a better way to think about it because you shouldn't compare yourself to the Logan Paul's who are making a viral content or Mr. Beast, for instance, who are kind of going off on on these crazy content creation experiences. So let's talk a little bit about branding because ultimately what we're really trying to do is evolve or serve our brand. So every agent is their own brand. I would argue, but how should someone start to create and I if they don't have a well defined brand, what should they do first? Yeah, great question. So what I always recommend and this actually kind of solves two problems in one. So we want to create a brand, we need to know, okay, what what is a brand? A brand is really just an association, right? It's saying, hey, this person represents these values. And that's why I like them or I dislike them, whatever it may be. And so when we're creating a brand, we know that we need to have a repetition of content, as we were talking about on social media here, that enforces that brand that represents whatever those brand, those content pillars are. So let's say you're a real estate agent and you're like, hey, I really want to be a no pressure real estate agent. That's the brand I want to establish. We have to make a lot of content and constantly reinforce the fact that, you know, you're there to help people, you're very low key, you know, you're not like, let's say, a grand cardone mentality, which is nothing against it. It's just very different. Ask ask ask. Yeah, right, right. Did you ask five times for the sale? You know, so like that happens from repetition and what's really cool is this solves another problem a lot of folks have. When I talked a lot of folks, they say, okay, well, I know I need to make content. I have a couple ideas, but what what's the fourth video I make? Right. The nice thing is you don't have to make a novel piece of content every time. And I wouldn't recommend that you even do because that makes it harder to have a consistent brand. It's really more about having those topics, those content pillars, whatever makes sense for you and whatever is something more authentic for you. That is going to be the best type of content pillars to create, whether it's, you know, I help, let's say, first time home buyers or I have an agent I work with in Seattle who helps almost primarily medical folks because it's a big medical community and also newly divorced women oftentimes. And it feels very niche, but there's a market for them and she can be kind of the expert in that field in Seattle. And so by repeating that content topics, it tells you what kind of stuff you should talk about. And it makes you don't have to feel like you have to write a brand new book every time you're getting on video. But it also reinforces the brand as long as it's the right brand that you want to identify with. So volume and sticking to two to three content topics, you know, that's really I think the kind of where to get started with building that brand. And the idea is what we want to get people hooked on our content based on certain topics, right? So we want, you know, if I was doing a daily post in the recruiting REALTOR space, because that's where I play, I might have a tip of broker tip or agent tip of the week on Monday, Tuesday might be you know, I don't know, could be other things, right? So we could have different different topics, different days of the week. Let's ask a really fun question, which you get asked all the time is which social media platform should I be focusing on? Yes, I get this all the time. And it's my answer is probably not what most people think. I think most people expect me to say Facebook or or sorry, TikTok or YouTube. Honestly, it's whatever platform that you are currently on the most, because all of these platforms, they all have the exact same business model pretty much, which is just the more people stand the platform, the more ads they see, the more money that platform makes. So they reward content that makes people want to stay longer. So that's the business model on whatever platform we're on. Now they have different features and yes, slightly different things, YouTube more of a search engine, you know, TikToks like more primarily short form. So you have all that, but it's such such a barrier to entry to make a lot of content. And the best way you can grow is just to the fastest ways to make a lot of content. And you should really just be focused on trying to get rid of as many barriers to entry as possible. So if you're on Instagram every day, let's say, make Instagram content. Don't worry about the other platforms. Focus on where your strength already is, because you already know that platform is less of a learning curve. And it should be a quicker process to make it because you'll feel more comfortable. Whereas if you're like, I got to figure out how to make Facebook videos and I have to figure out how to do the SEO for YouTube that I've never done. It's less like you, you're going to do it, which means you're going to make less content. You're going to learn slower and it's going to be harder to compete. So ultimately, it's less about the in my experience, it's less about the platform and like the tips and tricks and little algorithm differences they have far more about how do we make this practical for your busy schedule. Yeah, and if anyone's out there listening and thinking, I don't know where my clients or my friends, where they spend the most amount of time, what social platform they're using, ask them, you know, do a survey, say, hey, you know, do you use TikTok, if so, how often every day is it what's your go to social media app, you know, and you could ask that as a single question. That would probably tell you everything you wanted to know what is your go to social media app, you could send that out to all of your sphere of influence and that will give you a pretty good idea of where the people already in your sphere hanging out. Yeah, that's, that's a great, it's a great tip and I think 100% and also just you should always be talking with folks who you think are your target market because you'll never, you'll never not learn enough for it to be worth it. But also the nice thing too, a lot of times people say, oh, well, Facebook's dead right I should probably ignore that platform 300 million active users in the US alone monthly active users on Facebook. Like that's basically we're getting close to the population of the US is a monthly active user on the platform. So the platform that people think our is dead has a ton of people on it. So I think pretty much every platform outside of maybe like TikTok just because it skews very young, but I'm sure that will change very soon is pretty much almost guaranteed to have your demographic on it. It's far more about how do you stand out in the platform than it is and I'm making sure this is the perfect platform for me at least in my experience. Yeah, let's talk about standing out in the in the whatever platform you end up using. So how should someone think about rising above maybe some of the other content getting because you said something very important you said sort of social media 1.0 was you know you sort of get your group together and then you can feed that group with your content. Well now everyone is so interconnected that people's groups aren't really their groups anymore because they are in a million other groups as well and you're sort of competing for you know attention. And you know Facebook now when you do you talked about you know you post a video you might only get 100 views and that might feel like a failure when reality that might be 100 people who might consider using you as a client and maybe if 10% of them use you that's 10 out of 100. And that's a really good return on investment you know if if that were to happen I don't think you know you would get 10 clients out of 100 views but the point is is you know now what you really have to do is is there's so much signal to noise you have to figure out how to how to rise above so how does somebody start to think about because you know if we post a just listed just sold or or video and we don't get a bunch of engagement that can feel crummy right. Like you were saying so part of what is getting the mindset of you know there isn't failure or success there's just result and also you know I'm not comparing myself like you know to Mr. Beast or or you know Logan Paul like you said but also figuring out how to sort of show showcase your content or why the social media platforms would showcase your content above someone else's so maybe we could say that. Yeah it's a great thing to dissect so it is 100% true that you know people obviously want to stand out and we've talked about it's a very competitive field so that's very crucial especially in the purely organic social media world right if we're not running any kind of like ad campaigns then our organics really got to stand on its own right as a to be worth our time investment. I find there's there's two separate kind of mindsets about standing out there standing out in terms of like social proof whereas like you can be the most viewed agent in your market and you can be the most let's say followed agent in your market and with that comes a lot of credibility even I talk with folks about this all the time they say okay well if we're in the social media 2.0 world well what good is followers followers are still great it's like. Like having a lot of reviews it shows people hey there's a lot of people who back this person who have invested time and and value their content it's not easy to get subscribers or to get followers that gives you a an advantage over somebody with like 100 followers it's it's a very true there's actually a without getting too much into the weeds there's a social media ad strategy where you simply put out an ad and the first objective the first goal of the ad is just to get a lot of engagement so that when you couldn't get a word into a ad that tries to drive traffic or tries to get leads or whatever it's got a lot of social proof a lot of people liking and coming just to actually increase the conversion rate so it's a tried and true strategy and that kind of brand awareness social proof aspect of standing out is very strong. Now that's one way to think about things and that strategy would be very different another one is how do I stand out purely to my ideal customers whereas like you were saying DJ maybe I only get 100 views but if these 100 views are really qualified folks that could be plenty of business for me for a year you know and depending on the market and all that kind of stuff so. So you can stand out by being the biggest or you can stand out by just targeting the best being the most accurate and what's really cool is that the algorithm is makes it very easy to get in front of people who want to watch your content oftentimes we say you know people say all the algorithm didn't like my post or YouTube didn't like this or Instagram didn't like this the best way to think about this stuff is that replace the word algorithm with audience say no my audience didn't like this. Because remember these platforms liver diet by how long people stay on them so they're very good at giving them giving people content that they want to see. So we should trust in the power of that algorithm to serve the right kind of content to the right kind of folks because it's in their inherent you know benefit and so if we make a video that's hey here's a really specific tip about selling a house in you know upstate New York for instance where I'm at we know that people who see that are really going to be interested in the market. So I'm not interested in whether that's a thousand or a hundred and so sometimes getting fewer viewers is actually a good strategy depending on how you want to look at it most people want to be the biggest and the best and that's totally cool it just takes a different level of input there and a lot of times the tricky thing with like especially we talk about platforms like Instagram. There's a lot of bot like you know bot followers and like bot like following like strategies going on that makes it almost useless to try to compete in purely that world but you can run hybrid strategies where you get a lot of viewership that's real viewership and can help you be the most viewed agent in your market and that's actually something that we do with some clients depending on what their needs are. Yeah I was thinking about if you live in Syracuse and if I was to move to Syracuse I and I've driven through Syracuse but I've never spent time in Syracuse so I this is a really good example because I know virtually nothing about Syracuse so other than the basketball but but but are there that other than the university. My first question or my first Google search might be or one of my first Google searches would be best neighborhoods in Syracuse or best restaurants or best schools or best you know a shopping or where the safest areas where you know things that you know any homeowner with you know whether they have a family or not are going to want to know prior to moving into an area. And so if I'm hearing you correctly what we could do is start creating those hyper specific answers to questions like and you can even get more granular than you know where in Syracuse should I live being like let's explore this neighborhood this time and let's talk about this neighborhood or this street or or even you know you can get as detailed as you want but are we talking about getting going that deep into like hey let's talk about this neighborhood today. Yeah I think 100% and and that's really it's a great way to look at it because depending on a lot of a lot of people deal with this where they're like well maybe I'm in a highly sought out destination and funny enough Syracuse was never that but nothing against Syracuse is just you know we're we usually we're an exporter of snowboard snowbirds to places like Florida generally speaking. However we have like a large micron large massive chip manufacturing company building a huge factory here so we're going through a really interesting period where now agents are like well I know I can actually target viewers in the rest of the states you know who might be moving here for that massive infrastructure growth and it's it's interesting so we're seeing a lot of agents kind of going through that right now but even if like your even if you're an area that is it's far more your that people aren't moving into necessarily right right but that's why it's so important to know your audience because then maybe you want to make content that's kind of more wide reaching for folks kind of coming there or in a lot of cases you're helping somebody go from you know like let's say if you're if they're already like in like L.A. area roughly maybe you're helping somebody go from like studio city to Burbank right it's like the same same basic thing right it's going to be slightly different town cultures and that kind of stuff. And so it's really important to know your audience but yeah when we get granular with our content helps us really of course pinpoint people who are specifically in that like let's say you the chances of you saying hey I'm the best real estate agent in Burbank work with me and getting getting like a real client from that is way less so then like hey I just helped somebody in Burbank by this kind of house it was their dream home because they're looking for this kind of cultural living and these kinds of benefits and. All that stuff that Burbank's known for we had amazing experience we looked at all this stuff that kind of more narrative driven before and after kind of content targeting people specifically looking to move to Burbank it's way more powerful and way more likely to get real tangible results for folks so I say the more granular you can go the better. Yeah so getting really hyper specific so I want an interview to a top REALTOR who was in a smaller more rural area I mean it wasn't a super small market but it wasn't a destination people would be you know wanting necessarily to move into an any sort of mass scale like a Nashville or a Charleston or Austin or these sort of hot hot spots where people are moving these days so she goes well people aren't really moving in here but she goes people move up within the city. Within my geographic area so in other words people buy their first house typically over around this area and then they're thinking about what's you know if that's not there forever home where's their next house and so she started making content going hey where's you know here's some ideas for your next house in XYZ you know area. Yeah 100% and that's again you have to you have to be conscious of who you're targeting and that's why people say in the social media world niche down and a lot of times the thought is like well I don't want to isolate myself from people like I don't want somebody who's like who wants to live in Culver City to see my Burbank content right apparently we're all a whole LA geography show now. But you know I don't want somebody to see my content and then think oh they only help people in Burbank but the the misstep there is that your content only really has a shot to be competitive if you can really be niche and stand out because otherwise you know something that you know Dwayne the Rock Johnson Post is going to be next and forget about the other agents in your right it's going to be people it's going to be these crazy people spending millions of dollars making content like Mr. Beaster or millions of other folks. So I want to work with people who want to live in Burbank let's talk about the specifics in Burbank and also what maybe somebody needs to know if they're ready to buy or sell so that when I get in front of the people who are ready to buy or sell algorithmically they should be more likely to see my content and when they do they say wow this person is explaining my exact scenario right now why would I not work with them. Now let's let's talk about if we do have a question of a niche down question that we're trying to answer for via social media maybe it's why should I why should I live in Burbank or what are the reasons that people choose to live in Burbank and let's say we're going down that path. How do we determine sort of how long a video should be let's talk about length and you know frequency so if we want to do it now again you could make a million different videos about living in Burbank do you recommend making longer form of videos where we address many questions or shorter form videos that address just one question and then making more videos you know for each question has its own video. Yeah it's a great it's a great question and I think a lot of times people think hey I want to take like a longer form content because then I can cut it down into a lot of short form content that from a efficiency perspective in terms of editing makes perfect sense especially if you already have an audience but for a lot of folks their content they might not know what really works yet and that's where testing is so important and I would say test with not only the content that's easier to make that you can make more of so you can make more of it. You can make more tests and get a better result but also just the thing that tests better is short form content the reason for that is pure short form video content to be specific the reason for that is because one video is just it's the best way to communicate a brand just because you're taking care of all the sensory elements that we can actually use. But then also it's just it's the fastest way to transfer authenticity and on top of that there's a huge algorithm benefit to it right everyone's competing to be the short form platform right now and so when you do that it's easier to get tests and the reason why you'll get like three to one or four to one or five to one views on a short form versus a long form is because it's less of a commitment right I think a lot of times we make content for people we think well this is valuable information therefore it's valuable content but we actually have to take a step into the process of the content. So I'm going to step back and say okay well what's the most precious commodity or precious resource that anybody has which is time and when somebody pays attention to your content they're paying in their time and so when we think about it from that approach you're saying hey I'm asking this person to watch my video over scrolling and immediately finding something that will be infinitely valuable and entertaining to them I'm asking them to spend their time their limited time they'll never get back on my content when we think about it from that perspective it may be a lot of things that I'm going to do is I'm going to do that. It's really far easier to understand why content doesn't take off when we just kind of you know maybe put it out there with no strategy so I recommend take a lot of time to test make short form video content because it's easy to produce I just just do it with your iPhone don't don't spend a bunch of money on a whole studio until you start to find okay well these topics these really work and as long as that of course is relevant to our brand then let's start investing in doubling down into maybe long form or maybe podcasts or things like that when we know it's a topic that resonates with the right folks. So a question about posting is that yeah so start with short form eventually you can just because you can do them more efficiently more efficiently certainly and my question is how do you measure the effectiveness of a short form video. Yeah so there's a couple of key KPIs you know keep performance indicators that I think make the most sense for folks and so you have reach which is the number of individuals your content gets in front of if you go if you post on Facebook or Instagram you should you hopefully you're doing this with a business account I highly recommend it. A lot of people use personal accounts you can it's just it's hard to attract this information so that's why the benefit of the business account it exists. So if you make a business page and you make like a Instagram account and you attach it to your Facebook and all that annoying hoops hoops that they make you jump through when you go into your insights tab or you go into meta meta business dot Facebook dot com which will open up what's called meta business suite apologize that Facebook makes everything super difficult but they do they sure do. It's when I was there I was like why are you making it so tough for people to use your stuff and to give you their money because the ads platform is nuts. It's so complex I'm like this is so counterintuitive but anyway if you go through it and you make like a meta business suite account which should be fairly easy you might already have one not even know it you can track all of your results here and the main KPIs I would focus on is reach that should be your bread and butter in the beginning because again if we're putting it in the beginning and we're putting out organic content we can market for the most part especially if we're staying on brand and not just making crazy trend videos because we think it might go viral. If we're talking about the stuff that is on brand for us as a business as a real estate agent then we should know our reach is going to be getting in front of people because it's registering with what they want to see. So reach is probably the biggest one impressions people get the two mixed up reaches the number of individuals your content gets in front of impressions are the number of times like your video for instance has been seen all together. So let's say five people you reach five people hopefully way more than that and you get 10 impressions it's every person saw probably two times basically that's how that works out. So the reach is really the most important thing but you also have things like you know of course click through rate if you have content that clicks through depending on the platform that will show you really high levels of intent. But I wouldn't focus too much on things like likes and comments just because people can love content and not comment on it. I don't comment on anything. Well this is this is a podcast we net not shouldn't say never rarely do we I mean we do get we do get our listener feedback we get them in the way of people leave reviews or the email us but 99.99% of our listeners have never reached out to us or done any sort of engagement other than download a listen to the episode. Yeah and you know what I have I'm working with the real estate agent in Florida they had an amazing story I'm so glad they shared it they said um they started making YouTube's kind of their platform they started making YouTube videos for a long time for like years. They had a I believe it was a listing agent reach out to them and they said hey you know you're representing Lisa on this home purchase right I don't remember the name let's say it was Lisa. They said I don't know who this person is they said oh that they said that you're their agent turns out a viewer of this person's content had been watching them for so long they called up about a house and then when they asked what was the agent they just named the agent that they've been watching forever. Which is so funny and kind of a perfect scenario for any real estate agent out there right that's the dream right there but they have no idea because it's not like this person DM them or commented or anything it just goes to show the power of views is really strong there regardless of if they hit the like button or even the subscribe button or the follow button. And it's because they're people are wired for connection and through social media we're looking for people to relate to to connect with we're looking for problems to be solved but it's all interpersonal right so we have to think about these social media is this interpersonal exchange and to really think about how do I service how do I service the people with with this content. So okay, so we talked about the metrics of looking at reaches is most important how just just as a general example how often do you think someone should be making video content and posted yeah I mean honestly. The only hesitation I have about should is because everyone is different right and for instance like let's say let's say you have an amazing strategy of I don't know cold emailing let's say you get a ton of business from that social media I'm obviously I'm biased toward it but it's just one marketing sure like so I would I would be wrong to say like hey take time away from this amazing cold email strategy that's getting you business and throw it into testing the waters and so. And I'm not sure if you're going to do social media but what I will say is that ideally I would make a video once per day not actually because of algorithmically they're being some secret there but just because if you do anything once a day for long enough a it's not that hard to do especially if you just fill it with your phone talk about things that you already know about I mean you can make content really in 60 seconds and post it pretty much immediately. It's not much of a lift everyone has time for that and if you do that every day for a month you're going to build a habit and once you build that habit it's not like oh man I got to jump through these hoops to make the social media content it'll be second nature to you so I would recommend that if you're brand new honestly at the end of the day really the more content the better the only thing I'll say is that one platform I've seen a little issue with is I wouldn't post more than like two times a day to Instagram tends to have a lot of things that I'm going to do. I'm not going to post negative results but for the most part the more content you have the more people you'll get in front of but also the more information you'll have which makes you make better choices and build a stronger strategy and it becomes very difficult to fail when you have that much information and data on your side. We should also mention too that that's strictly the the act of doing this exercise daily making a short form video each day I remember reading a book by the person who mentored Mr. Beast it was an analytics guy and Mr. Beast basically said assume your first hundred videos are going to be just terrible. He says don't worry about it they're going to be and once you're done with them you'll look back on them and you'll know what I mean but he said but the good news is you're going to get better at it every single time so that I think is also something that agents can forget is they post some videos they don't have the whatever metric they're looking for the result isn't there the engagement isn't there they didn't get phone calls there are likes there were comments and there's if they're still developing their skill set and they're still continuing to try to do it. If they try to improve then ultimately you know if you if they just keep going down the path they are going to get better at it and if they're looking at their their their analytics they're going to know what's working and what isn't and if they hire somebody like you you can actually help them figure all of this out. Yeah that's that's exactly right it's really like one of my favorite quotes and I apply it to marketing though it applied to to military before was just that was a Napoleon quote I oh my god now I'm forgetting it's it's something along the lines of you know like volume is a essentially a benefit in and of itself right I'm butchering the quote but essentially it's that you know we talk about like oh what should I be wearing like what kind of light should I use what kind of light should I use. So I can do something like that kind of microphone should I use and we do that but like the power of just doing something over and over again no matter what your starting point is is truly the biggest compounding vehicle. It's if you do something a hundred times like in the the Mr. Beast example eventually you will suck so little you will actually be good. Right it's not about even getting good it's about sucking less yeah yeah but eventually it's it is a spectrum it's not like you're good or bad it's how good are you and so eventually you will be you will be so bad. If you're not being bad you'll actually be good and that's one of my that's one of my favorite quotes when it comes to content creation. And we could we could get into deeper conversations about the sort of the nature of content whether it's a content that's disposable or content that sticks around YouTube is more of a stick around you know it's a search engine so it's a repository it is I like to think of it as it's well I think AI is now taking over this this mantle but prior to AI being accessible to to the rest of us. Was this was like our Oracle at Delphi this was our answer Google and and YouTube were our answers you know we are this was what we said you know mysteries of the universe and they will they will give us those answers and now you know this when we have content that people will we call evergreen that they'll you know content that can kind of live indefinitely because it's applicable all the time you know then you could put some of that content on some of those more repository. So you know it's like a really good video on a particular neighborhood in Syracuse that people are searching to learn about well that might serve me for years and years I mean maybe I'll have to update it at some point but it will serve me while I'm sleeping it will be there whereas it fits on Instagram or Facebook. It tends to be more disposable people aren't you know I mean they could look at you know your previous posts and they they could find it. But it's not Facebook and Instagram really aren't search engines I mean technically they are but it's not really how people use them right yeah and that's that's a great way to put it to a set there is a massive power of evergreen content when we work with real estate agents we try and make content topics that are almost exclusively evergreen for that very reason. That being said and you are 100% right that the evergreen aspect of content on platforms like YouTube are far stronger but I will I had a funny instance where a actually too funny instances from one client who actually happened to be before we really dived into just working primarily with real estate agents. We had we were working with a wine company we actually still are but they created a video which is how to use like a wine opener right this electric wine opener they put it up on YouTube years ago five six years ago before I ever met any of them. To this day every year that video accounts for probably 90% of their total views because every year on December 25th everyone opens up that Corvin wine opener brand and they don't know how to use it and gets what's the go to video of how to use it yeah this video this guy made five years ago. Which is so funny but yeah and another funny note though too is that generally there is more short term aspect on platforms like Instagram especially. We had a video that like I was looking at for a client the other day that was going I was going through I saw a bunch of likes coming on like oh man they really like the new piece of content is a video from two weeks ago that's still researching just because it was it was some user generated content people really liked it was funny and that kind of took off but. It is very funny I do recommend people if you really want to benefit from content as much as possible evergreen will serve you the best just because you you're giving your chance yourself a longer horizon for people to discover it and get value from it now tell me tell us about Jarvis media what do you do specifically for real estate agents. Yeah so appreciate that our our main focus is again giving really tangible results for people without having to you know become a content creator and so we do this a lot of ways what we ultimately really have kind of found a nation is creating hybrid content what I mean by that as hybrid between. Organic and paid the reason for this is because if you're real estate agent you have very limited time you have to make content you know to to be relevant on social media but your time has a monetary value itself so for agents who are at a certain level we find hey let's make the best piece of organic content we possibly can and then implement a really minor very like a scrappy paid budget with it as well that not only helps us get in front of more people but. Target more specifically to which we can't do as much on the organic side so we've built our whole model out of having agents come on we do a one hour a month call with them we get a whole months worth of content and then we edit at all deliver all the content to all their platforms so that they can focus on what they're best at which is being an awesome agent. So let me make sure I understand so the idea is you know make make a really great piece of content and then possibly. Because it's somewhat disposable on Facebook Instagram what we'll use a paid campaign to redirect attention back to that content is that my understanding yeah we'll squeeze that organic orange for as much as it's worth and then implement that in a paid strategy which allows us to. Target again more specifically and test more accurately because then you start to get out of the weeds of like well maybe Tuesday more people saw than Wednesday you start to really get a much clearer representation of the content that resonates when you're able to a be test so perfectly with ads and that's how we help to make content that just gets better and better month over month and again the time savings is really what people care about this hey how can I work with you and just do one hour a month. You help me make the content and then I can just focus on the other aspects of my business that are super important. Yeah I love that if anyone is interested in working with Cole and he has had some unbelievable results remember he worked at Tik Tok and Facebook he knows how the sauces made and he or the how the sausages made we sit we would say in Chicago but. But certainly he is there's nothing more frustrating than creating a wonderful a good piece of content that we know is good but because we don't have the right strategy to distribute it out to the it's not that necessarily the audience rejected the content they might not have seen it and and this is something that happens with just listed in just sold you know post all the time is somebody says hey I just did this cool thing and here here's a. You're a picture of it and they don't get a lot of likes and they're like oh I guess people weren't happy for me no it's that that Facebook probably knows that that's not a super engaging post because it's just basically an advertisement for yourself or about or a little congratulatory thing they understand that's pretty disposable and doesn't really help their platform all that much so they're going to push that content down and they want something that really grips somebody and once you know you don't want to keep them on so the ideas you might create this great content but you don't exactly know how to put it on the market.
