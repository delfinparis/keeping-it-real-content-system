[00:03:38] at the NAR conference this fall, along with many other conferences. Chris, welcome to the show.
[00:03:43] DJ, great to see you. Thanks for having me back. Great. What are we talking about this week?
[00:03:48] Oh, man. What are we talking about? I mean, we could talk about a number of different things,
[00:03:53] but the biggest, most important, most impactful topic that is making the rounds through real estate
[00:04:00] circles right now is clear cooperation. Clear cooperation is the topic that we need to discuss.
[00:04:07] I suspect a lot of agents, this might be a topic that is a little bit under the radar with the
[00:04:14] NAR compensation settlement, the lawsuit that really got most of the press, but this is actually
[00:04:21] a rule that went that NAR adopted in 2019. I suspect a lot of our audience probably has never
[00:04:29] heard of clear cooperation or really fully understand it. So maybe we should first define
[00:04:33] what this rule is and who it benefits. You betcha. No, I want to be the first to say, you might not
[00:04:41] know the name clear cooperation, but if you have been operating in the real estate space in the
[00:04:46] last five years, you know what this is because somebody has mentioned this rule to you, even if they
[00:04:54] haven't done so by name, right? So here's what clear cooperation is in a nutshell. There's a number
[00:05:00] of different bullet points here, but I'm going to distill it down chat GPT style to just do a
[00:05:04] couple of sentences for everybody. Okay, clear cooperation is the requirement that real estate
[00:05:10] professionals list a property on the MLS within 24 hours of the commencement of marketing of this
[00:05:22] property. So if you start marketing a property anywhere, whether it's on Facebook, whether it's
[00:05:31] on your website, whether it is a sign in the ground in front of the property, it has to be in the
[00:05:40] MLS within 24 hours of that marketing commencing. And this is again, there are some nuances to it,
[00:05:51] but in a nutshell, this is what this is all about. And if you didn't know this policy by name,
[00:05:57] you have heard this requirement from your managing broker, you've heard it from your team leaders,
[00:06:05] it's got to get in the MLS within 24 hours of getting the sign in the ground. This is the policy
[00:06:13] that caused all the kerfluffle around coming soon posts on social media.
[00:06:21] Even remember like five years ago, this was a really big deal. Are coming soon legal? Can we do
[00:06:26] coming soon? Is this something that's fair? Clear cooperation is what happened following a
[00:06:33] couple of different things, including all the controversy around coming soon.
[00:06:38] So I guess we should talk about currently who's, well, let's talk about the pros and cons.
[00:06:43] So what are the pros of this particular, well, first of all, we should mention this is only,
[00:06:49] I believe, enforced for brokerages and agents at the brokerage who are members of NAR. If you're not
[00:06:56] a member of NAR, I suspect this wouldn't apply, but I would think 99% of our listeners are probably
[00:07:03] members of NAR. So at present, this applies to almost everyone we're probably reaching.
[00:07:08] Yeah, it's important to note, this is not a law in the United States or anywhere. This is not
[00:07:14] a regulation from any state government. This is a rule, a policy from the National Association of
[00:07:24] REALTORS. So when it comes to enforcement here, I know police officers knocking on your office
[00:07:32] door saying, Hey, I noticed there was a sign in the yard of 123 Main Street two days ago, and I
[00:07:38] don't see it on the local MLS. What's the deal? That's not happening. This is a policy from the
[00:07:44] National Association of REALTORS. But the reason why this is such an impactful policy is the National
[00:07:53] Association of REALTORS is the owner of or owns a partially controlling stake in nine out of every 10
[00:08:03] MLSs across the country. So the policy is one that is set by this professional organization, but is
[00:08:12] often enforced by the mechanism that most real estate professionals use to execute their business.
[00:08:19] So there is a lot of interplay, many, many layers here, into how this policy is enforced and by whom.
[00:08:32] And it's a little complicated sometimes. So let's discuss the pros from the perspective of
[00:08:38] the National Association of REALTORS. Of course, we are not speaking for NAR, but we are sort of
[00:08:43] understanding maybe why this they've adopted this back in 2019. The first reason, which probably is
[00:08:51] the most obvious reason that certainly occurred to me, was this, well, basically streamlines a process
[00:08:58] of listing to where they could say, Hey, you know, if we allowed agents to list outside of the MLS
[00:09:06] other places than the MLS, then it really is going to be difficult for the public to really get a
[00:09:12] sense of where all the listings are available for sale and really doing this in the in the aim of
[00:09:17] the public good. We want like one system where people could see every just about everything. And
[00:09:22] that to me is seems to become sort of an equity thing. Like can we make sure that there's one spot
[00:09:29] that since since the MLS is largely a public facing site, you know, we have one spot where people
[00:09:37] can go and really see just about everything. That's yeah, that's that's that's correct. I think I'll
[00:09:43] add a couple of layers of complexity to that that diagnosis as well. There is a kind of a perspective
[00:09:53] here that if we don't have a centralized location where all available properties can be accessed or
[00:10:05] dispersed from, then we develop systems that are not equitable to professionals and not equitable to
[00:10:17] consumers. So for instance, think about think about a market like a hypothetical market. If we didn't
[00:10:27] according to the National Association of Builders, if we didn't have a clear cooperation policy,
[00:10:32] what would emerge is different REALTORS with various levels of pocket listings that are inaccessible to
[00:10:44] their colleagues. You would have an inconsistent amount of time in a coming soon status such that
[00:10:55] markets become unpredictable. You can have somebody who lists a coming soon a month before a
[00:11:01] property goes live and it creates an unpredictable consumer expectation for when a property might
[00:11:12] actually be available. And it also creates a level of difficulty for anyone who is trying to
[00:11:23] comp the existing market because if I'm an appraiser or even if I'm a REALTOR who's trying to do a
[00:11:31] pricing CNA, if there are properties that are for sale but are not listed or if there are properties
[00:11:40] that are coming soon but not technically available because they're not technically in their listing
[00:11:46] period, how do I account for these either mystery like blank pricing comps when it comes to pockets
[00:11:57] or to these hypothetical listings? Like I can list a property for 10 times its market value in coming
[00:12:04] soon and there's no there's actually there's no way to measure the market's response to it because
[00:12:10] the property's not technically available. So the National Association of REALTORS has you know said
[00:12:17] these are the reasons why clear cooperation is an important policy to have in place.
[00:12:24] Whether or not that is actually the reason the National Association of REALTORS put this in place
[00:12:31] is another question. I do want to get into that. I mean I don't want to get into a road of
[00:12:38] hearsay but there is another side to that story too. Yeah let's let's hear it because basically what
[00:12:45] we're talking about is having a centralized location where we can where not only can everything be
[00:12:53] organized but we can hold the agents within that that container accountable for various practices
[00:13:02] and compliance you know sort of enforcement such that we're all kind of playing within the same
[00:13:11] rules if we're allowing external listings or outside non-MLS listings listings on other exchanges
[00:13:20] there really opens up a lot of sort of how now how do we measure those listings versus
[00:13:26] MLS listings it just becomes a much more difficult way to sort of compare and contrast value and
[00:13:33] really just organizing data is really kind of what it boils down to it's tougher to organize
[00:13:38] all of that data and present it to the public. That is true but let me provide to you another
[00:13:45] another element a pretty important one from the National Association of REALTORS Code of Ethics
[00:13:52] which is our first responsibility to as REALTORS is to our clients it is not to the community
[00:14:02] right our first responsibility is not to is not to frankly it is not to organize a a marketplace where
[00:14:12] data collection is easy our first responsibility as real estate professionals is to the
[00:14:20] is to maximize the fiduciary opportunities of our buyers and sellers and there is a very I frankly
[00:14:30] cannot see a world in which a mandatory requirement for listing in a particular place in a particular
[00:14:43] time frame can can I just do not see a world where that sort of system squares with I'm going to do
[00:14:55] everything that I can in the best interest of my clients not everyone else's clients just mine because
[00:15:01] here's the reality DJ the best interests of my client might be to keep this listing a private listing
[00:15:09] that I only advertise in my local circles because they don't want it exposed to the other
[00:15:18] to the rest of the MLS sure for one-levardies athletes people who are in the public sphere likely don't
[00:15:26] want lucky lose coming in just because they know they live there there's a that's that's a great
[00:15:31] example but honestly and I'm not I'm not calling you out on this but frankly like that particular
[00:15:37] example I think is tired to me right it's it's it's it's extreme example that only applies
[00:15:44] it's rarely like one-tenth of one-tenth of one percent of of listings in the United States would qualify
[00:15:52] for that sure are you selling Rihanna's house DJ if you're selling Rihanna's house you've got to
[00:15:58] tell us right now okay let's say sadly she's not picking up my call okay well I'll tell her to
[00:16:05] talk but here's here's the reality you don't have to be Rihanna for there to be a clear opportunity
[00:16:15] for a non MLS required listing strategy to benefit you let me give you a great example
[00:16:21] I own a house on one two three main street that I love somebody down the street is selling their
[00:16:31] house for way more than I thought my house was was was worth I don't have any reason to move from one
[00:16:41] to three main street but the REALTOR who's listing that house down the street for $200,000 more
[00:16:47] than I thought they they would get they come by and they say you know listing four five six main
[00:16:55] street I know it's above market but we've got some legitimate reasons to believe that they they
[00:17:01] they might get this price are you interested in just testing the waters maybe you don't want to put
[00:17:06] your house up for sale but how would you feel if the buyers for that came through one two three main
[00:17:13] street would you like me to say by the excuse me the buyers that came through four five six main
[00:17:18] street how would you like me would you would you like me to say hey you know if this house doesn't
[00:17:22] work for you one two three main street down the road they might be interested in selling here's
[00:17:27] their price in order to do that legally you need a listing contract in order to have that opportunity
[00:17:37] to market a property privately to a group of individual to a group of people clear cooperation
[00:17:45] says that property's got to be on the MLS that is a that does not require a Rihanna level
[00:17:54] home sale for clear cooperation to not make sense to my clients because it isn't about servicing
[00:18:03] the community as as as backwards as that sounds and as as contrary to what my message all the time
[00:18:12] is to people is that our responsibility as real tours is to be the mouthpiece and advocates for
[00:18:19] our communities because nobody knows housing in our communities better than the real estate professionals
[00:18:25] but in this instance we are not wearing that hat clear cooperation is a conversation where we are
[00:18:32] wearing our client advocacy hats only and honestly the problem here is that clear cooperation
[00:18:40] as it stands right now is a blanket policy with no exceptions there are there are no ways to wiggle
[00:18:48] in and out of that and it is frankly it just doesn't make sense in the context of being
[00:18:57] our first responsibility to be to our clients I have a friend who two or three years ago this is
[00:19:04] pre-settlement had a seven million dollar buyer and or rather yes she had a buyer and there was a
[00:19:14] listing that that that was what the buyer wanted the seller pulls out last minute while turns out
[00:19:20] right next door to that listing is another seven million dollar property and the agent walked to
[00:19:25] the to over next door and said hey this your next door neighbor bailed out on this but this
[00:19:29] property is perfect for my buyer that he's going to buy something if I can get you this price
[00:19:34] what do you think and the person's like I don't want it on the I don't want to list it but if you
[00:19:39] can get me that price we'll sell it so there's exact same example again that's a seven million dollar
[00:19:44] listing obviously that's that's an unusual price listing for for most of us but that is exactly the
[00:19:50] same example you shared and they she was able to get the deal closed and I think she probably did
[00:19:55] have to list it for for one day to sell it but she they ideally they would have it would have been a
[00:20:01] private sale of sorts yep so this is you bring up a great point this that's a fantastic example
[00:20:07] to talk about how the existing system has has kind of a a jagged and uncoordinated connection
[00:20:22] to this idea of created sales created sales and off market sales these are venn diagrams with a
[00:20:32] ton of overlap and what we wind up doing because of the restrictions of clear cooperation we wind
[00:20:41] up having to cobble together these created sales where there's some guesswork that is involved
[00:20:52] because we just can't do what is in the best interest of our clients by virtue of the restrictions
[00:20:58] of clear cooperation now I I want to stop for just a second and say I'm it sounds like I'm ragging
[00:21:07] a lot on clear cooperation and I am I mean let's call a spade a spade here but there are elements
[00:21:16] of what clear cooperation is shooting for that I think are important for instance I do think
[00:21:25] it is important for professionals in a community to have a clear picture of what the property
[00:21:35] in a community is worth by virtue of an organized system of comps I think that clear cooperation
[00:21:45] targets this but does so in kind of an unfocused way if I was rewriting the policies and and I
[00:21:53] are your listening call me if I was rewriting the policy I would rewrite it to say the policy
[00:22:02] does not require the listing but it does require the reporting of sales right so such like
[00:22:09] go ahead I'm sorry we know afterwards like after after a sale is closed there is a there is a
[00:22:17] responsibility to report sales to the MLS that can be listed post transaction does that make sense
[00:22:25] yep I think it is valid to point out here that one of the reasons in my opinion and granted
[00:22:36] this is a little unpopular right now but you know that's the title of show here so that's okay
[00:22:42] one of the reasons why this this this conversation is so fervent right now and frankly why I expect
[00:22:52] I will not be surprised if there isn't some pretty dramatic announcements and conversations from
[00:22:59] the NAR before the conference in Boston this November one of the reasons why I think there's
[00:23:06] so much momentum here is that following the compensation lawsuit settlements there has been a
[00:23:14] a an appropriate re emphasis and now laser focus on the development of individualized value and
[00:23:27] brand differentiation in in in the real estate community the fact that buyer comp is no longer a
[00:23:34] a like a virtual guarantee the fact that buyers have to actually excuse me buyers agents have to
[00:23:40] actually prove that they are worthy of the of the commission that they are getting it's not a
[00:23:47] guarantee written into the listing agreement any longer it is putting into stark re out a stark
[00:23:55] contrast the fact that your it's not just your brand and your differentiated value in terms of your
[00:24:05] skill set and experience that matters if clear cooperation goes away you know what else gets added
[00:24:11] to this list it's your connections it's your ability to source the off market properties or the
[00:24:21] privately listed properties that other agents can't see and this is where the idea of private listing
[00:24:29] networks walled gardens that are not the MLS but do contain properties that are for sale this is where
[00:24:37] a real estate professional can really leverage their connection to their community because those
[00:24:45] those agents who can leverage that connection to their community and demonstrate that they have
[00:24:50] access to all of the property that's for sale even the most exclusive even the the non traditionally
[00:24:57] listed property those are agents that are going to be much more valuable and and be able to
[00:25:03] differentiate themselves much more strongly than the agents who are just kind of sitting back refreshing
[00:25:10] Zillow waiting to see what's online we should mention too that NAR created with their own admission
[00:25:19] created this policy at and one of the objectives was to stem the private listing network stem the
[00:25:30] the growth of the private listing network you know I again NAR is thinking in terms of equality
[00:25:36] they want people to have access to the same database so that you know they they can make a good case
[00:25:41] why it's why why their existence is so important to consumers is they're like we want to make
[00:25:46] this a level playing field where you have access to everything and we should also mention that in
[00:25:51] the last week maybe week and a half two major brokerages have come out in against this policy
[00:26:00] just today or yesterday anywhere one of the largest real estate companies in the world certainly
[00:26:05] in this country the United States they have most of the big brands that that we know big brokerages
[00:26:11] they said they were would like to push NAR to abandon the policy
[00:26:15] Robert Reffkin would Compass did this a week ago basically said the same thing
[00:26:19] and that's just the first two brokerages to sort of sound off on it because in their perspective
[00:26:24] I believe is we don't NAR we don't need you to tell us where these listings need to be marketed
[00:26:31] we we are fiduciaries we are going to operate in our clients best interest and maybe that's the
[00:26:37] MLS maybe it isn't but we need to be able to make that choice for our agents for our clients
[00:26:42] yeah and like let's be clear I have a feeling there are some folks even if you work for an
[00:26:49] anywhere brand you don't know anywhere is the brand that represents Codal banker Century 21 ERA
[00:26:58] better homes and gardens better homes and gardens souther bees corkren I mean these are like
[00:27:04] these are the major brands the the major franchise brands in the United States
[00:27:12] and and honestly there is an interesting set of motivations here but I do want to come back to
[00:27:23] an interesting point that I kind of made off handedly earlier there are some real estate brands
[00:27:31] that are pushing against this Glenn Kalman of Redfin is pushing against this there's a handful
[00:27:42] of places but you know who's really pushing against this is Zillow and the major reason why is
[00:27:51] and again Zillow your list name call me I got I got some great advice for you here
[00:27:55] um the major reason Zillow is pushing hard against this is that their business is built on the idea
[00:28:03] that they're going to get all the listings by virtue whoops and knocking stuff over on my desk I'm
[00:28:09] so excited about this Zillow Zillow's business is built on the fact that they have unfettered access
[00:28:15] to all of the properties that are getting listed for sale by virtue of their relationships with
[00:28:20] these MLS's I mean think about all of the ways that Zillow gets data it is all of these IDX
[00:28:28] relationships with brokerages if if clear cooperation when a way or excuse me not with brokerages
[00:28:33] with MLS's if clear cooperation went away and let's say um let's just be conservative here
[00:28:42] let's say 5% of listings left the MLS's were never listed on the MLS's it doesn't seem like very much
[00:28:52] but I want you to think about for a moment the amount of traffic that Zillow drives annually even
[00:29:01] it's it's an extraordinary number there is a not insignificant percentage of that traffic
[00:29:07] that is driven by consumers who actually don't have any purpose they're they're not looking to
[00:29:15] actually buy they're looking to use that portal to essentially house surf they're looking for the
[00:29:25] most outrageous and beautiful listings because they just like looking at houses the biggest the most
[00:29:32] expensive the most the craziest they want to see the most exclusive listings in their communities
[00:29:39] or in communities they don't live in those are going to be the first listings that will leave Zillow
[00:29:45] it is the it's the the most expensive house in your community is the most likely one to take
[00:29:52] advantage of an exclusive private listing network or not be listed on the MLS at all that is
[00:29:59] going to have a measurable effect on the traffic of Zillow and if agents start to find success listing
[00:30:10] properties other than the on places other than the MLS there will be a snowball that will start
[00:30:17] rolling away from Zillow in terms of the amount of properties that are on that site it right now
[00:30:23] is like a de facto national MLS right that won't be the case we are going to move to a place
[00:30:31] where instead of having one national MLS by via by virtue of Zillow we are going to have
[00:30:40] a hundred small walled gardens across the United States that are these private listing networks
[00:30:46] that are specific to property type to buyer type that are specific to a you know seller scenarios
[00:30:55] like kind of the name your price you know like like sellers who are like you know make me sell
[00:31:01] kind of thing like if I can get the right price I'll sell but otherwise I'm not listing or sellers
[00:31:06] that are saying I'm interested in selling my home but I don't want to look
[00:31:12] positive to the full market I don't want everybody seen in my living room that sort of thing that
[00:31:17] happens Zillow is going to have to pivot it's anymore or they're going to have to build relationships
[00:31:23] with each of those other listing exchanges and marketplaces and somehow coordinate all of that
[00:31:30] and we should mention too that yes agents tend to you know a lot of agents tend to think unfavorably
[00:31:36] about Zillow and whatever your personal feelings are about Zillow they touch something like 90 plus
[00:31:43] percent of all residential real estate transactions and some portion literally almost everyone is on
[00:31:50] Zillow at some point the transaction so yes we could all root for Zillow we can root for Zillow to fail
[00:31:56] as a company because of our personal feelings but is that also in the in the public's good for Zillow
[00:32:02] to fail I don't know because if it's touching we really we really now are back to sort of what's
[00:32:09] in the best interest of the public is it better to have 10 grocery stores in town that all have some
[00:32:15] of the same stuff but have unique items in each grocery store or is it better to have one grocery
[00:32:21] store well that's a debatable topic right it's a great question I will say this I'm going to make
[00:32:27] a prediction it's probably unpopular with some folks but if it comes down to a clear cooperation
[00:32:33] policy disappearing and in order for Zillow to continue to be effective they have to make relationships
[00:32:39] with these individual private listing networks if that is what is required it's not going to happen
[00:32:46] because Zillow's relationships were not built with agents they were built with the MLSS that Zillow
[00:32:54] I mean and who owns 90% of the MLSS it's the National Association of REALTORS Zillow is a partner with
[00:33:00] the NAR that not with the individual members the individual members didn't sign up for that
[00:33:09] partnership and we have if this all comes comes comes to pass we have a rare instance where we can
[00:33:17] literally get a do over here agents can say knowing what I know now about how my relationship has
[00:33:26] been with this platform in the last 15 years will I willingly re-enter into this relationship with
[00:33:34] them I got to say I don't think that they will say yes I don't believe that agents will sign up
[00:33:42] for that again what do you think if you could wave a magic wand and create a policy or a non-policy
[00:33:49] around clear cooperation what what what do you think would be in in the best and highest good of
[00:33:55] everyone if I was setting the policy clear cooperation as a as a rule would go away
[00:34:05] there would be no requirement to market properties actively on the MLS there would be a
[00:34:12] requirement to report sales to the MLS and in instances where sellers don't want to list on
[00:34:22] the MLS for privacy concerns there would be a a box for anonymizing listings such that we have the
[00:34:31] data without the address if that makes sense like we have the listing data but I can't tie it back
[00:34:37] to a particular transaction the other thing I would say if I was magic waving a magic wand and
[00:34:45] resetting policy I would first of all I wouldn't set policy at the with a trade group I would
[00:34:54] uh I would create uh probably regulation in the United States that says here are the ground rules
[00:35:04] for listing property and tie it to fair housing like we have we already have these these principles
[00:35:12] in place these foundations of discrimination in place you may advertise your property as long as you
[00:35:19] violate the laws of the United States we already do this when it comes to rental properties um
[00:35:26] rental properties can be advertised in a hundred different ways they are not required to be on the MLS
[00:35:33] we just can't advertise them in ways that break fair housing rules it makes perfect sense that
[00:35:39] that's the direction we would go with sales too well I very interested to see what will happen again
[00:35:47] this this really speaks a lot to brokerages continuing their NAR memberships the MLS and
[00:35:54] and the rare their relationship to national association and just again what's always in the best
[00:36:01] public interest and the best fiduciary interest of the customer and it is a really thorny issue
[00:36:07] because there there isn't a clear and obvious solution to this that is clean um but there's certainly
[00:36:16] certainly more conversations to have I I would love to we rarely ask for feedback but I would love
[00:36:23] to know what our audience thinks would be in their client's best interest would you prefer
[00:36:28] to have a decentralized essentially MLS where people could post on different exchanges and you would
[00:36:35] just have to be aware of those different exchanges and maybe you'd have access to someone not others
[00:36:39] or would you would you like to see everything in one location I'd be very curious from the agent level
[00:36:44] what they think would be most effective for them and so please let us know Chris if I would love
[00:36:51] people to to really chime in on this one what would be the best way for somebody to give you
[00:36:56] their opinion if they had a specific thought about this yeah I would you can do two things one
[00:37:04] connect with me on LinkedIn I love I love conversations on LinkedIn I post there every day
[00:37:09] come on over follow me on LinkedIn comment on a post send me a DM I love to hear from folks
[00:37:16] too you can find me on Instagram coach chryslyn sell pretty straight forward that's that's an
[00:37:23] easy place to get a hold of me as well um and yeah share your feedback here this is definitely a
[00:37:29] conversation that is going to continue to evolve um and I want to make it totally clear I think
[00:37:35] that the MLS is in itself a good thing I don't think a requirement from a man let me just say this
[00:37:48] like I like the National Association of REALTORS I believe in its purpose and its value I'm speaking
[00:37:55] at their conference in Boston if you're listening and you're going to Boston this year for the NAR
[00:37:59] conference come see me I would love to hear what you have to say I also think that there is a
[00:38:06] inherent conflict of interest for a trade group that owns a portal to require people to use that
[00:38:15] portal with and and then also be able to say you know I want side of their mouth require them to
[00:38:21] use the portal and out of the other side of their mouth say well we are here to represent your
[00:38:26] best interests even if your best interests are to not post on the MLS just is there's there's
[00:38:33] cognitive dissonance that needs to be resolved by the removal of a requirement here yeah so whether
[00:38:39] you believe what I say whether you think I'm full of it I would love to hear from you find me on
[00:38:45] Instagram find me on LinkedIn or uh just message DJ personally and he can relay it to me I can
[00:38:51] relay it and also to sound off to your local association let them they work well they don't work
[00:38:57] for you necessarily but they are there to represent you so please let them know your thoughts because
[00:39:02] NAR does listen to the local associations were you know NAR is here in Chicago where I'm located
[00:39:08] and I can tell you for sure that they are their ears are open to what us local associations are
[00:39:15] wanting and needing also you know as it from a representative let you let the leaders in your
[00:39:19] community know what you would prefer Chris um great chatting with you again for everything Chris

What are we talking about this week? Oh, man. What are we talking about? I mean, we could talk about a number of different things, but the biggest, most important, most impactful topic that is making the rounds through real estate circles right now is clear cooperation. Clear cooperation is the topic that we need to discuss. I suspect a lot of agents, this might be a topic that is a little bit under the radar with the NAR compensation settlement, the lawsuit that really got most of the press, but this is actually a rule that went that NAR adopted in 2019. I suspect a lot of our audience probably has never heard of clear cooperation or really fully understand it. So maybe we should first define what this rule is and who it benefits. You betcha. No, I want to be the first to say, you might not know the name clear cooperation, but if you have been operating in the real estate space in the last five years, you know what this is because somebody has mentioned this rule to you, even if they haven't done so by name, right? So here's what clear cooperation is in a nutshell. There's a number of different bullet points here, but I'm going to distill it down chat GPT style to just do a couple of sentences for everybody. Okay, clear cooperation is the requirement that real estate professionals list a property on the MLS within 24 hours of the commencement of marketing of this property. So if you start marketing a property anywhere, whether it's on Facebook, whether it's on your website, whether it is a sign in the ground in front of the property, it has to be in the MLS within 24 hours of that marketing commencing. And this is again, there are some nuances to it, but in a nutshell, this is what this is all about. And if you didn't know this policy by name, you have heard this requirement from your managing broker, you've heard it from your team leaders, it's got to get in the MLS within 24 hours of getting the sign in the ground. This is the policy that caused all the kerfluffle around coming soon posts on social media. Even remember like five years ago, this was a really big deal. Are coming soon legal? Can we do coming soon? Is this something that's fair? Clear cooperation is what happened following a couple of different things, including all the controversy around coming soon. So I guess we should talk about currently who's, well, let's talk about the pros and cons. So what are the pros of this particular, well, first of all, we should mention this is only, I believe, enforced for brokerages and agents at the brokerage who are members of NAR. If you're not a member of NAR, I suspect this wouldn't apply, but I would think 99% of our listeners are probably members of NAR. So at present, this applies to almost everyone we're probably reaching. Yeah, it's important to note, this is not a law in the United States or anywhere. This is not a regulation from any state government. This is a rule, a policy from the National Association of REALTORS. So when it comes to enforcement here, I know police officers knocking on your office door saying, Hey, I noticed there was a sign in the yard of 123 Main Street two days ago, and I don't see it on the local MLS. What's the deal? That's not happening. This is a policy from the National Association of REALTORS. But the reason why this is such an impactful policy is the National Association of REALTORS is the owner of or owns a partially controlling stake in nine out of every 10 MLSs across the country. So the policy is one that is set by this professional organization, but is often enforced by the mechanism that most real estate professionals use to execute their business. So there is a lot of interplay, many, many layers here, into how this policy is enforced and by whom. And it's a little complicated sometimes. So let's discuss the pros from the perspective of the National Association of REALTORS. Of course, we are not speaking for NAR, but we are sort of understanding maybe why this they've adopted this back in 2019. The first reason, which probably is the most obvious reason that certainly occurred to me, was this, well, basically streamlines a process of listing to where they could say, Hey, you know, if we allowed agents to list outside of the MLS other places than the MLS, then it really is going to be difficult for the public to really get a sense of where all the listings are available for sale and really doing this in the in the aim of the public good. We want like one system where people could see every just about everything. And that to me is seems to become sort of an equity thing. Like can we make sure that there's one spot that since since the MLS is largely a public facing site, you know, we have one spot where people can go and really see just about everything. That's yeah, that's that's that's correct. I think I'll add a couple of layers of complexity to that that diagnosis as well. There is a kind of a perspective here that if we don't have a centralized location where all available properties can be accessed or dispersed from, then we develop systems that are not equitable to professionals and not equitable to consumers. So for instance, think about think about a market like a hypothetical market. If we didn't according to the National Association of Builders, if we didn't have a clear cooperation policy, what would emerge is different REALTORS with various levels of pocket listings that are inaccessible to their colleagues. You would have an inconsistent amount of time in a coming soon status such that markets become unpredictable. You can have somebody who lists a coming soon a month before a property goes live and it creates an unpredictable consumer expectation for when a property might actually be available. And it also creates a level of difficulty for anyone who is trying to comp the existing market because if I'm an appraiser or even if I'm a REALTOR who's trying to do a pricing CNA, if there are properties that are for sale but are not listed or if there are properties that are coming soon but not technically available because they're not technically in their listing period, how do I account for these either mystery like blank pricing comps when it comes to pockets or to these hypothetical listings? Like I can list a property for 10 times its market value in coming soon and there's no there's actually there's no way to measure the market's response to it because the property's not technically available. So the National Association of REALTORS has you know said these are the reasons why clear cooperation is an important policy to have in place. Whether or not that is actually the reason the National Association of REALTORS put this in place is another question. I do want to get into that. I mean I don't want to get into a road of hearsay but there is another side to that story too. Yeah let's let's hear it because basically what we're talking about is having a centralized location where we can where not only can everything be organized but we can hold the agents within that that container accountable for various practices and compliance you know sort of enforcement such that we're all kind of playing within the same rules if we're allowing external listings or outside non-MLS listings listings on other exchanges there really opens up a lot of sort of how now how do we measure those listings versus MLS listings it just becomes a much more difficult way to sort of compare and contrast value and really just organizing data is really kind of what it boils down to it's tougher to organize all of that data and present it to the public. That is true but let me provide to you another another element a pretty important one from the National Association of REALTORS Code of Ethics which is our first responsibility to as REALTORS is to our clients it is not to the community right our first responsibility is not to is not to frankly it is not to organize a a marketplace where data collection is easy our first responsibility as real estate professionals is to the is to maximize the fiduciary opportunities of our buyers and sellers and there is a very I frankly cannot see a world in which a mandatory requirement for listing in a particular place in a particular time frame can can I just do not see a world where that sort of system squares with I'm going to do everything that I can in the best interest of my clients not everyone else's clients just mine because here's the reality DJ the best interests of my client might be to keep this listing a private listing that I only advertise in my local circles because they don't want it exposed to the other to the rest of the MLS sure for one-levardies athletes people who are in the public sphere likely don't want lucky lose coming in just because they know they live there there's a that's that's a great example but honestly and I'm not I'm not calling you out on this but frankly like that particular example I think is tired to me right it's it's it's it's extreme example that only applies it's rarely like one-tenth of one-tenth of one percent of of listings in the United States would qualify for that sure are you selling Rihanna's house DJ if you're selling Rihanna's house you've got to tell us right now okay let's say sadly she's not picking up my call okay well I'll tell her to talk but here's here's the reality you don't have to be Rihanna for there to be a clear opportunity for a non MLS required listing strategy to benefit you let me give you a great example I own a house on one two three main street that I love somebody down the street is selling their house for way more than I thought my house was was was worth I don't have any reason to move from one to three main street but the REALTOR who's listing that house down the street for $200,000 more than I thought they they would get they come by and they say you know listing four five six main street I know it's above market but we've got some legitimate reasons to believe that they they they might get this price are you interested in just testing the waters maybe you don't want to put your house up for sale but how would you feel if the buyers for that came through one two three main street would you like me to say by the excuse me the buyers that came through four five six main street how would you like me would you would you like me to say hey you know if this house doesn't work for you one two three main street down the road they might be interested in selling here's their price in order to do that legally you need a listing contract in order to have that opportunity to market a property privately to a group of individual to a group of people clear cooperation says that property's got to be on the MLS that is a that does not require a Rihanna level home sale for clear cooperation to not make sense to my clients because it isn't about servicing the community as as as backwards as that sounds and as as contrary to what my message all the time is to people is that our responsibility as real tours is to be the mouthpiece and advocates for our communities because nobody knows housing in our communities better than the real estate professionals but in this instance we are not wearing that hat clear cooperation is a conversation where we are wearing our client advocacy hats only and honestly the problem here is that clear cooperation as it stands right now is a blanket policy with no exceptions there are there are no ways to wiggle in and out of that and it is frankly it just doesn't make sense in the context of being our first responsibility to be to our clients I have a friend who two or three years ago this is pre-settlement had a seven million dollar buyer and or rather yes she had a buyer and there was a listing that that that was what the buyer wanted the seller pulls out last minute while turns out right next door to that listing is another seven million dollar property and the agent walked to the to over next door and said hey this your next door neighbor bailed out on this but this property is perfect for my buyer that he's going to buy something if I can get you this price what do you think and the person's like I don't want it on the I don't want to list it but if you can get me that price we'll sell it so there's exact same example again that's a seven million dollar listing obviously that's that's an unusual price listing for for most of us but that is exactly the same example you shared and they she was able to get the deal closed and I think she probably did have to list it for for one day to sell it but she they ideally they would have it would have been a private sale of sorts yep so this is you bring up a great point this that's a fantastic example to talk about how the existing system has has kind of a a jagged and uncoordinated connection to this idea of created sales created sales and off market sales these are venn diagrams with a ton of overlap and what we wind up doing because of the restrictions of clear cooperation we wind up having to cobble together these created sales where there's some guesswork that is involved because we just can't do what is in the best interest of our clients by virtue of the restrictions of clear cooperation now I I want to stop for just a second and say I'm it sounds like I'm ragging a lot on clear cooperation and I am I mean let's call a spade a spade here but there are elements of what clear cooperation is shooting for that I think are important for instance I do think it is important for professionals in a community to have a clear picture of what the property in a community is worth by virtue of an organized system of comps I think that clear cooperation targets this but does so in kind of an unfocused way if I was rewriting the policies and and I are your listening call me if I was rewriting the policy I would rewrite it to say the policy does not require the listing but it does require the reporting of sales right so such like go ahead I'm sorry we know afterwards like after after a sale is closed there is a there is a responsibility to report sales to the MLS that can be listed post transaction does that make sense yep I think it is valid to point out here that one of the reasons in my opinion and granted this is a little unpopular right now but you know that's the title of show here so that's okay one of the reasons why this this this conversation is so fervent right now and frankly why I expect I will not be surprised if there isn't some pretty dramatic announcements and conversations from the NAR before the conference in Boston this November one of the reasons why I think there's so much momentum here is that following the compensation lawsuit settlements there has been a a an appropriate re emphasis and now laser focus on the development of individualized value and brand differentiation in in in the real estate community the fact that buyer comp is no longer a a like a virtual guarantee the fact that buyers have to actually excuse me buyers agents have to actually prove that they are worthy of the of the commission that they are getting it's not a guarantee written into the listing agreement any longer it is putting into stark re out a stark contrast the fact that your it's not just your brand and your differentiated value in terms of your skill set and experience that matters if clear cooperation goes away you know what else gets added to this list it's your connections it's your ability to source the off market properties or the privately listed properties that other agents can't see and this is where the idea of private listing networks walled gardens that are not the MLS but do contain properties that are for sale this is where a real estate professional can really leverage their connection to their community because those those agents who can leverage that connection to their community and demonstrate that they have access to all of the property that's for sale even the most exclusive even the the non traditionally listed property those are agents that are going to be much more valuable and and be able to differentiate themselves much more strongly than the agents who are just kind of sitting back refreshing Zillow waiting to see what's online we should mention too that NAR created with their own admission created this policy at and one of the objectives was to stem the private listing network stem the the growth of the private listing network you know I again NAR is thinking in terms of equality they want people to have access to the same database so that you know they they can make a good case why it's why why their existence is so important to consumers is they're like we want to make this a level playing field where you have access to everything and we should also mention that in the last week maybe week and a half two major brokerages have come out in against this policy just today or yesterday anywhere one of the largest real estate companies in the world certainly in this country the United States they have most of the big brands that that we know big brokerages they said they were would like to push NAR to abandon the policy Robert Reffkin would Compass did this a week ago basically said the same thing and that's just the first two brokerages to sort of sound off on it because in their perspective I believe is we don't NAR we don't need you to tell us where these listings need to be marketed we we are fiduciaries we are going to operate in our clients best interest and maybe that's the MLS maybe it isn't but we need to be able to make that choice for our agents for our clients yeah and like let's be clear I have a feeling there are some folks even if you work for an anywhere brand you don't know anywhere is the brand that represents Codal banker Century 21 ERA better homes and gardens better homes and gardens souther bees corkren I mean these are like these are the major brands the the major franchise brands in the United States and and honestly there is an interesting set of motivations here but I do want to come back to an interesting point that I kind of made off handedly earlier there are some real estate brands that are pushing against this Glenn Kalman of Redfin is pushing against this there's a handful of places but you know who's really pushing against this is Zillow and the major reason why is and again Zillow your list name call me I got I got some great advice for you here um the major reason Zillow is pushing hard against this is that their business is built on the idea that they're going to get all the listings by virtue whoops and knocking stuff over on my desk I'm so excited about this Zillow Zillow's business is built on the fact that they have unfettered access to all of the properties that are getting listed for sale by virtue of their relationships with these MLS's I mean think about all of the ways that Zillow gets data it is all of these IDX relationships with brokerages if if clear cooperation when a way or excuse me not with brokerages with MLS's if clear cooperation went away and let's say um let's just be conservative here let's say 5% of listings left the MLS's were never listed on the MLS's it doesn't seem like very much but I want you to think about for a moment the amount of traffic that Zillow drives annually even it's it's an extraordinary number there is a not insignificant percentage of that traffic that is driven by consumers who actually don't have any purpose they're they're not looking to actually buy they're looking to use that portal to essentially house surf they're looking for the most outrageous and beautiful listings because they just like looking at houses the biggest the most expensive the most the craziest they want to see the most exclusive listings in their communities or in communities they don't live in those are going to be the first listings that will leave Zillow it is the it's the the most expensive house in your community is the most likely one to take advantage of an exclusive private listing network or not be listed on the MLS at all that is going to have a measurable effect on the traffic of Zillow and if agents start to find success listing properties other than the on places other than the MLS there will be a snowball that will start rolling away from Zillow in terms of the amount of properties that are on that site it right now is like a de facto national MLS right that won't be the case we are going to move to a place where instead of having one national MLS by via by virtue of Zillow we are going to have a hundred small walled gardens across the United States that are these private listing networks that are specific to property type to buyer type that are specific to a you know seller scenarios like kind of the name your price you know like like sellers who are like you know make me sell kind of thing like if I can get the right price I'll sell but otherwise I'm not listing or sellers that are saying I'm interested in selling my home but I don't want to look positive to the full market I don't want everybody seen in my living room that sort of thing that happens Zillow is going to have to pivot it's anymore or they're going to have to build relationships with each of those other listing exchanges and marketplaces and somehow coordinate all of that and we should mention too that yes agents tend to you know a lot of agents tend to think unfavorably about Zillow and whatever your personal feelings are about Zillow they touch something like 90 plus percent of all residential real estate transactions and some portion literally almost everyone is on Zillow at some point the transaction so yes we could all root for Zillow we can root for Zillow to fail as a company because of our personal feelings but is that also in the in the public's good for Zillow to fail I don't know because if it's touching we really we really now are back to sort of what's in the best interest of the public is it better to have 10 grocery stores in town that all have some of the same stuff but have unique items in each grocery store or is it better to have one grocery store well that's a debatable topic right it's a great question I will say this I'm going to make a prediction it's probably unpopular with some folks but if it comes down to a clear cooperation policy disappearing and in order for Zillow to continue to be effective they have to make relationships with these individual private listing networks if that is what is required it's not going to happen because Zillow's relationships were not built with agents they were built with the MLSS that Zillow I mean and who owns 90% of the MLSS it's the National Association of REALTORS Zillow is a partner with the NAR that not with the individual members the individual members didn't sign up for that partnership and we have if this all comes comes comes to pass we have a rare instance where we can literally get a do over here agents can say knowing what I know now about how my relationship has been with this platform in the last 15 years will I willingly re-enter into this relationship with them I got to say I don't think that they will say yes I don't believe that agents will sign up for that again what do you think if you could wave a magic wand and create a policy or a non-policy around clear cooperation what what what do you think would be in in the best and highest good of everyone if I was setting the policy clear cooperation as a as a rule would go away there would be no requirement to market properties actively on the MLS there would be a requirement to report sales to the MLS and in instances where sellers don't want to list on the MLS for privacy concerns there would be a a box for anonymizing listings such that we have the data without the address if that makes sense like we have the listing data but I can't tie it back to a particular transaction the other thing I would say if I was magic waving a magic wand and resetting policy I would first of all I wouldn't set policy at the with a trade group I would uh I would create uh probably regulation in the United States that says here are the ground rules for listing property and tie it to fair housing like we have we already have these these principles in place these foundations of discrimination in place you may advertise your property as long as you violate the laws of the United States we already do this when it comes to rental properties um rental properties can be advertised in a hundred different ways they are not required to be on the MLS we just can't advertise them in ways that break fair housing rules it makes perfect sense that that's the direction we would go with sales too well I very interested to see what will happen again this this really speaks a lot to brokerages continuing their NAR memberships the MLS and and the rare their relationship to national association and just again what's always in the best public interest and the best fiduciary interest of the customer and it is a really thorny issue because there there isn't a clear and obvious solution to this that is clean um but there's certainly certainly more conversations to have I I would love to we rarely ask for feedback but I would love to know what our audience thinks would be in their client's best interest would you prefer to have a decentralized essentially MLS where people could post on different exchanges and you would just have to be aware of those different exchanges and maybe you'd have access to someone not others or would you would you like to see everything in one location I'd be very curious from the agent level what they think would be most effective for them and so please let us know Chris if I would love people to to really chime in on this one what would be the best way for somebody to give you their opinion if they had a specific thought about this yeah I would you can do two things one connect with me on LinkedIn I love I love conversations on LinkedIn I post there every day come on over follow me on LinkedIn comment on a post send me a DM I love to hear from folks too you can find me on Instagram coach chryslyn sell pretty straight forward that's that's an easy place to get a hold of me as well um and yeah share your feedback here this is definitely a conversation that is going to continue to evolve um and I want to make it totally clear I think that the MLS is in itself a good thing I don't think a requirement from a man let me just say this like I like the National Association of REALTORS I believe in its purpose and its value I'm speaking at their conference in Boston if you're listening and you're going to Boston this year for the NAR conference come see me I would love to hear what you have to say I also think that there is a inherent conflict of interest for a trade group that owns a portal to require people to use that portal with and and then also be able to say you know I want side of their mouth require them to use the portal and out of the other side of their mouth say well we are here to represent your best interests even if your best interests are to not post on the MLS just is there's there's cognitive dissonance that needs to be resolved by the removal of a requirement here yeah so whether you believe what I say whether you think I'm full of it I would love to hear from you find me on Instagram find me on LinkedIn or uh just message DJ personally and he can relay it to me I can relay it and also to sound off to your local association let them they work well they don't work for you necessarily but they are there to represent you so please let them know your thoughts because NAR does listen to the local associations were you know NAR is here in Chicago where I'm located and I can tell you for sure that they are their ears are open to what us local associations are wanting and needing also you know as it from a representative let you let the leaders in your community know what you would prefer Chris um great chatting with you again for
