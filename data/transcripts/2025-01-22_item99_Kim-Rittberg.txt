[00:01:33] Hello, it's my meeting with Real Listeners. I'm really excited to have you here. Today, I'm talking
[00:01:39] about how to start showing up and stay showing up on camera to grow your business. So
[00:01:46] if you haven't heard from me before, I love being at Keeping It Real Geeks. My name is Kim Rittberg.
[00:01:51] I am a real estate video coach. I have won six awards for my marketing. I spent 20 years,
[00:01:56] nearly 20 years in media, Netflix as a TV producer and launching the first ever video unit for us
[00:02:02] weekly. But more importantly, I'm now a keynote speaker at events like Inman Connect,
[00:02:06] Berkshire Hathaway's next home. And I love working with agents around the country to get better on
[00:02:13] camera and to make video and podcast content that brings in business. So I really want to talk a
[00:02:19] little bit about how to start showing up and station up on camera and why that's important.
[00:02:24] Before I start, I wanted to let you know I have a program called Video Boot Camp. It is a small
[00:02:29] live group coaching program and the doors closed February 3rd. So make sure to apply if you're
[00:02:35] interested. It is called Video Boot Camp is a live group coaching class that helps you get
[00:02:40] confident on camera. And then once you're confident on camera, which is really the first week or two,
[00:02:44] it then we are shifting right into making awesome video that drives leads and clients.
[00:02:49] Instead of feeling like you're on a hamster wheel or feeling super camera shy or feeling like
[00:02:53] you're putting out content and nothing's happening, I will help you make content that actually drives
[00:02:58] leads and actually convert those leads into sales. So it's really exciting. It's like a full,
[00:03:04] fully built, implemented system. I've had agents across the country saying how much they love it.
[00:03:10] Just two of my agents last year from Video Boot Camp combined had $8 million in sales,
[00:03:16] $8 million in sales through video. So again, it is really, really important to start showing up.
[00:03:23] That is what they did. The women who made $8 million in sales started showing up on video
[00:03:28] and then kept it up consistently. So let's start showing up and stationing up and I'm going to jump
[00:03:32] right in there. But that is Video Boot Camp. It is my signature program. So connect with me on
[00:03:37] Instagram at KIMR-ITT-B-E-R-G or you could go to Kimbritburg.com and contact me there. And I will send you
[00:03:43] the information. It is called Video Boot Camp. And regardless, say hi to me on Instagram. I love
[00:03:49] the keeping it real listeners. So let's talk about why it's important to show up on camera. So
[00:03:56] content converts to cash. That's the number one mindset shift that agents need to have.
[00:04:01] Is understanding that your phone, like your phone, your tiny little thing that's in your hand
[00:04:06] or your pocket all day long buzzing, can convert to cash. Once you have confidence and strategy,
[00:04:15] you are able to make content that drives leads and drives business. So once you're really
[00:04:23] have that mindset shift to understand, it is worth it to invest your time and money in content.
[00:04:29] Then we can start doing the work. But you really really have to understand because I think
[00:04:32] that people come to me and they're like, I think I like a thing I should be on camera, like
[00:04:35] someone told me to be on camera. I listened to a podcast, someone told me I should.
[00:04:39] But the reason why it's super important is 400%
[00:04:43] REALTORS who use video 400% more increase. Video is the most shared type of content.
[00:04:51] So again, when we're talking about why it's like why it matters, it is because it drives business.
[00:04:57] And especially when you think about your service professional, we're selling ourselves,
[00:05:02] we're selling ourselves as people. It's very important to start showing up on camera.
[00:05:07] So the first thing, how to show up on camera and how to stay on camera, the first thing is the
[00:05:11] mindset shift. The mindset shift of realizing content converts to cash. So some strategy that
[00:05:18] goes into that, you have to actually believe that deeply. If you don't believe that content can
[00:05:22] convert to cash, it's not going to happen. It's just not going to happen. So a couple of
[00:05:29] things of going into that mindset shift, the number one is the mindset shift is really busting those
[00:05:34] myths. I have agents come to me and they're like, I feel like I'm, I look silly. I look silly on
[00:05:41] camera. I know you're probably like, oh, shaking your head with agreement. But that's a common
[00:05:45] feeling. But the more you do it, the more you build that muscle, you have to remember you're just
[00:05:51] transferring your in-person confidence skills to camera. It takes some skills work, but the truth
[00:05:56] is you have everything that's needed to be good on camera, right? Like it's a social media era,
[00:06:01] not everybody is like a supermodel or like a TV anchor. It's a lot of regular people who are passionate.
[00:06:06] So you just have to show up and start talking about what you do. You have to get out of supermodel
[00:06:11] mode, where everyone's looking at you and judging you. That's what you think. You get into teacher
[00:06:16] mode where you're really focused on your message and you're not focused on what you're looking,
[00:06:19] how you look, your voice, all of that. So we're going to bust that first myth of your
[00:06:23] gonna look silly. You're not gonna look silly. You're gonna focus on the message for each video
[00:06:26] and you're gonna remember there's an actual lead on the other end of the video.
[00:06:31] Don't think about that mean person in high school who torture you. Think about the potential lead
[00:06:36] who's in your neighborhood and looking for that incredible partner in real estate.
[00:06:41] All right, so first we have that mindset shift. Now we're doing the preparation, right? So first
[00:06:47] mindset shift. Second, the preparation. Everything is hard at first, right? How hard was your first
[00:06:53] week of being real estate? My first week in media, I worked at Inside Edition, the TV show. I had the
[00:06:59] biggest stomach ache. I thought I was going to throw up every single day for three months.
[00:07:03] Three months and one day I woke up. I was like, oh, my stomach ache is gone. And that's how it
[00:07:10] happens, right? So everything is hard at first. So once we're doing that, we say, okay, start with
[00:07:17] the mental preparation. Then we're actually gonna start doing the work and start realizing
[00:07:21] it's hard at first. Let's keep going. Now when we're showing up on camera, we're getting on camera.
[00:07:29] So again, the mindset part. Forget about why does anyone care who's watching this, blah, blah, blah.
[00:07:34] We're just saying I'm speaking as a teacher, I'm connecting with leads in my neighborhood, right?
[00:07:38] I'm just educating them about the neighborhood. I'm talking about how they can save money.
[00:07:43] New neighborhoods they should consider. It's cool stuff happening in the community. I'm looking
[00:07:47] to be their trust and partner. Stop asking yourself who cares about this. People care.
[00:07:52] People want to learn also. People are voyeuristic. So start with the way to start showing up on camera.
[00:08:00] First of all, just get comfortable being on camera. So actually in your room, record yourself
[00:08:06] saying something. A lot of people hate their face on the actual like when you're selfie mode.
[00:08:11] So turn your camera around. Ask someone else to film you or you can film yourself.
[00:08:17] Just talk to camera. I mean, you're thinking like, what am I gonna say? I don't know what to say.
[00:08:21] Talk about what you're doing right now. What are you doing for your business?
[00:08:25] So I want you to take us in and say, right now I'm walking along Main Street. I see there's this new
[00:08:30] development here. It's gonna be a coffee shop and I'm all and I'm really excited. That's a video.
[00:08:36] That is a video. So for me, I would say, all right, I'm preparing to speak at Inman Connect this
[00:08:43] week. Here is my deck that I'm preparing and here's me actually like practicing my speech.
[00:08:48] That's what today looks like. That's a video. Okay, you can take that video. You can put it on
[00:08:52] your social media platforms. Again, you're taking people into your life. So the most important
[00:08:57] thing is you're showing people at your own expert. You're letting them know who you are. When
[00:09:00] you're first starting to show up on camera, start talking about the things that you know. Just like
[00:09:05] what you're doing in your life, what's happening in your business this week. And then once you're
[00:09:09] consistently showing up with confidence, then we're going to layer on that strategy to keep you on
[00:09:14] camera, to have that strategy built in, right? To keep you on camera, you need that accountability,
[00:09:20] the strategy, right? It's easy to show up, start showing up, you build that muscle, but then you
[00:09:25] could fall off. You need that accountability, right? So you're showing up on camera. We're building
[00:09:35] up our bodies. We're feeling good. And you know, when you're thinking about what to talk about on
[00:09:39] camera, if you have a trusted person in your house, a friend, a kid, a spouse, your dog, a colleague,
[00:09:45] feel free to have them record you, right? Have them ask you a question. That's sometimes a little
[00:09:49] bit easier. So start getting on camera by shifting your mental load, mental load, shift your
[00:09:56] mental, have that mental shift and then start preparing, right? Understand that it takes time and
[00:10:02] that's not a problem. You're first going to start with, so that was one is the mental shift,
[00:10:06] two, the preparation, and three, when you're on camera, start talking about the easiest stuff.
[00:10:10] What you're doing right now, what's happening in your business this week, what you're doing this
[00:10:14] weekend, stop asking who cares about this, put that aside, just start posting. Then once you're
[00:10:20] consistently working that muscle and you're feeling confident, then we're going to build the strategy
[00:10:23] on top of that, okay? So those are, that is how to start getting on camera, that has stay on camera.
[00:10:29] I also have like a little get on camera challenge. It's like a seven day get on camera challenge.
[00:10:34] I'll drop that link in the show notes if that's helpful for you, but don't forget video boot camp
[00:10:40] is open for applications, doors closed, February 3rd, it's a small group, so when it's closed,
[00:10:44] it's closed, when it's full, it's full. I only have four spots left. So join the army of real estate
[00:10:49] agents making money off of video, right? Learn how to make holiday, learn how to make quality videos,
[00:10:56] be confident on camera, and what videos are best to make to bring in leads and clients.
[00:11:01] All of that is a video boot camp. It's a small live group coaching program, and it takes you from
[00:11:06] that overwhelm, that stress, that I am wasting my time on social media too. Your time on your phone
[00:11:12] will be generative, revenue generative. You'll be more confident on camera and you'll have a strategy.
[00:11:19] You'll be able to bring in leads and clients through video. This is a fully built out system,
[00:11:23] so I have templates and tools, a whole implementation system, and it's a live group coaching course
[00:11:28] so there's that accountability leading. I understand people fall off, I get it, it's hard to stay on
[00:11:32] top of it. It has that accountability built in there with the live sessions. So all right, that is
[00:11:38] video boot camp. Video boot camp, my live coaching program is open for signups. It closes, the doors
[00:11:46] closed, February 3rd, you'll hop on a call, applying now, if it could be a fit for you, I'll talk
[00:11:50] you through it. I hope you have a great day. My name is Kim Ritberg. I am a real estate video coach,
[00:11:55] and I love helping you grow your leads and clients through video.
