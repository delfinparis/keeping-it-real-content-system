[00:04:17] But let everybody know about this because Kim is a real superstar and we're so, so honored
[00:04:22] to have her.
[00:04:23] So without further ado, let's get to Kim.
[00:04:37] I am so excited to be back with you all on Keeping It Real.
[00:04:41] I heard from so many of you direct message me, you sent me emails.
[00:04:45] I'm so appreciative of this audience.
[00:04:46] You all are investing in yourselves and you really want to learn and I love that because
[00:04:51] I love to teach her.
[00:04:52] Fun fact, I just spoke at the Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Convention in Las Vegas.
[00:04:57] I don't know if any of you were there.
[00:04:58] It was really fun.
[00:05:00] Lots of great people, great teaching, great learning.
[00:05:03] And if you are interested in this episode, that means you're looking to grow your business
[00:05:07] with video.
[00:05:08] So if you're struggling to show up on video or you're making some video but it's not
[00:05:13] landing your ideal clients, I have a brand new video bootcamp.
[00:05:16] It teaches you how to attract your ideal client and grow your lead's income and credibility.
[00:05:22] I've dozens of awesome testimonials on my site you can see but be sure to check it
[00:05:25] out as soon as possible in my last bootcamp.
[00:05:27] Actually, I have to close the doors early.
[00:05:30] So you can apply now.
[00:05:31] It's not minding.
[00:05:32] You can just apply and we can see if it's a fit.
[00:05:34] Basically in the class, you'll get a system and a process to create content consistently
[00:05:37] and efficiently.
[00:05:38] No burnout.
[00:05:40] You get prebuilt scripts and templates for videos.
[00:05:43] A proper setup for filming.
[00:05:44] I teach you how to repurpose your content, meaning you film once and you get 10 videos.
[00:05:48] And a brainstorm process.
[00:05:49] And lots of accountability from me.
[00:05:52] I am an award-winning video strategist.
[00:05:55] I spent 10 years in TV news.
[00:05:56] I worked at Pop Shutter Video, a weekly video and Netflix marketing.
[00:06:01] But now for the past five years, I've been helping business owners and professionals
[00:06:05] grow with video and I've won some awards.
[00:06:07] And anyway, it's really fun.
[00:06:08] So let's jump in and I want to teach you some stuff.
[00:06:11] So today I want to teach you about five great video ideas that you can make today as
[00:06:17] a real estate agent.
[00:06:18] The idea of video I like to bring it back to the basics is video is not just, okay,
[00:06:24] I post a video.
[00:06:25] Here's the client.
[00:06:26] Video has this amazing ability to reach your existing clients or existing network,
[00:06:33] find new leads, new potential clients and reignite old contacts.
[00:06:39] By that, I mean, you can have a contact.
[00:06:41] Come out of the woodwork you haven't seen in five or 10 years.
[00:06:44] My agents that I work with in one-on-one in group coaching are seeing this.
[00:06:48] They have someone reach out.
[00:06:50] They haven't seen in five years.
[00:06:51] They say, hey, David, I love your Instagram.
[00:06:53] I'm seeing you really showing up.
[00:06:55] And because the content is on brand and it's focusing on educating or entertaining
[00:07:01] that it's really connecting.
[00:07:04] So I really want to start with that because I think it's important before we talk about
[00:07:08] the video ideas, we remember what video can do for us.
[00:07:12] And again, I'm going to do another quick little tip before I give you my ideas.
[00:07:16] When you make video, remember to make your video one of the three ease.
[00:07:21] Entertaining educational or emotional.
[00:07:24] Meaning that is what you want the watcher to walk away with.
[00:07:28] So we're never selling.
[00:07:29] We're very, really selling.
[00:07:31] Like even, you know, maybe you're saying, oh, I won this award or maybe you're saying just close,
[00:07:35] just listed.
[00:07:36] That's, that should be like 20% of your social feed.
[00:07:39] To really convert, to really bring people into you and into your network and be building that
[00:07:44] relationship.
[00:07:45] A tiny portion should be selling.
[00:07:47] But remember, you're making this content because when you bring people in,
[00:07:52] when you build that relationship, eventually ideally they will be a client and it's not a client
[00:07:57] or refer.
[00:07:58] So that's just something to really keep in mind before we jump into the ideas,
[00:08:02] just level setting, what it can do.
[00:08:04] And these ideas are really agnostic of platform.
[00:08:07] It doesn't matter if you're on Facebook or TikTok or Instagram or YouTube,
[00:08:11] all of these videos, they work.
[00:08:12] You know, they're really solid ideas.
[00:08:16] They're really showcased you and it doesn't matter where you are.
[00:08:19] And this is basically, these are five ideas I use.
[00:08:22] I sprinkle them throughout my real estate agent.
[00:08:24] And they work.
[00:08:25] They're just like fun ideas that bring people into you.
[00:08:28] So number one, first idea.
[00:08:31] Position yourself as a neighborhood expert.
[00:08:33] So that can go as a tour of the neighborhood you represent.
[00:08:38] It could also be a feature on some businesses.
[00:08:42] And the reason why these are really good is because if you're selling,
[00:08:45] let's say I live in Brooklyn, New York.
[00:08:47] So if I'm selling in Brooklyn, I want people to realize I'm really the expert.
[00:08:51] I know the values, I know the people, I know which blocks are the best,
[00:08:56] which, you know, where you can walk your dog.
[00:08:59] It's really important to position yourself as the expert.
[00:09:02] So that can be, you can be holding your camera.
[00:09:05] And again, you do not need a lot of fancy expensive equipment.
[00:09:08] Actually, an iPhone is awesome because people feel like they get to know you.
[00:09:12] So you're going to hold your camera out in front of you.
[00:09:16] We're going to selfie stick.
[00:09:17] I don't really use a selfie stick.
[00:09:19] I just hold my camera.
[00:09:20] It depends how long your arm is.
[00:09:22] You're going to hold it in front of you.
[00:09:23] And you're going to make sure you're standing a little bit far back.
[00:09:25] You want people to see the street.
[00:09:28] You, that's called an establishing shot.
[00:09:30] If you ever notice in TV before you see a scene,
[00:09:33] you'll see the outside of a house or the city,
[00:09:35] you know, like the Los Angeles cityscape or the New York City Skyline.
[00:09:40] They're establishing where you are.
[00:09:41] So you're going to want to stand in the main street of your town
[00:09:45] or in a really beautiful park that everybody recognizes.
[00:09:48] And you're going to introduce the concept of the video.
[00:09:51] You are not going to start with your name because especially if you're making short form video,
[00:09:55] that's not a good use of the beginning seconds.
[00:09:57] You're going to say, do you want to know all about Brooklyn Heights?
[00:10:00] Let's jump in.
[00:10:01] Or I just discovered the best
[00:10:06] top of spot in all of Brooklyn.
[00:10:09] Check it out.
[00:10:10] And so you're basically starting with your headline.
[00:10:12] You're always starting with your headline.
[00:10:13] And then you're jumping right into the video.
[00:10:15] So that's number one.
[00:10:17] First idea is being a neighborhood expert.
[00:10:20] Number two is an SEO driven video.
[00:10:23] SEO says research engine optimization.
[00:10:27] What this means is that Google can find your video.
[00:10:31] So SEO, even though I'm saying Google,
[00:10:34] it's really just the ability to have words that people can find.
[00:10:37] So if you're an Instagram and your video says
[00:10:42] Brooklyn's best restaurants,
[00:10:46] Brooklyn's most family friendly restaurants.
[00:10:49] And that's in your caption.
[00:10:51] Someone in Instagram can actually search that and find you.
[00:10:53] So that's very valuable when you think about it.
[00:10:55] Right? Being able to be searched is very valuable.
[00:10:58] So what you can do to find a great idea that people are searching for,
[00:11:02] you can go on Google, start searching words about your neighborhood,
[00:11:06] about your area.
[00:11:07] See what people are asking.
[00:11:08] You can go to Quora QURA.
[00:11:12] That's a forum where people ask questions.
[00:11:15] Reddit, R-E-D-D-I-T. Reddit is a good one.
[00:11:17] And YouTube.
[00:11:18] And you're going to be looking at what is out there and what people are searching for.
[00:11:23] Ever search in Google and you stop like,
[00:11:25] what can I find in or what's the best neighborhood in?
[00:11:29] It will fill in the blank for you.
[00:11:30] So basically you want to see what other people are searching for.
[00:11:34] And so that video, it can be, you can execute it on whatever you want.
[00:11:38] But if I found that people are searching for in Brooklyn,
[00:11:41] you know, which neighborhood in Brooklyn is closest to Manhattan or something like that.
[00:11:47] Now that I know people are searching for that,
[00:11:49] I'm going to make a video about that.
[00:11:51] I'm going to stand right in the neighborhood and I'm going to film myself.
[00:11:54] I'm going to put something great in visual over my shoulder.
[00:11:56] I'm going to stand where the Brooklyn bridge is.
[00:11:58] But I'm probably not going to stand somewhere too noisy or too windy because you're not going to hear me.
[00:12:03] But I'm going to stand in front of the Brooklyn bridge and I'm going to say,
[00:12:05] where should you live in Brooklyn if you work in Manhattan and you're looking for short commute?
[00:12:10] Here are the top three neighborhoods that are closest to Manhattan.
[00:12:13] And then basically I will talk a little bit about it.
[00:12:16] So that's number two.
[00:12:18] Number one, we have the neighborhood expert video.
[00:12:20] Number two, we had an SEO driven video.
[00:12:23] Number three, commonly asked questions.
[00:12:26] Basically you are obviously an expert.
[00:12:30] You're not just a real estate professional.
[00:12:31] You're an expert.
[00:12:32] You talk to dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of people.
[00:12:36] And so what you should be thinking about is, what do they ask me a lot?
[00:12:40] Because if a lot of people have already asked you, it means more people want to ask you that.
[00:12:44] So that's a really great thread to pull out to come up with ideas.
[00:12:48] So if you always get asked, what's going on with interest rates?
[00:12:52] Or should I buy a condor or a co-op?
[00:12:55] Or this new area, you know, do you think it'll be hot in a few years?
[00:13:01] Whatever the question is, you're going to make a video about that specifically.
[00:13:08] And remember, you don't actually have to,
[00:13:13] you don't actually need to answer all of the answers.
[00:13:17] Because it's a short form video, you only have to fill like 15, 30, 45 seconds.
[00:13:23] Shorter is better.
[00:13:24] So you take your commonly asked question and you answer it.
[00:13:28] And again, you're always starting with a headline because it's the headline that grabs people
[00:13:32] and brings them into the video.
[00:13:35] And when I say a headline, I mean, you start with that thought that really catch a headline.
[00:13:39] And you also write on screen with words, your headline.
[00:13:44] So number four, a trending sound video.
[00:13:49] I think you all know what this is, but if not, I will describe it.
[00:13:54] Basically, you know, all of the lip syncing and all the dancing, right?
[00:13:57] On Instagram and TikTok, they're not all dancing and singing.
[00:14:00] Sometimes they're just like music and someone's doing something to music.
[00:14:04] Basically, those trending sounds come up more.
[00:14:09] So we just talked about search engine optimization.
[00:14:11] It means Google and find you better.
[00:14:13] Well, a trending sound, if you use it, it increases the ability for people to find you.
[00:14:19] We call that discoverability.
[00:14:21] So if you use a trending sound, you increase the discoverability of your social feed.
[00:14:27] So you can use that song in a fun way where you know, someone's dancing to the song or
[00:14:33] lip syncing to the song.
[00:14:35] You also can just show something about your business.
[00:14:38] It could be behind the scenes of what you do each day and just use a trending song.
[00:14:41] But it is really important to think about that as a potential
[00:14:45] use because if you're putting all your videos without sound,
[00:14:48] you're really losing a really good opportunity.
[00:14:50] I want to say something about trending sounds.
[00:14:53] It's very, very important to be solid on your message.
[00:14:57] And when I say your message, I mean your brand message,
[00:15:00] what makes you unique in terms to make this work.
[00:15:04] Because otherwise, it takes a really long time.
[00:15:07] If you see a trend out there, like someone's dancing to some fun song,
[00:15:10] and they're writing some texts on it,
[00:15:13] if you don't really know what your main content topics are,
[00:15:16] it becomes very hard and very time consuming to all of a sudden jump on like a fun trending song.
[00:15:22] So it's very important that like before you have a make it into this content,
[00:15:25] you really know what you talk about.
[00:15:28] Who you are, right?
[00:15:30] Who are you as a brand?
[00:15:32] So when someone comes to me, I say, I help business owners and real estate professionals
[00:15:37] grow their leads in coming credibility.
[00:15:38] I also let them know I'm a mom of two.
[00:15:41] I live in Brooklyn.
[00:15:42] I love art.
[00:15:43] Other little things.
[00:15:45] So when you get to my social feed, you're like,
[00:15:47] oh, okay, this makes sense.
[00:15:48] I understand who this person is.
[00:15:49] And when I'm trying to jump on a fun trending video,
[00:15:52] I know what I talk about.
[00:15:54] I basically talk about video.
[00:15:56] I talk about being better on camera.
[00:15:58] I talk about being a working mom.
[00:16:00] And so, those are the sort of topics you'll be seeing there.
[00:16:03] And then it makes it easier for me to make a video quickly
[00:16:06] when a trending music comes up.
[00:16:09] And speaking of making something quickly,
[00:16:11] video number five, I recommend, is a timely video.
[00:16:15] My first 10 years of my career was in news.
[00:16:18] And I have seen the ability for people to really get a lot of attention
[00:16:21] by pegging themselves to a news hook.
[00:16:24] And a news hook doesn't have to be something political.
[00:16:27] Or sad.
[00:16:27] It doesn't have to be news.
[00:16:28] It just has to be timely.
[00:16:30] So for, I think the easiest way to think about it for real estate is
[00:16:34] the next thing, the next time a big thing happens in the market,
[00:16:38] in the financial markets, you should get on video
[00:16:41] and put your opinion on it.
[00:16:43] So for example, I'm going to give you a real life example.
[00:16:45] My agent, David, we were shooting a bunch of,
[00:16:48] we were shooting a LinkedIn live.
[00:16:49] And then it was the Silicon Valley bank failure.
[00:16:52] So we made sure to film immediately the impact of that on New York City.
[00:16:58] I'm New York City real estate.
[00:17:00] And it's your opinion.
[00:17:02] So not only does it have the benefit of being a timely video
[00:17:06] that people really want to see,
[00:17:08] it has the benefit of putting you out there as an expert,
[00:17:11] as a thought leader.
[00:17:13] And so I think that that's something to really keep in mind.
[00:17:18] And when I talk about timely,
[00:17:19] it doesn't need to be news news news like I mentioned before.
[00:17:22] It could be pop culture moments.
[00:17:23] So in my recent video bootcamp,
[00:17:25] one of my students, Sarah, as I taught her,
[00:17:27] to really think about pop culture moments
[00:17:29] and try to jump on it in terms of video content.
[00:17:32] And this was right after the Rihanna Super Bowl moment
[00:17:35] where she announced her pregnancy with this amazing red leather flutter,
[00:17:39] standings outfit.
[00:17:40] And I sent out a quick newsletter to everybody saying,
[00:17:44] make sure to peg something to the Super Bowl to Rihanna specifically.
[00:17:49] And she did.
[00:17:50] She showed up on a video and it wasn't like a dancing or singing video.
[00:17:53] It was her reaction to Rihanna.
[00:17:55] And that reel, instead of getting her normal few hundred views,
[00:17:59] it got 13,000 views.
[00:18:01] Because she did it at the right time.
[00:18:03] And she had a different angle on it.
[00:18:05] Again, she's talking to camera,
[00:18:06] just talking about Rihanna's experience.
[00:18:08] It wasn't a highly edited or highly polished video.
[00:18:11] But when you're really thinking about what other people are thinking about,
[00:18:15] and you put yourself into the conversation,
[00:18:17] it could be really good.
[00:18:18] And I do want to say here,
[00:18:21] when you're making these videos,
[00:18:22] there are ways to optimize it.
[00:18:24] And that's something I go over in my video bootcamp,
[00:18:26] basically building your brand,
[00:18:28] making great video, and then getting it discovered.
[00:18:31] So, you know, when you're trying to do those timely videos,
[00:18:35] adding in the right hashtags,
[00:18:36] so you can get discovered.
[00:18:38] And if this is all overwhelming for you,
[00:18:40] don't worry, because I have a video bootcamp,
[00:18:41] opening up really soon,
[00:18:44] applications will open soon if you go to KimRittberg.com.
[00:18:47] But I did want to mention about discovery,
[00:18:49] because when you're trying to jump on a trend,
[00:18:52] when you're trying to jump on a new story,
[00:18:54] you really want to make sure you're appearing
[00:18:56] to people's speed so that they can find you.
[00:18:59] A couple of other things that, as I was going through,
[00:19:01] is I just going to recommend,
[00:19:03] I talked a little bit about the idea of a headline.
[00:19:06] And a headline in a hook is basically the idea
[00:19:09] that the very first few seconds of your video
[00:19:11] is the best chance to get people.
[00:19:13] So, when you're having your idea,
[00:19:17] really try to think of a headline
[00:19:18] that like a media outlet would use.
[00:19:20] So, instead of starting your video
[00:19:23] with the text on it being like,
[00:19:25] here's a restaurant in Brooklyn,
[00:19:27] it's not a great headline.
[00:19:29] But how about the most delicious
[00:19:31] topest restaurant in Brooklyn,
[00:19:32] or three new restaurants you need to try right now in Brooklyn?
[00:19:36] That's a better headline, right?
[00:19:37] It's a little spicier,
[00:19:39] it's a little more engaging.
[00:19:41] It really has more of that hook to hook people in.
[00:19:45] And then the other thing I wanted to
[00:19:46] remind people about is the brand,
[00:19:49] the element of it,
[00:19:50] and really like being solid on understanding
[00:19:52] who you are and what you bring.
[00:19:54] And it's important to know that
[00:19:56] because it really helps you figure out fresh ideas.
[00:19:59] Because you really want to try to be yourself
[00:20:01] and the best version of yourself
[00:20:02] because you're putting yourself out there
[00:20:03] as an expert.
[00:20:05] Like you're really a thought leader in your field.
[00:20:08] So, I think that's important.
[00:20:10] Another thing, this is kind of like
[00:20:11] if I'm giving tips, maybe that's one class,
[00:20:14] one level 101 or class 201.
[00:20:16] I'm going to give you a little bit of a video,
[00:20:18] three 01 tip.
[00:20:20] When you're filming, especially outside,
[00:20:23] but inside too,
[00:20:24] a great way to get higher engagement,
[00:20:28] more people watching,
[00:20:29] more people staying through the video,
[00:20:31] you can switch where you are.
[00:20:33] So, for my example earlier,
[00:20:35] where I'm filming near the Brooklyn Bridge,
[00:20:38] media I want to hold up my camera and start seeing.
[00:20:42] Want to know the Brooklyn neighborhoods
[00:20:43] that are closest to Manhattan?
[00:20:45] So, you have a great commute.
[00:20:46] So, maybe I start with a shot of the Brooklyn Bridge behind me.
[00:20:51] But then on my second frame,
[00:20:53] frame meaning the next moment in the video,
[00:20:55] I'm, I stop, I start the next one,
[00:20:58] and I turn my body a little bit,
[00:21:00] and I have an entirely different background.
[00:21:02] Changing the visuals does a lot to keep people there.
[00:21:07] You know, I think we get used to seeing
[00:21:11] that talking head, really like a person
[00:21:13] just talking to the camera, it's fine,
[00:21:15] it's not a problem,
[00:21:16] it's better than not doing video,
[00:21:17] it's a great way to showcase who you are and what you do.
[00:21:21] But if you can add in more visual intrigue,
[00:21:24] more visual interest in it,
[00:21:25] that is great.
[00:21:27] And all you need to do,
[00:21:28] basically you have your first shot,
[00:21:30] where you're filming at the Brooklyn Bridge,
[00:21:31] your second shot where you turned it a little bit,
[00:21:33] and you're showing some neighborhood in Dumbo,
[00:21:36] another Brooklyn area.
[00:21:37] And then you're turning your,
[00:21:39] back to your third shot,
[00:21:41] it can be the same as your first shot.
[00:21:42] So, it doesn't have to be so complicated,
[00:21:44] but if you can and you want to level up just that little bit,
[00:21:47] you can.
[00:21:47] But that's really like a,
[00:21:48] that's really like an A plus apple for the teacher stuff,
[00:21:51] so don't worry too much about that.
[00:21:54] And again, thank you.
[00:21:55] I really love hearing from you,
[00:21:57] so message me which one of these videos you're going to do.
[00:21:59] And tag me, because a lot of you,
[00:22:01] I forgot to tell you, a lot of you tagged me in your videos,
[00:22:04] and I was so happy to hear from you.
[00:22:06] I was like, yes,
[00:22:07] teachers, people are the best.
[00:22:08] So, make one of these videos.
[00:22:11] Again, I'm going to list out the videos,
[00:22:13] a neighborhood expert video,
[00:22:15] an SEO-driven video,
[00:22:17] meaning something people search for on Google or YouTube,
[00:22:20] commonly asked questions.
[00:22:21] What people ask you specifically,
[00:22:23] just answer one of those questions in a short form video.
[00:22:26] For, you can make a video off of a trending sound.
[00:22:29] It can be like a dancing video or a singing video.
[00:22:33] Number five, a timely video.
[00:22:35] Pag your next video to something happening.
[00:22:37] It could be something local.
[00:22:38] It could be like a big sports game in your neighborhood,
[00:22:40] or a big news event.
[00:22:41] But those are those five videos.
[00:22:43] I want you to make one of these,
[00:22:45] post it, and you're going to tag me.
[00:22:47] It's at Kim KIM RITB-ERG.
[00:22:52] So don't forget,
[00:22:53] you're going to make it, you're going to tag me.
[00:22:55] And if you're really looking to level up your video game,
[00:22:59] and you really want to get out of that,
[00:23:01] like, I don't know what to make,
[00:23:02] how do I make good video,
[00:23:03] all of that stuff.
[00:23:04] And my video bootcamp is opening in mid-April.
[00:23:07] It sold out early.
[00:23:09] So if you're interested up fly now,
[00:23:10] there's not binding.
[00:23:11] Just go to my website, KimRITB-ERG.com.
[00:23:14] You go to Coaches and Coaches and Coaching.
[00:23:17] And from there, you can put in your information.
[00:23:19] And basically, I'm going to show you how to set up,
[00:23:21] or how to set up to shoot great videos,
[00:23:24] how to repurpose your content,
[00:23:25] an amazing system of process to create.
[00:23:27] Lots of awesome content, efficiently.
[00:23:29] I can use scripts and templates.
[00:23:31] Basically, you got my 15 years of knowledge
[00:23:33] in a seven-week bootcamp.
[00:23:34] But it's in a fun way.
[00:23:36] And there's a lot of accountability.
[00:23:37] So we'll make videos together.
[00:23:38] You'll get my input on those videos
[00:23:41] during live coaching sessions.
[00:23:42] It's a live coaching program.
[00:23:44] So thank you so much for having me.
[00:23:46] I love hearing from you.

But let everybody know about this because Kim is a real superstar and we're so, so honored to have her. So without further ado, let's get to Kim. I am so excited to be back with you all on Keeping It Real. I heard from so many of you direct message me, you sent me emails. I'm so appreciative of this audience. You all are investing in yourselves and you really want to learn and I love that because I love to teach her. Fun fact, I just spoke at the Berkshire Hathaway Home Services Convention in Las Vegas. I don't know if any of you were there. It was really fun. Lots of great people, great teaching, great learning. And if you are interested in this episode, that means you're looking to grow your business with video. So if you're struggling to show up on video or you're making some video but it's not landing your ideal clients, I have a brand new video bootcamp. It teaches you how to attract your ideal client and grow your lead's income and credibility. I've dozens of awesome testimonials on my site you can see but be sure to check it out as soon as possible in my last bootcamp. Actually, I have to close the doors early. So you can apply now. It's not minding. You can just apply and we can see if it's a fit. Basically in the class, you'll get a system and a process to create content consistently and efficiently. No burnout. You get prebuilt scripts and templates for videos. A proper setup for filming. I teach you how to repurpose your content, meaning you film once and you get 10 videos. And a brainstorm process. And lots of accountability from me. I am an award-winning video strategist. I spent 10 years in TV news. I worked at Pop Shutter Video, a weekly video and Netflix marketing. But now for the past five years, I've been helping business owners and professionals grow with video and I've won some awards. And anyway, it's really fun. So let's jump in and I want to teach you some stuff. So today I want to teach you about five great video ideas that you can make today as a real estate agent. The idea of video I like to bring it back to the basics is video is not just, okay, I post a video. Here's the client. Video has this amazing ability to reach your existing clients or existing network, find new leads, new potential clients and reignite old contacts. By that, I mean, you can have a contact. Come out of the woodwork you haven't seen in five or 10 years. My agents that I work with in one-on-one in group coaching are seeing this. They have someone reach out. They haven't seen in five years. They say, hey, David, I love your Instagram. I'm seeing you really showing up. And because the content is on brand and it's focusing on educating or entertaining that it's really connecting. So I really want to start with that because I think it's important before we talk about the video ideas, we remember what video can do for us. And again, I'm going to do another quick little tip before I give you my ideas. When you make video, remember to make your video one of the three ease. Entertaining educational or emotional. Meaning that is what you want the watcher to walk away with. So we're never selling. We're very, really selling. Like even, you know, maybe you're saying, oh, I won this award or maybe you're saying just close, just listed. That's, that should be like 20% of your social feed. To really convert, to really bring people into you and into your network and be building that relationship. A tiny portion should be selling. But remember, you're making this content because when you bring people in, when you build that relationship, eventually ideally they will be a client and it's not a client or refer. So that's just something to really keep in mind before we jump into the ideas, just level setting, what it can do. And these ideas are really agnostic of platform. It doesn't matter if you're on Facebook or TikTok or Instagram or YouTube, all of these videos, they work. You know, they're really solid ideas. They're really showcased you and it doesn't matter where you are. And this is basically, these are five ideas I use. I sprinkle them throughout my real estate agent. And they work. They're just like fun ideas that bring people into you. So number one, first idea. Position yourself as a neighborhood expert. So that can go as a tour of the neighborhood you represent. It could also be a feature on some businesses. And the reason why these are really good is because if you're selling, let's say I live in Brooklyn, New York. So if I'm selling in Brooklyn, I want people to realize I'm really the expert. I know the values, I know the people, I know which blocks are the best, which, you know, where you can walk your dog. It's really important to position yourself as the expert. So that can be, you can be holding your camera. And again, you do not need a lot of fancy expensive equipment. Actually, an iPhone is awesome because people feel like they get to know you. So you're going to hold your camera out in front of you. We're going to selfie stick. I don't really use a selfie stick. I just hold my camera. It depends how long your arm is. You're going to hold it in front of you. And you're going to make sure you're standing a little bit far back. You want people to see the street. You, that's called an establishing shot. If you ever notice in TV before you see a scene, you'll see the outside of a house or the city, you know, like the Los Angeles cityscape or the New York City Skyline. They're establishing where you are. So you're going to want to stand in the main street of your town or in a really beautiful park that everybody recognizes. And you're going to introduce the concept of the video. You are not going to start with your name because especially if you're making short form video, that's not a good use of the beginning seconds. You're going to say, do you want to know all about Brooklyn Heights? Let's jump in. Or I just discovered the best top of spot in all of Brooklyn. Check it out. And so you're basically starting with your headline. You're always starting with your headline. And then you're jumping right into the video. So that's number one. First idea is being a neighborhood expert. Number two is an SEO driven video. SEO says research engine optimization. What this means is that Google can find your video. So SEO, even though I'm saying Google, it's really just the ability to have words that people can find. So if you're an Instagram and your video says Brooklyn's best restaurants, Brooklyn's most family friendly restaurants. And that's in your caption. Someone in Instagram can actually search that and find you. So that's very valuable when you think about it. Right? Being able to be searched is very valuable. So what you can do to find a great idea that people are searching for, you can go on Google, start searching words about your neighborhood, about your area. See what people are asking. You can go to Quora QURA. That's a forum where people ask questions. Reddit, R-E-D-D-I-T. Reddit is a good one. And YouTube. And you're going to be looking at what is out there and what people are searching for. Ever search in Google and you stop like, what can I find in or what's the best neighborhood in? It will fill in the blank for you. So basically you want to see what other people are searching for. And so that video, it can be, you can execute it on whatever you want. But if I found that people are searching for in Brooklyn, you know, which neighborhood in Brooklyn is closest to Manhattan or something like that. Now that I know people are searching for that, I'm going to make a video about that. I'm going to stand right in the neighborhood and I'm going to film myself. I'm going to put something great in visual over my shoulder. I'm going to stand where the Brooklyn bridge is. But I'm probably not going to stand somewhere too noisy or too windy because you're not going to hear me. But I'm going to stand in front of the Brooklyn bridge and I'm going to say, where should you live in Brooklyn if you work in Manhattan and you're looking for short commute? Here are the top three neighborhoods that are closest to Manhattan. And then basically I will talk a little bit about it. So that's number two. Number one, we have the neighborhood expert video. Number two, we had an SEO driven video. Number three, commonly asked questions. Basically you are obviously an expert. You're not just a real estate professional. You're an expert. You talk to dozens, hundreds, maybe thousands of people. And so what you should be thinking about is, what do they ask me a lot? Because if a lot of people have already asked you, it means more people want to ask you that. So that's a really great thread to pull out to come up with ideas. So if you always get asked, what's going on with interest rates? Or should I buy a condor or a co-op? Or this new area, you know, do you think it'll be hot in a few years? Whatever the question is, you're going to make a video about that specifically. And remember, you don't actually have to, you don't actually need to answer all of the answers. Because it's a short form video, you only have to fill like 15, 30, 45 seconds. Shorter is better. So you take your commonly asked question and you answer it. And again, you're always starting with a headline because it's the headline that grabs people and brings them into the video. And when I say a headline, I mean, you start with that thought that really catch a headline. And you also write on screen with words, your headline. So number four, a trending sound video. I think you all know what this is, but if not, I will describe it. Basically, you know, all of the lip syncing and all the dancing, right? On Instagram and TikTok, they're not all dancing and singing. Sometimes they're just like music and someone's doing something to music. Basically, those trending sounds come up more. So we just talked about search engine optimization. It means Google and find you better. Well, a trending sound, if you use it, it increases the ability for people to find you. We call that discoverability. So if you use a trending sound, you increase the discoverability of your social feed. So you can use that song in a fun way where you know, someone's dancing to the song or lip syncing to the song. You also can just show something about your business. It could be behind the scenes of what you do each day and just use a trending song. But it is really important to think about that as a potential use because if you're putting all your videos without sound, you're really losing a really good opportunity. I want to say something about trending sounds. It's very, very important to be solid on your message. And when I say your message, I mean your brand message, what makes you unique in terms to make this work. Because otherwise, it takes a really long time. If you see a trend out there, like someone's dancing to some fun song, and they're writing some texts on it, if you don't really know what your main content topics are, it becomes very hard and very time consuming to all of a sudden jump on like a fun trending song. So it's very important that like before you have a make it into this content, you really know what you talk about. Who you are, right? Who are you as a brand? So when someone comes to me, I say, I help business owners and real estate professionals grow their leads in coming credibility. I also let them know I'm a mom of two. I live in Brooklyn. I love art. Other little things. So when you get to my social feed, you're like, oh, okay, this makes sense. I understand who this person is. And when I'm trying to jump on a fun trending video, I know what I talk about. I basically talk about video. I talk about being better on camera. I talk about being a working mom. And so, those are the sort of topics you'll be seeing there. And then it makes it easier for me to make a video quickly when a trending music comes up. And speaking of making something quickly, video number five, I recommend, is a timely video. My first 10 years of my career was in news. And I have seen the ability for people to really get a lot of attention by pegging themselves to a news hook. And a news hook doesn't have to be something political. Or sad. It doesn't have to be news. It just has to be timely. So for, I think the easiest way to think about it for real estate is the next thing, the next time a big thing happens in the market, in the financial markets, you should get on video and put your opinion on it. So for example, I'm going to give you a real life example. My agent, David, we were shooting a bunch of, we were shooting a LinkedIn live. And then it was the Silicon Valley bank failure. So we made sure to film immediately the impact of that on New York City. I'm New York City real estate. And it's your opinion. So not only does it have the benefit of being a timely video that people really want to see, it has the benefit of putting you out there as an expert, as a thought leader. And so I think that that's something to really keep in mind. And when I talk about timely, it doesn't need to be news news news like I mentioned before. It could be pop culture moments. So in my recent video bootcamp, one of my students, Sarah, as I taught her, to really think about pop culture moments and try to jump on it in terms of video content. And this was right after the Rihanna Super Bowl moment where she announced her pregnancy with this amazing red leather flutter, standings outfit. And I sent out a quick newsletter to everybody saying, make sure to peg something to the Super Bowl to Rihanna specifically. And she did. She showed up on a video and it wasn't like a dancing or singing video. It was her reaction to Rihanna. And that reel, instead of getting her normal few hundred views, it got 13,000 views. Because she did it at the right time. And she had a different angle on it. Again, she's talking to camera, just talking about Rihanna's experience. It wasn't a highly edited or highly polished video. But when you're really thinking about what other people are thinking about, and you put yourself into the conversation, it could be really good. And I do want to say here, when you're making these videos, there are ways to optimize it. And that's something I go over in my video bootcamp, basically building your brand, making great video, and then getting it discovered. So, you know, when you're trying to do those timely videos, adding in the right hashtags, so you can get discovered. And if this is all overwhelming for you, don't worry, because I have a video bootcamp, opening up really soon, applications will open soon if you go to KimRittberg.com. But I did want to mention about discovery, because when you're trying to jump on a trend, when you're trying to jump on a new story, you really want to make sure you're appearing to people's speed so that they can find you. A couple of other things that, as I was going through, is I just going to recommend, I talked a little bit about the idea of a headline. And a headline in a hook is basically the idea that the very first few seconds of your video is the best chance to get people. So, when you're having your idea, really try to think of a headline that like a media outlet would use. So, instead of starting your video with the text on it being like, here's a restaurant in Brooklyn, it's not a great headline. But how about the most delicious topest restaurant in Brooklyn, or three new restaurants you need to try right now in Brooklyn? That's a better headline, right? It's a little spicier, it's a little more engaging. It really has more of that hook to hook people in. And then the other thing I wanted to remind people about is the brand, the element of it, and really like being solid on understanding who you are and what you bring. And it's important to know that because it really helps you figure out fresh ideas. Because you really want to try to be yourself and the best version of yourself because you're putting yourself out there as an expert. Like you're really a thought leader in your field. So, I think that's important. Another thing, this is kind of like if I'm giving tips, maybe that's one class, one level 101 or class 201. I'm going to give you a little bit of a video, three 01 tip. When you're filming, especially outside, but inside too, a great way to get higher engagement, more people watching, more people staying through the video, you can switch where you are. So, for my example earlier, where I'm filming near the Brooklyn Bridge, media I want to hold up my camera and start seeing. Want to know the Brooklyn neighborhoods that are closest to Manhattan? So, you have a great commute. So, maybe I start with a shot of the Brooklyn Bridge behind me. But then on my second frame, frame meaning the next moment in the video, I'm, I stop, I start the next one, and I turn my body a little bit, and I have an entirely different background. Changing the visuals does a lot to keep people there. You know, I think we get used to seeing that talking head, really like a person just talking to the camera, it's fine, it's not a problem, it's better than not doing video, it's a great way to showcase who you are and what you do. But if you can add in more visual intrigue, more visual interest in it, that is great. And all you need to do, basically you have your first shot, where you're filming at the Brooklyn Bridge, your second shot where you turned it a little bit, and you're showing some neighborhood in Dumbo, another Brooklyn area. And then you're turning your, back to your third shot, it can be the same as your first shot. So, it doesn't have to be so complicated, but if you can and you want to level up just that little bit, you can. But that's really like a, that's really like an A plus apple for the teacher stuff, so don't worry too much about that. And again, thank you. I really love hearing from you, so message me which one of these videos you're going to do. And tag me, because a lot of you, I forgot to tell you, a lot of you tagged me in your videos, and I was so happy to hear from you. I was like, yes, teachers, people are the best. So, make one of these videos. Again, I'm going to list out the videos, a neighborhood expert video, an SEO-driven video, meaning something people search for on Google or YouTube, commonly asked questions. What people ask you specifically, just answer one of those questions in a short form video. For, you can make a video off of a trending sound. It can be like a dancing video or a singing video. Number five, a timely video. Pag your next video to something happening. It could be something local. It could be like a big sports game in your neighborhood, or a big news event. But those are those five videos. I want you to make one of these, post it, and you're going to tag me. It's at Kim KIM RITB-ERG. So don't forget, you're going to make it, you're going to tag me. And if you're really looking to level up your video game, and you really want to get out of that, like, I don't know what to make, how do I make good video, all of that stuff.
