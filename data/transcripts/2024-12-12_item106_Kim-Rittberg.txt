[00:00:00] Agents usually find more downtime in the holiday season, while today our resident video expert
[00:00:05] Kim Rippurg is going to show you how to make three different videos this holiday season
[00:00:09] to help get you more deals in 2025. Stay tuned!

[00:01:22] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage
[00:01:28] or team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents
[00:01:35] aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell
[00:01:39] you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you
[00:01:44] exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and
[00:01:50] which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting realtores
[00:01:56] for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool
[00:02:02] I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in
[00:02:08] your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that,
[00:02:13] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when
[00:02:19] I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my
[00:02:25] brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it
[00:02:30] every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:38] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now, onto the show.
[00:02:58] Hello, Kevina Rio. I am Kevina Rio. I'm excited to be back with you. Back with you, meaning I've done a lot of
[00:03:03] these episodes. So listen to the older ones. I am going to be talking about what you should make
[00:03:08] for the end of the year. And first, before I write in 2024, we are hosting a webinar, an amazing
[00:03:15] seminar all about how you grow your business in 2024. So me and the Keeping It Real Folks and
[00:03:22] a real estate coach is going to be amazing. So make sure to check that out at KeepingItRealWebinar.com.
[00:03:30] And you can contact with me on LinkedIn and Instagram at KimRitburn. So today, I want to talk about
[00:03:35] what we're going to be posting for the end of the year. It is December. Everyone's thinking about
[00:03:40] your end. And oh, a little bit about myself. I'm so rude. I'm not even introducing myself.
[00:03:47] My name is Kim. I'm a real estate video coach, meaning I help you be better on camera and figure
[00:03:52] out what you should make to grow your business. I say that specifically. If you're making video and
[00:03:57] you haven't gotten lens, call me. If you're not making video, call me. If you're making video and
[00:04:02] you've made video for years, there's further to go. If you're not finding clients every single week,
[00:04:07] call me. I'll help you figure that out. So I coach real estate agents across the country in one-on-one
[00:04:13] and group coaching. And so I love, love, love using my experience from media at Netflix,
[00:04:21] Inside Edition, Fox TV, Journalism to teach you how to be better on camera and make content
[00:04:27] that's interesting that brings in clients. So it is almost the end of the year. So what you should
[00:04:32] make. I don't want you just taking some other push person's video and copying it and saying,
[00:04:36] oh, 2024, goodbye, this is my video. The whole point of being on social media is to connect with
[00:04:43] existing clients and connect with potential new clients. What that means is the two C's, connection
[00:04:50] and credibility. Connection means remind people who you are, how amazing you are, how wonderfully
[00:04:57] you are, how committed you are, how dedicated you are, how you're going to get them the best you
[00:05:01] will possible. And credibility is posts that remind people you know what you're talking about.
[00:05:08] You have clients, you run a good team, you're dedicated, you actually like run a business,
[00:05:14] whether it's been one year or 30 years. So we're really focusing on those two C's, connection
[00:05:18] and credibility. So as you're thinking about the end of the year, you can lean into either one of
[00:05:23] those. So I'm going to show you what that really means. Okay. So in terms of connection,
[00:05:28] that can be personal things from the past year, right? Maybe you went to Disney with your family,
[00:05:33] maybe you moved into a new home, maybe you can do an end of the year, more personal thing.
[00:05:41] And now we want to talk about the credibility piece. You can share those professional wins.
[00:05:46] You with clients. So bring out your old footage from this year. You giving the key as soon
[00:05:52] you're new client, you cheering champion with a new client or existing client that you just
[00:05:58] helped them, right? So again, we're talking about celebrating those professional wins in the year
[00:06:04] end. So obviously you're on social media, you're a consumer. But if you're spending time consuming,
[00:06:10] I want you creating not just because you should and because you have to, but because your phone is
[00:06:16] a money maker. And if you're not using it to make money, you're making a mistake, you're leaving
[00:06:20] money on the table. So it's very, very important to realize the mindset shift of you can make money
[00:06:26] with your phone. I have clients across the country doing it. I have, I think honestly, only of the
[00:06:32] like agents that I've connected within the past month, I think between them, just a few of the agents
[00:06:37] have covered, I think it was like $7 million in sales, just a few of the agents of the many,
[00:06:43] many agents I've worked with in the past year, what I meant, million dollars in sales, specifically
[00:06:47] from video on social media, separate from regular in-person networking, cold calling, all that stuff.
[00:06:54] So number one, one of the end of the year videos I want you to make is a connection video.
[00:06:58] Just showing people what you've done, where you've been, and write it out, right? So show it
[00:07:03] visually, show where you've been. Maybe you went to Florida, maybe you went to Italy,
[00:07:08] ooh, save me some pasta. Maybe you had kind of a mountain, maybe you just stayed put and you relaxed.
[00:07:15] So make sure to like write that out. The reason why connection is so important is that you will
[00:07:21] start to notice the more you post, people connect with you on a human level, right? If you write,
[00:07:27] I went to Italy, they're going to be like, oh, I love Italy. Florence is my favorite place.
[00:07:32] And so often the more haunting you'll put out, you'll have more insights, more information, more
[00:07:37] numbers to compare, and you're like, oh, that posted really well. That's cool. So you will start
[00:07:43] noticing those things. So another thing, a professional wins video. So that can just be, I have some
[00:07:49] agents who I love when they do that at the end of the year, they'll write the total number of sales,
[00:07:54] total dollar amount of sales they've done that year. Awesome. You should definitely do that. I think
[00:07:58] that's a great concept. But really highlight how you helped people, right? So just I love the not
[00:08:05] humility in it, but really like the service aspect of, you know, just close X and sales. So proud
[00:08:12] to have helped people find their dream home, their vacation home, whatever. So those are two ideas.
[00:08:19] Now let's talk about New Year's resolutions, right? Everybody at the end of December is like,
[00:08:24] what's the next year you're going to bring to 2025? So you can do a New Year's resolutions post.
[00:08:30] That can be anything you want it to be. So if you're somebody who likes to share more
[00:08:33] personally, you can put out your personal resolutions. If you'd like to keep it more professionally
[00:08:38] focused, you can make a New Year's resolutions post. Something that you and your team,
[00:08:45] things that you're working on. Remember, it does not mean it doesn't show you. I have sometimes
[00:08:50] clients are like, if I say people what I'm working on, they'll think I'm not good at what I'm
[00:08:53] already doing. No, no, no. All of us know, even if you're an expert at something you are doing,
[00:08:58] we're all growing and learning. Like I have coaches for all these different things. I have a
[00:09:03] speaking coach, a business coach. We all have coaches and people who help us. We all have things
[00:09:08] we're working on in a good way to grow. So make sure to share, is it you, is it your team? What are
[00:09:14] some things you plan to be building on for 2024? And so that can be a post. So New Year's resolution
[00:09:20] post. Speaking about that, the credibility piece of the New Year, so number one, just a recap.
[00:09:31] Number one, we have the year in review type of video, right? The yearly wrap up year in review.
[00:09:37] It can be more professional or more personal or both, right? Put them a couple days apart.
[00:09:43] And then secondly, we have the resolutions. It can be what you and your team is doing. Several
[00:09:48] of my clients have people working for them and they want to showcase them as well, which is really
[00:09:52] smart. So you can have a video where you're all talking about New Year's resolutions. Things
[00:09:59] people are saying, you know, different types of new technology. Others are trying to go back to
[00:10:02] basics, with calls. So that's the second video you can make as resolutions. The third video I want
[00:10:09] you to think about is those two C's. Credibility and connection. Credibility. That means you are an
[00:10:16] expert. You are the go-to person in your neighborhood people can trust. I want you to say what you see
[00:10:22] coming in for 2025. So I want to see your prognostication. I don't get to say that word enough.
[00:10:29] Prognostication. You're forecast for 2025. So for me, I've been working on AI more. So something that
[00:10:37] I'm going to be talking about and teaching about in 2025. I already was at 2024, but I'm going to
[00:10:42] continue teaching it. The fast company innovation festival. I spoke about it. One of my predictions,
[00:10:49] prognostications forecast for 2025 is AI and how to leverage it in a way that you're getting
[00:10:55] efficient, but you're not losing your human touch. So that's something that I would do for my
[00:10:59] business. But for you, you can say 2025, either what you see in the market, but also what you see in
[00:11:06] your neighborhood, right? You're the expert in your neighborhood. So that's an important thing that
[00:11:10] you can be doing. So for 2025, we could be talking about a market, like a look ahead at the market,
[00:11:16] or a look ahead in your neighborhood. So I live in Brooklyn. There's new development
[00:11:21] up the wazoo in certain parts. Others have no movement, right? The very tight market. So maybe
[00:11:28] you're talking about new areas, new builds, new, just trends you're seeing. And if you love some of
[00:11:34] my clients love design, you could talk about designs that you expect to be seeing come in. Again,
[00:11:39] lean into what you love. You know, some of my agents love design, some of my agents love like the
[00:11:44] nitty-gritty, the deal, some of them love the deal. So just really lean into what you love and what
[00:11:49] you know, but put yourself as that credible expert. You're holding your hand, but you're guiding
[00:11:54] them and you're advising them. All right, I love keeping these short, not because I talk fast,
[00:12:00] because I know people are busy, but really importantly, make sure to follow me on social media.
[00:12:06] Kim, K-I-M, R-I-T-T-B-E-R-G. Tell me you heard me on Giving It Real. I love love love. They keep
[00:12:11] me real folks. I've been working with so many of them. I'm email friends with them. And don't forget,
[00:12:16] I have a free download of tips for videos. So video-free video tips download, how you can make
[00:12:23] video that makes you money. And additionally, I'm on Instagram and I'm on LinkedIn and do not forget
[00:12:30] to sign up for our Keeping It Real webinar. Whenever that's live, keep it realwebinar.com. If that's not
[00:12:37] live yet, just drop me a lot, drop me a link. And I will have you sign up for that as soon as it's live,
[00:12:41] but that's going to be right after the new year and it's going to get you completely ready to
[00:12:45] crush 2025 be the leader in your market. Anyway, I hope you're having an amazing holiday season.
[00:12:51] I forgot to say this at the beginning. If you're not watching me on the video, I'm wearing
[00:12:54] red lipstick and I got sequins on my blazer. I'm totally in the holiday spirit. I hope you guys
[00:12:58] have an amazing holiday and keep up the good work. Keep crushing it on camera.
