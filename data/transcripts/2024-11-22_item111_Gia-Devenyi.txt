[00:03:53] Thank you so much for having me DJ. I really appreciate the invite and excited to be here.
[00:04:00] Well, I learned about you at an event, which was like a month or a month or two ago at an A&N mortgage and they had you speak on a panel and you were so outstanding.
[00:04:14] I was like, I got to get I have to get you on our podcast. So welcome. We're excited to have you and I'm just excited to have another local Chicago person on who I have.
[00:04:23] I don't have a lot of Chicago people on these days. So this is really fun for me and our listeners are going to really appreciate what you have to talk about. But let's let's start with your story. So how and why did you get into real estate?
[00:04:35] Sure. Well, it was a long, long time ago DJ.
[00:04:43] Okay, so basically it really was a long time ago on I was 20. I was honestly around like 2021 years old.
[00:04:51] And my father was getting into flipping properties. So essentially he was an investor and he kept nudging me to get my real estate license and honestly it really did not sound that desirable to me at the time I was a little bit young, possibly a bit immature.
[00:05:15] What a 21 year old who's immature. That's impossible.
[00:05:19] I know right. So it's crazy. So like so I'm I didn't go to I didn't go to college and I was aspiring to be a tennis player right.
[00:05:30] Yeah.
[00:05:34] But I knew that you know I had to have some other options out there and my dad did keep kind of dangling the carrot and saying, hey, look, I'm starting to purchase a lot of properties.
[00:05:46] It'd be so cool as my daughter to be the listing agent.
[00:05:49] And like I could really get you into this and we really started off on the investor side of things. So before I actually got licensed, I actually used to be a almost like a photographer for my dad, but a different kind of photographer, not the one that goes and takes beautiful pictures of homes.
[00:06:08] It was a little bit different because these were for share of sales and my dad used to take me to the options and we used to bid on properties and this is right back in 2006.
[00:06:26] So I'm sure you know where this might be going.
[00:06:29] 
[00:06:29] Yeah.
[00:06:30] The good old recession. So I agreed to get my license in 2006. Finally, I did.
[00:06:38] And as it happened, the market crashed and I was about 22 years old and it was, it was unexplainable to me, meaning as I just didn't understand how to navigate it.
[00:06:53] I was so young. What do I do now? Yeah.
[00:06:56] Totally. It was like, what do I do now?
[00:06:58] And it was interesting to say the least. So I started off in the industry like that. I was actually a suburb agent in Naperville.
[00:07:07] I did a lot of the western suburbs. I did a lot of the southern suburbs as well.
[00:07:14] And you know, it was just a whole different market than where I am right now. But I will say this. I did learn a lot.
[00:07:22] My parents always said to me, if you can stick this out, Jeeha, how many years it will be. I never predicted how many years that recession was going to be.
[00:07:31] A lot of tears were shed.
[00:07:34] But it was definitely one of those things that I'm really grateful that I listened to my parents and I stuck through it.
[00:07:42] And they're like, if you do this, you will come out on top.
[00:07:46] But you know, I do believe that because of the recession and the age I was at getting into it.
[00:07:54] It kind of, I don't want to say it like set me back a little bit, but I feel like my career didn't really get started until I came to the city, which was like in 2000 and almost 13.
[00:08:05] So you basically did like almost a reverse move, right? A lot of people here in Chicago, they, they're here in the city and in their early 20s. They have city life. They love it. And then like, I want to go have more space and be out in the burbs.
[00:08:19] And I think that's the most certainly the flight out there. And I like that you did the reverse flight because I'm a city person as well. So I very much appreciate that.
[00:08:26] And do you do enjoy selling more? And again, I know you sell not just in the city. Of course you go where your clients need you.
[00:08:33] Do you prefer to sell not not that ones better than the other, but is it more fun to sell in the suburbs in the city? What do you like to do?
[00:08:40] Yeah, I mean, like I'll be honest, like it's so fast paced out here in the city. This was always my, my vibe.
[00:08:47] When I was, I had a wonderful managing broker who was like, who was my, my mentor at Ryan Hill Realty. It was called back in Napier Bell. And he always said to me, gee, what are you doing? You need to be in the city or city girl. And I'm like, Jack, I'm old.
[00:09:02] Like I'm at the time of be like 27. You know, like everyone's so I know I know I look back and I'm like, what am I thinking? But it's just like, you know, I you see all these people that are starting to move back to like 29 3031 32 have kids. And I just really didn't think that I don't know I doubted myself honestly. And yeah, I got to the city super fast pace. I loved it.
[00:09:25] These past 10, 11, 12 years, whatever it's been, have been amazing. And but I will say this.
[00:09:33] I do not mind going to the suburbs and pulling into a driveway.
[00:09:39] Sure.
[00:09:39] Some kind of nice love it. Yeah.
[00:09:41] Yeah. And like, you know, like the, the rides are kind of meditative. And so I don't, I don't mind doing that at all. But I think if I was to pick one market over the other.
[00:09:51] Yeah. So I would I'm going to be a city agent all the way as long as I can tell, but I'm as long as it's a future.
[00:09:59] Yeah, I feel the same way I'm a city I've been living here for almost 20, I think 24, 25 years in the city. And I'm certainly open to moving wherever if I ever have to.
[00:10:10] But, but, but I prefer the city. But there's funny thing that people who don't live in the city of Chicago wouldn't know is that people who live in the city, especially women have this even I think more so than men obviously is this like there's always a little bit of like a little bit of fear and a little bit of danger.
[00:10:26] We live in Chicago. We always have that. And I live in wicker park. You're in Avondale, both nice areas. And there's always still a little bit of like looking over my shoulder at night.
[00:10:36] But it is a lot of fun. And there's a lot to do. And you know, I just walked outside on the Milwaukee this weekend and went to a comedy show like 10 steps more I live.
[00:10:44] You know, so you can't really beat that. But I do love pulling into a driveway when I visit my friends as well and say, oh, this is what a home looks like. I keep forgetting what what real homes look like.
[00:10:53] Yeah. But let's let's talk about making that transition from the suburbs to the city because it doesn't necessarily mean that your clients are also moving into the city or you know those are kind of could be two sort of separate worlds obviously people who live in the suburbs know people who live in the city.
[00:11:10] But was that a difficult transition just to find clientele when he moved in.
[00:11:13] I was honestly just like probably one of the hardest times in my life on I yeah, because I didn't have any clientele in the city. I really didn't and like I was I was honestly I was going through a breakup and it was like a really long term relationship and I kind of like just I like broke my lease early from I was living in Lyle and like broke up with my boyfriend then broke my lease and my main my manager broker was talking about this.
[00:11:43] I meant to encourage me like go now. So I did and I literally didn't have anything to bring with me and I'll be real with you. I did not have like a savvy CRM from in a lot of us.
[00:11:57] I think didn't either at that time really like things were just a lot different than they were. I don't was Instagram around. I think it was but it was like barely for being artsy, which you know I would post like cool pictures. Right. But right.
[00:12:11] So you know I think yes, sorry, I like to really talk a lot, but yes, you're so you're so nailed it on the high like it was difficult. It was so hard for me. I struggled. I was I was honestly I was really broke. I I had to learn the hard way and it really it really took a while for me to be able to get my feet on the ground with things.
[00:12:38] I had to make literally all new friends. I had some friends that were from my high school that still in the city, but you know I was going through that breakup and that breakup was actually a friend from my high school.
[00:12:49] Oh no.
[00:12:51] So I lost a lot of front. Yeah, you know that complicates things. Yeah.
[00:12:56] And it's just and again, like where I was doing the the opposite effect thing where I'm coming in and they're moving back. It's like it just it wasn't I don't know. I think I I couldn't have done it honestly at the worst time and
[00:13:12] that's okay because I feel like it really it you go through those obstacles and those are what really makes you stronger. I think as a person as an agent. I know what it's like to have it kind of rough.
[00:13:24] And I honestly think that the time I finally actually started really seeing some really great results was when I decided to I got asked to join a team with and this team that was leaving their their brokerage they were going to add properties and I actually knew one of the guys on the team I know them for many, many years back from neighbor bill actually was a friend.
[00:13:51] And they asked me to join the team. I ran with it and ever since that day I said I will never say no to anything I'm going to hustle I I will go to St Charles Illinois and do it ever after the I'll go back to the field I will do whatever I have to do to take leads like I
[00:14:09] And then I also said I will materialize them that was another thing because I had the experience I wasn't a new agent you know so
[00:14:17] That was really when when things started to really start working out for me was when I did that I had some camaraderie from the team and it really just it really felt good.
[00:14:28] What were some of the things that you did to help lead generation I know sometimes when you're a team sometimes your fed leads of course that's one of the nice benefits but also you know you're generating your own book of business too so how did you how did you do that with not a huge fear of influence you know you said pretty much people were like you know ships in the night you're people you knew we're moving the opposite way that you were it's not like you could you wouldn't go out and help them of course you would what you're not as present in their life at that point maybe in that you know they see it was a city person now maybe.
[00:14:58] So how did you but you were like i'm going to go everywhere and get is get all the leads I can because why not and you know how did you do that just out of curiosity.
[00:15:07] Yep so okay so yes not only did I just say yes to lead like when okay so for example there would be.
[00:15:16] At properties had their app that had just come out and I saw that people be like how do you want this lead you want this lead i'm not kidding I would be sitting here like this waiting until this like like I had I don't even know if you can have notifications i'm like high set but like I was just like.
[00:15:33] me me me and I would give this whole explanation how I have been an agent for this money I mean I took so much time into every explanation I would be all over the Facebook leads like I would see something come on.
[00:15:47] Hey i'm a buyer looking for first person i would reach out then I would DM them then I would.
[00:15:53] message them again like I was i was obsessed with it I literally wouldn't leave people alone I mean but I made sure I did it in a and then I sure was it's you know that wasn't too overbearing but I was very much responsive and on top of things and very consistent.
[00:16:11] And then once I started actually getting some business from that I always kept up with my clients from there I knew that these were probably going to be my bread and butter for the future I learned that the hard way from not taking anybody over from from neighbor bill I all these people I did close which I had closings when I was younger I didn't follow what that's that was a that's a problem by the way thank you for thank you for owning that.
[00:16:41] And and being vulnerable and admitting that because every single person on this call has is not perfect and we've all let clients fall by the wayside and it's something that it's very unfortunate and also very relatable and it happens.
[00:16:56] It it happens and you know what it's okay and as long as you learn from it eventually and then don't do that anymore because it's not helping your business and then don't bitch that you're not getting any referrals you know.
[00:17:12] But one thing I wanted to say was I really started doing a ton of open houses I set open houses for my team all the time like I mean sometimes I sat for open houses for the same property if my if my team we had a he had a lot of new development so I would I was like oh my gosh one and a half million dollar listing gas please I'm like i'll do it with just the studs in and I yeah yeah exactly right of course.
[00:17:39] You know and like all you need is that one person to come by and just maybe say hey look we happen to just be in the neighborhood and it's happened so that's that was a huge way for me to start getting business was doing open houses helping out with showings getting to know the buildings oh my gosh that was huge like that was a big thing because you didn't really have high rises and stuff like that.
[00:18:09] There was only single family homes in neighbor mostly you know.
[00:18:13] There are agents here in Chicago and in other metropolitan big metropolitan areas that literally make their good chunk of their career in one building or two buildings.
[00:18:23] Michael Rosenbloom's done that I've done an interview with him many many years ago he's king of that there's a number of agents that that have done that and so I want to talk about the one that you have done that with which is which is called the Metropolitan Place it's a high rise here in Chicago but tell us about how you got to do it.
[00:18:39] So I'm not into that building and how you started to develop relationships so that you became the agent of choice.
[00:18:47] 100% so I love that building so much by the way it's like it's just got a part of my heart and the reason why is because that's the home that I grew up in and I say that because when I was I was actually dating somebody and they really wanted to move that way and I really didn't want to and I
[00:19:09] pushed back on it and he was like no we got a move here fine so we end up moving in a metropolitan place and it was such a cool like city law it was like something that you just like kind of see out of the movie or you are something that you have like a vision of in your head when you're like younger like like when I was like in 1996 and I was like 12 or 13 and I'm like I just gave away my age great.
[00:19:30] Sorry shoot but in 1996 you know you're thinking like oh my god I want to live in the city in this loft and that was what it was basically so I ended up living there for about six and a half years and even though I was a renter in there I was a renter I was not I was not an owner nobody knew and so I know they invited me to okay so they invited me to all of their
[00:19:59] community events and they're like oh my gosh yeah you're so fun why don't you be part of the social committee and by and by the way we should mention to anyone listening that's not normally what they invite renters to do anything related to the building because of course that's for owners but they liked you and said come on by.
[00:20:17] Yeah they liked me and I was like honestly really into throwing parties so I was like hey let's we should do this we should bring my amp because I like I used to play play music and stuff and I had a bunch of different amps and like oh no we need like light as party up you know and so I would like suggest different types of catering and music and this and that and come up with all the ideas so they were super intrigued by it and it really was bringing the community together and that was really like the biggest step for me.
[00:20:46] And so after I stayed in there was there was just I was right there into that building was just becoming friends with a lot of the neighbors and then basically what happened was that boy forgot kicked out and and the new one moved in so and then that became my husband actually
[00:21:03] So my husband, I met him in metropolitan place.
[00:21:07] I know.
[00:21:08] His, that his somebody he worked with, they were my, they were my next door neighbor.
[00:21:14] And we basically just kind of like, I don't want to say you brand the building, but like we were just friends with everybody.
[00:21:21] And then I tried making an offer three different times with the owner on our place.
[00:21:26] I really wanted to buy it and live there.
[00:21:28] And they don't want to sell it yet. And they still haven't sold it. They're still renting it.
[00:21:32] But after that time, I was like, oh my gosh, I need to be in this building somehow, whether I'm going to live here later on or just sell the shit out of it.
[00:21:42] You know, so I kept in communication with everybody.
[00:21:46] And before you know it, I started getting one listing another listing another listing and rentals. I'll do anything rental listings by or whatever.
[00:21:56] And I have such a great core connection with them everybody that it actually helps within the network to like pitch that to other sellers.
[00:22:05] For, you know, in case I had like an in house buyer and house listing or whatever it might be right or pocket listing.
[00:22:13] So I think that I.
[00:22:17] I didn't really have to try that hard. It really was just about being part of like a lifestyle really.
[00:22:23] I kind of just made it my lifestyle. And that's really how it happened. It was super organic.
[00:22:29] But you know, like now I do send out marketing material, but I don't feel weird doing it.
[00:22:37] Where I'm like begging or asking for a business, I probably shouldn't say like that, but I don't feel that I'm asking for a business.
[00:22:43] They already know who I am. And every journey where they expect to get this booklet from me.
[00:22:49] And it basically states a whole market update of the whole year, everything that I've sold a little bit about my life.
[00:22:56] How I'm how I met my husband there. I have my dog was born there. You know, like it.
[00:23:02] Oh, so it's exclusive. It's exclusive to the building.
[00:23:05] Just to them only just to them early.
[00:23:09] And I do happy hours with them to like, I mean, just like literally I will shoot out little messages to the building.
[00:23:17] I mean, I know so many people there. So I just I have a personal email. I'll say, Hey, you want to go do a little happy hour over at the Mariano's in Los Aluf.
[00:23:25] You know, like, that's so funny because we're like, it's a grocery store, but that's actually where we used to go and hang out.
[00:23:30] It's what was like old times, you know, and just just really easy simple stuff.
[00:23:35] They still invite me to their community events and stuff. It's I'm really lucky.
[00:23:41] Yeah, it looks like it sounds like to me that you married kind of your passion to this opportunity. It was like, Oh, I like doing this.
[00:23:49] I like being of service. I like throwing, you know, social events and I like being helpful there.
[00:23:55] And so you just, you know, all of those buildings are always looking for people to help with those things because nobody wants to help.
[00:24:01] I know like the building I'm at. I will not be joining the board, but I also don't complain about anything. So I think that's a fair deal.
[00:24:08] I go, thank you for the board. Whatever, you know, whatever decisions you guys make. I won't complain. But I'm also not going to, I'm not going to do my time.
[00:24:15] I've done that before and learned my lesson. But, but if I was a practicing agent, I would totally be doing that because great opportunity to, and I'll give you just for anyone listening.
[00:24:27] You just reminded me of a really simple idea that I think a lot of agents forget. And I'll give you use myself as an example.
[00:24:35] So I live in a building called Alcove. It's in Wicker Park. Anyway, our audience won't know what that is. But anyway, it's a relatively new development like four years old maybe three three to four years old. I've lived there since the beginning.
[00:24:45] I can tell you the number of physical marketing materials that have shown up in my inbox from other agents. Literally, there's 46,000 REALTORS in the Chicago land area, including the suburbs.
[00:24:58] I have gotten zero, not one in four years. And I don't think it's because people know I'm in the business. They would be farming everyone in the in the building. So that is a crazy thing to say.
[00:25:10] Like I am shocked. Now I understand two people who move into new construction usually don't leave it with three years. But it would be a great time to start building a relationship with a, with a, with a, you know, a possible future seller.
[00:25:21] At some point, I'm probably going to move out of there and, you know, and, and cry because my interest rate is so low and I'm going to lose it. But the point is is, yeah, people have moved out of our building who were only there a year or two, you know, life got in the way for whatever they transfer jobs or some.
[00:25:37] But I am shocked. I am still today. I've been talking about this for years on my podcast. Not one person has ever sent me a piece of mail. Is that that is so there.
[00:25:47] What we're talking about is really what you were doing is you were, obviously, and you still do it. You're still putting material together for a building or for people listening could be a neighborhood. It could be a community. It could be, it could be really anything that you're interested in.
[00:26:01] But just to give people an idea that if you think all of all of these places are being farmed, my building has not been far once and we are, we are a building that should be farmed because we have some good, good sellers in there that, you know, have some high priced.
[00:26:16] And it's just places. So it's it's shocking to me, but that's how much opportunity there is. Yeah, it is crazy. Right. So you could become the alkova person if you want to.
[00:26:26] I know I'm like, just wait till you see next month in your mail. It'll be.
[00:26:30] Yeah, but I love that. So this idea of just staying top of mind with this that with that building that you're with and being still being a part of it.
[00:26:39] And also, you know, continuing to add value by sending out by putting those booklets together for that. I mean, that's that's a wonderful thing.
[00:26:47] Yeah, for four years, too, it's been consistent. Like just something to the viewers really quick that are maybe even like newer agents and stuff. I know some people like feel like, I did mailers for like six months or years.
[00:26:59] Whatever, that's not going to work. You might get lucky. I don't know. I never did, but I can tell you what, I after four years in a row, I've been gone from that building. This I've been in an annual four years.
[00:27:12] I haven't stopped once like every single month they do get a mailer and at every single January of the last four years or five, maybe even they get the booklet. So it's consistency.
[00:27:24] And what I love about that is it's every every 30 days and whether they just look at the, you know, the postcard or thing. Of course, yeah, and that's that's okay. We don't even care if they, of course, they're going to throw it out.
[00:27:39] But at least they're going to see your picture and your name before they throw it out, right? It's like, there's the thing of GSM. Okay, cool. And they toss it, but they see you and they remember they reminded they're reminded of what you are or what you do and who you are.
[00:27:52] So I think it is a great, great idea. And I'm shocked that more agents aren't doing that. I know doing mailers is expensive and it also maybe seems a bit antiquated.
[00:28:03] But I'm telling you, people aren't reading their emails. That's the other thing I would love to do a podcast called nobody reads your emails because nobody reads their emails because I know nobody does.
[00:28:13] It's either text message or physical mail, those are the only things that are actually consistently getting looked at. And even text messages goofy now because, you know, people, there's all such a spam on text message is a little harder to do.
[00:28:27] But, but yeah, so I love that. And it works, but you're right. You have to do it for, for at least a couple of years. Yeah. And you have to be willing just to eat the cost for a bit and realize maybe one transaction is going to pay for the year anyway.
[00:28:42] Exactly. Exactly. That's the kind of mindset you have to have. You just have to kind of go with it.
[00:28:47] You know, and if, if you don't want to pay for that all by yourself on a monthly or whatever, maybe there are options out there that you can work out with, maybe partnering with one of your lenders and seeing if they'd be willing to put the cost to.
[00:29:03] Yeah, let I would, I want to talk about just sort of your sense, this is something I don't ever talk about. And I think I think it's a fun thing to talk about is you are somebody who I suspect is often told how great your fashion sense is.
[00:29:23] You have your very intentional about your dress. You have a really unique style that that is is very cool, at least, you know, to me and not a lot of other people say the same thing about you.
[00:29:33] How, how much fun is it to sort of marry your style of, of, you know, sort of dress with work like it seems like that's something that you really truly enjoy.
[00:29:43] Oh my gosh, it's like the best question ever.
[00:29:48] So I love fashion so much on. Yes, I used to watch the 19 like in 1990, 1991, I used to watch all of the Donna Karen and D. Canway runway models, like I was like obsessed my, I mean, I would be like sitting in even Marcus just like waiting for my mom in the dressing room while she was trying on clothes forever.
[00:30:11] And I did not mind I would just like look at everything. I just I am obsessed with fashion. My favorite color is leopard, by the way, I know, right.
[00:30:21] Yeah, but no, I got to say this like I feel like that's one thing that might maybe like actually be something unique that might stop me aside from 100% some other agents. I'm not really the most typical dressing looking agent.
[00:30:40] And I am, I am very professional and I'm, but I'm, I believe in being just yourself and I love colors. I love colors. I like black. I love jewelry. I love hair. I'm big into lipstick. I just love having a very eclectic look.
[00:31:00] And I think that you can have an edgy eclectic look, being in a professional setting still.
[00:31:10] And you don't have to just wear, you know, just to suit all the time or just to dress all the time. I think there is a way to still have your fashion sense and your style and incorporate that into your showings or whatever it may be.
[00:31:29] Yeah, I think it really works for you too because it definitely feels authentic to you. Right. So when I, when I've seen you in person, I'm like, oh, yeah, that she's very intentional about her dress. It's very cool. It's unique. And probably it's part of your brand. And I think there's, there's nothing inherently negative about that. I know sometimes people want to, you know, obviously your professionalism, your skill level, all of the things you do are really the most important part. But it's nice to have a really intentional aesthetic and you do.
[00:31:57] And I think that that's something that a lot of agents could really think about what is my aesthetic, even if it's maybe if it's more conservative, more, more, you know, more edgy, whatever it might be, you know, really be intentional about that.
[00:32:10] People remember how people are dressed. I mean, they really do. I want to go back all the way back to you at the beginning, you talked about really wanting to become a tennis pro.
[00:32:20] And I just got back from, well, not just about a few months ago, I went to the US Open out in out in flushing. Yeah. So it was my second year in a row going. Yeah, so much fun.
[00:32:30] So, and that was, yeah, it's, by the way, if anyone ever has an opportunity to go out to the US Open, if you're in New York, you've probably already done that if you live there.
[00:32:39] But if you haven't, it's a great opportunity to really see some, some wonderful tennis and just got to get a sense of, of what that the US Open really is, which is really a lot of fun.
[00:32:48] But I'm curious about when you were playing, I'm a tennis player as well. But when you were, when you started in tennis and you really were going to make this your career, it's a tremendous amount of discipline like any other sport.
[00:32:58] So can you talk a little bit about the amount of work that you were putting into it and did that translate over into once you were, you know, a real estate agent did those skills kind of kind of transfer over.
[00:33:09] Yeah, so that is a whole other part of my life. It basically was my life, the whole first probably at least the first 15 to 17 years of my life.
[00:33:22] Yeah, so basically I was a US T A tennis player, a US T junior national tennis player.
[00:33:28] I, from the time I remember since I was about maybe like six years old, I started when I was about four, but when I was probably about six or seven is when things had to really get serious, like I literally was sat down by my parents.
[00:33:42] I have, I have the European tennis parents, my dad's from Hungary, my mom's from Italy. So, you know, they have the dreams, right, they come to America, it's like, okay, we have our tonner and maybe she'll be a tennis pro.
[00:33:53] I don't know, but basically I had to have a very serious talk with them and I was about six and a half.
[00:33:59] I remember I was in a car with them and they're like, you have to choose, you want tennis or you want to be a figure skater because I was doing both and I chose tennis.
[00:34:08] So, I've ever since six and a half, I basically just trained every single day and I was always going after school, I was picked up straight to tennis.
[00:34:22] I get a 10 private tennis lesson and then I would have a group tennis training, which would usually be around anywhere from like an hour private to like three hours of training afterwards.
[00:34:34] It was pretty consistent like that all the way up until high school when you become like 12 or 13 is really when it's like serious and my parents wanted to send me to the to the Voltaire.
[00:34:46] Sure down in Florida.
[00:34:49] Yeah, and it was a little scary because I was 12 when I had another serious talk with them and they really wanted to take, they really wanted to take it to another level.
[00:34:59] I was, you know, nationally ranked, it was one of those things where you either just do it full time at that point, you know, you shut off everything else in your life and you just go for it.
[00:35:13] I wasn't ready to do it.
[00:35:15] I was really, I cried a lot about it and I want to do it.
[00:35:18] I didn't want to leave my parents.
[00:35:20] Like I was, I don't even know, but it was friends as much.
[00:35:23] I just like didn't want to leave my parents.
[00:35:25] Well, what 12 year old does, I mean, I know, it's a big ask, it's a big ask for someone.
[00:35:31] It's just a big ask and like, you know, but I, but here's the thing.
[00:35:37] It really brought so much routine and discipline to my life now and you ask like, how do I apply it to or how have I applied it to my real state life and.
[00:35:47] You know, my biggest, my biggest thing that I think that I am, that I have a strength in is my, my wellness routine.
[00:35:56] I've always been into working out.
[00:35:58] I mean, I used to have a personal trainer at the age of eight.
[00:36:02] I don't know if people would frown upon that now, but back then, if people really did it, whatever.
[00:36:07] So I, I had a personal trainer. I was consistently always working out, always eating healthy.
[00:36:15] I mean, I was always thinking about what I have to eat and it was, it's, it hasn't changed, honestly.
[00:36:22] And now I think the fact that I'm able to wake up early in the morning and I can get things done. I have a schedule.
[00:36:32] I, I still love to work out. It helps to stress me.
[00:36:36] I love being a coach for my team. I've been coached my whole life.
[00:36:43] And I, I don't know, I think that it just really helps, but also with, with when I'm with my clients, I mean, I love being super competitive for them.
[00:36:53] If we're going into a multiple offer situation or maybe not even a multiple offer, just knowing that there's a hot property and they want it, like I want to get it for them.
[00:37:02] So it's, it's almost like to me, I look at it as, it's like a match every time I'm, I'm going out into the field with them.
[00:37:10] I want to do the best I can for them. I'm, I'm sure that's got to do with something with how I play tennis.
[00:37:17] Well, yeah, you just had, you had to do a lot of activity. You had to be intentional about your food and your, and your schedule and, you know, your exercise and all of that is, is just being really in setting up an intentional kind of life where you're like, this is what I do.
[00:37:33] And maybe it was done for you when you were little because that's, you know, that's how it works. But as an adult, you know, it's, I think a lot of us could benefit from really thinking about building.
[00:37:43] It's sort of like letting things happen and, and just kind of going, well, I should do this. I should do that is like literally sitting down and saying, let's design my, my diet or let's design my, my health regimen or let's design my marketing practice for finding new clients and not just kind of flying by the emails that come in and responding to text messages and all of the sort of what we need to deal with us right in front of us that can feel really productive and technically is productive for our existing clients.
[00:38:12] And whatever is urgent in the moment, but this idea of planning in advance, I mean, you talked about like nutrition, like for me, I figured this out many years ago that maybe it's just me and other people wouldn't struggle as much with this.
[00:38:24] But I realized if I didn't plan my lunch before I left for the day, if I didn't bring a lunch or plan my lunch, I was going to make a bad decision for lunch.
[00:38:33] So I was, I was literally going to make an unhealthy decision. And so I'm like, well, I can't trust myself to make a good health decision in the moment because I might be stressed out, I might be wanting to escape, I might be just feeling crummy, whatever.
[00:38:46] And you know fast food looks pretty good when you're stressed out. So I, and I, and you know, so what I do is I plan my meals out, I batch cook, I do those things, not because I'm like so brilliant. It's because I have such a weak, you know, self control.
[00:39:01] And so I think that's part of it too is is thinking about like what are you good at, what aren't you good at. And you know, because for you lifestyle is everything. So you are intentional about your stuff, but I'm sure there's parts of your business that you aren't good at or that you don't enjoy doing.
[00:39:17] And can you talk about sort of how you get through those tasks or do you delegate or do you, you know, team members help.
[00:39:23] So what are, what are the things that about because everyone has parts of their business if they're doing it all themselves, they're like, I'm not good at it. I don't like it.
[00:39:31] I mean, honestly, that's to me, like that's like one of the biggest things to realize in order to become a successful agent. You do need to realize what you don't love to do in your business and you do need to realize what your strengths are in your business, what you like to do.
[00:39:43] Because if you are doing those things that you don't love all the time, you're going to get burnt out.
[00:39:49] And some of those things for me were a lot of the paperwork. I really wasn't enjoying to do those anymore because as your business grows and you now have, you know, 8 to 10 to 12 to 14 to 15 listings and then buyers.
[00:40:02] Now you're like, OK, this is a lot of stuff to do and you're not able to give your clients as great of service because you're thinking about how you have to upload.
[00:40:12] Disclosure, you know, to your deal management system or whatever it is.
[00:40:16] So one of those things that I decided to do a few years ago was I decided to hire a transaction manager.
[00:40:21] And it's literally that's changed my life. So that has been a huge thing for me as far as getting things organized on that end.
[00:40:31] And then, I did you sorry.
[00:40:34] And then for my team, with them, they've been helping me a lot on my showing.
[00:40:41] So for a lot of my listings, I they do assist me on being at those showings.
[00:40:46] I try to have an agent at every single showing for my listings.
[00:40:51] Obviously things do come up, right?
[00:40:53] I mean, our settlers do get books sometimes, but I tried to have somebody always at the showings open houses. I'll be very real with you.
[00:41:00] I did not love doing open houses. I really don't.
[00:41:02] And I think that after putting in a little over 17 years, I think that I kind of get to say if I want to do an open house or not really or by feel like it.
[00:41:13] And just so you know, I always set my clients expectations with this.
[00:41:17] And if someone really wants me to be at an open house, of course, we'll do it for them.
[00:41:21] But my agents are amazing and they are very hungry to do open houses and they do them all the time.
[00:41:29] So I usually have them do my open houses for my listings. So I think those are two.
[00:41:36] Those are probably two I think of my biggest things right there are really the transaction management side and open houses.
[00:41:43] Yeah, transaction management is interesting because it you know, for a good transaction coordinator, just for even one transaction, you can hire people to do individual deals.
[00:41:53] It's pretty affordable. I found it's like usually on 500 bucks or less and you only pay for closes and yeah, you know, the quality can vary depending on who you get.
[00:42:03] But you can find some decent people eventually you have somebody you hire somebody and they're you know, they're your person and that's even better.
[00:42:10] And the other thing I wanted to also mention is these open houses. So you know, it's funny because you know, you talk about your top producer, you're busy and open houses take time.
[00:42:21] And there's just a lot to do with them and you've been doing them for 17 years. You're like, okay, you know, maybe it's maybe I can off offload or delegate those to some of my team members because they're the ones that probably need leads more than even I do for which is really what open houses, you know, quite frankly do more than anything is hopefully provide some buyer leads.
[00:42:39] Hopefully for that property, but probably for any property because they're people walking in. So this is something that if I were an agent and I were in your office and I didn't have any listings, I would be begging and pleading with you.
[00:42:51] Please, please, please let me do an open house and you know, I probably have to earn that the right for you to say, okay, you can do one.
[00:42:59] And it's something that I want all of our listeners to consider doing if there's anyone in your office with a listing, beg and plead with them to help, you know, help you, you know, set up an open house and you know see because it's going to help them to the owner.
[00:43:12] The owner is going to think they're doing something great for that property. It's going to help you as the agent because you're going to learn how to talk to people about real estate and about a particular property and and also it's.
[00:43:23] Yeah, it's just a great way to get leads. So I think that's awesome. I think that's fantastic and and you know begging and you were talking about this when you joined a team you were like, I was doing a lot of open houses because the team had.
[00:43:34] All the time, all the time, it was just and it was just such a good way to to be able to.
[00:43:41] To feel busy like, you know, especially as being a new agent, it's like, I don't know why I just feel like I loved filling up my weekends with having all of this to do.
[00:43:52] And then I at the same time, I remember thinking, wait, I'm also learning how to do this even better and learning these buildings like going up and down some of these high rise like I now know where the amenities are.
[00:44:03] I know where this is and you're and you're practicing saying your spiel. I mean, there's a lot to say when you're walking into a condor, people are asking questions about reserves and this and that, you know, it's like you it's it's all practice.
[00:44:17] So I think it's a great way for you to be able to practice because they don't teach you this stuff in real estate school.
[00:44:24] Yeah, yeah, so everyone listening open houses still work. They are super effective and they, you know, you do you have to do a lot of them though you don't do one and expect, you know, five buyers to walk in.
[00:44:36] They may or may not, but you do 100 open houses next year or that's probably too many to do.
[00:44:41] But if you do 50 or more, you'll you'll we'll find clients that way. So ask the ask your managing broker or top agents in your office what you could do to earn an opportunity to do an open house.
[00:44:53] And I know a lot of top agents will say when people ask them the first time they'll say no, they'll go, I don't know you well enough yet. Thank you and I'll keep you in mind.
[00:45:02] And they want to see if they come back or they want to see how hungry they really are. And then, you know, that that can also happen to so even if you get a no, you know, I would my next question would be could I ever earn a place to do this is or something I could do to really prove you that I would be a great fit for this particular listing because I want to help your your seller sell this property.
[00:45:21] And you know, so there's all of those things. So yes, make that a big play for 2025 anyone out there who is struggling with listings and right now it's tough to have to get less things.
[00:45:30] Let's talk about the current current climate right now we have interest rates, which are better than they were recently, but they're still a little higher than probably anyone would want.
[00:45:39] I don't think we're getting back down to the 3% days anytime soon, if ever, but we still have a lot of people locked into that 3% who purchased years ago. So it's a tricky situation for for sellers right now because they might not want to sell strictly because of that interest rate.
[00:45:55] So curious if that's coming up for you a lot when you meet with sellers. Does that seem to be to impact. I just don't know because I'm not out there doing it.
[00:46:04] Yeah, you know, I mean, I just think it kind of like varies. I do I mean, I am starting to see people wanting to just sell their homes and they do have that 2 1 1 2% for 3% and they're like, yeah, we just have to move.
[00:46:19] Yeah, you have to move too small like I mean we're coming up to what it's been since 2021 and 2020 it's almost been four years right so like people are they have so many different situations.
[00:46:32] Their families are going really get a job or whatever may be a lot happens even in two years so you know we're just seeing a lot of different things happen. I'm really excited to see what's going to happen in the beginning of next year.
[00:46:45] I mean we keep hearing all these different things right I'm hearing I don't know about you DJ like I'm hearing like 5 1 1 1 2% sometime next quarter.
[00:46:52] Let's hope. That'd be nice. And I think even I even think six and a half is reasonable. I mean it's it's not a fun number compared to.
[00:47:00] But anyway, I also wanted to just ask about you know working with buyers these days because as we know with the NAR settlement things have changed we now set up our own commission structure directly with our with our client as opposed to you know a coupling the commission as was done before.
[00:47:16] Or has that changed anything for you is it basically still business is usual or are you finding that those conversations are more challenging are they about the same just curious on on how that's affected your business.
[00:47:30] You know it's funny is that like I have never done a FSBO before my whole life and literally I think it was like August 4th to the 15 maybe whatever's like a week or something after the summer was August 17th was the NAR I think when it got it when it took effect.
[00:47:49] And I had a buyer and he liked this condo and it happened to be a vis-vo and like basically I he wasn't going to pay out a commission but I call that seller it was the easiest conversation I'm like hey this is going to be the commission I'll you what do you want a net and that was kind of our conversation that's how he's really started it and he was like this X amount of dollars I go great so if we do X can we can I have X and he was like that sounds like a great deal to me and I'm like
[00:48:19] okay cool so I mean I don't know that's a that's a fizz bow that's a fizz bow and that's a fizz bow so like that was a really great way for me to like just start off right off the bat like with I gave him the broker compensation agreement I had the talk with the buyer I mean everybody was fine and happy and it worked out great so that was I think just like after that I had I don't know I just had like confidence going into it and also I don't know I don't I didn't really find this as a big of a deal.
[00:48:49] As maybe some people did like in my head I just think it's just what the seller is going to net so right as long as we could come up with that that number and if you're an agent that's able to have that conversation with your seller or your buyer it's it really shouldn't be that much of an issue it's really we're just being more transparent now we are being transparent now that's all it is yeah I think it's it's buyers were always paying commissions they just didn't know it yeah right it was invisible
[00:49:19] it was it wasn't a check they physically wrote out so yeah yeah so that's that's good to know and then I wanted to also ask you know you have your building this team are you looking for more team members are you looking to grow your team you know sort of or you like this is what I because I have people on the show who are like I do not want any more people this is all I can handle and then of course people are are looking to grow but what do you see for yourself for for your team.
[00:49:44] mm hmm well I don't have a crystal ball but I I would love I would love to be able to grow my team to maybe one other agent I don't want to have a very big team at all.
[00:50:00] excuse me I but I am looking for a really solid agent that has had some years of experience so if you're out there and you're watching this feel free to reach out but I am looking for one for one more team so I would love to have maybe the max of between four and five people on my team and I would not go any further than that.
[00:50:24] that's awesome so for anyone out there who is in the Chicago and area and once to partner with the top producer and thinks they could be a value to Gia you know reach out to her also if you are in a market where people from Chicago move to maybe they retire or have a second home or vacation home that is also a person to connect with Gia she would love to chat with you and also people move into Chicago from other markets as well so.
[00:50:47] if you're one of our listeners from anywhere in the country and you think oh I sometimes have people to refer to in Chicago or I'd like to develop a relationship with Gia because she probably has clients that move out near me that would be an awesome reason to reach out and see if you guys have some synergies together and also once you do when everybody to follow Gia on her.
[00:51:07] it how an Instagram which is Gia Chicago I will have a link to that in the show notes all one last question for you and I think this is always a fun one for for our listeners is what was a miss what was a mistake that you made early on in your real estate career that if you could go back and change it I obviously can't but if you could you like I really didn't do that thing correctly so is there anything that comes to mind that was like a big a big sort of that one didn't work or maybe you lost a big client or or.
[00:51:37] something you know something like that.
[00:51:42] there's so many different things right I feel like that's how you become successful you fail so many times but so many different things I think I think honestly my biggest thing was just not following up with clients when I was when I was when I was an agent in the earlier years I really feel like that was something that I think about a lot.
[00:52:04] where I just thought gosh if I only had a CRM like I really do like if I had that I feel like things would be even different and then I guess honestly just to piggyback on that really quick I wish I moved to the city a little bit sooner I wish I wish I wish I wish I wish I
[00:52:23] came a city agent when I was like 26 or 27 because I just feel like that this is where this was I don't know it's just like a better fit and I don't know it was just more real or something for me.
[00:52:38] So I'm hearing listen to your intuition and intuition is almost never steered me wrong if I can identify what's true intuition and what's like fear or other things so if I can kind of separate those out and go oh that's intuition.
[00:52:53] I'm telling me to move to the city or whatever it usually turns out in the right way and then you know the other thing of following up following up by the way you know you sort of like well I guess it's following up that's everybody's biggest biggest challenge in this business so so let's all remember follow up follow up once the home is sold or the person moves into an apartment let's not lose lose touch with them because of course those people will need you in the future especially renters I mean anyone renting even if you didn't do the rental you should have in your calendar when that
[00:53:23] Lisa's gonna come do and maybe three months ahead of time or four months be like hey I know your lease is coming do let's talk about maybe what you want what what some options for for going for you.
[00:53:34] Yeah and you've gotten a lot of business doing that you know you've done you've worked with renters who can transition into buyers well anyone out there who is interested in working directly with Gia maybe your local Chicago agent reach out to her we will have all of her contact information in our show notes and again if you're somebody who's in a different market but have people coming and going
[00:53:53] from the Chicago area and Gia does city and suburbs she is she is everywhere so just reach out to her and also maybe you can develop a nice relationship there.
[00:54:03] Gia I am so grateful for your time today you were fantastic really enjoy having you on on the day and also just your positivity and sort of joy sort of seems to come through and maybe that isn't the perfect word for me but I've this what's coming to my mind is joy you have a lot of joy and I think that that really goes along
[00:54:23] with the way when things get hard is like still having this like I can make this work I can I can figure this out and failing failing constantly I'm the same way I do have a different type of position here in the industry but I fail way more than I succeed way more and and that's that's kind of the the secret to my success as well as just fail as much as you can and learn like you were saying at the beginning and make different choices of course in the future.

Thank you so much for having me DJ. I really appreciate the invite and excited to be here. Well, I learned about you at an event, which was like a month or a month or two ago at an A&N mortgage and they had you speak on a panel and you were so outstanding. I was like, I got to get I have to get you on our podcast. So welcome. We're excited to have you and I'm just excited to have another local Chicago person on who I have. I don't have a lot of Chicago people on these days. So this is really fun for me and our listeners are going to really appreciate what you have to talk about. But let's let's start with your story. So how and why did you get into real estate? Sure. Well, it was a long, long time ago DJ. Okay, so basically it really was a long time ago on I was 20. I was honestly around like 2021 years old. And my father was getting into flipping properties. So essentially he was an investor and he kept nudging me to get my real estate license and honestly it really did not sound that desirable to me at the time I was a little bit young, possibly a bit immature. What a 21 year old who's immature. That's impossible. I know right. So it's crazy. So like so I'm I didn't go to I didn't go to college and I was aspiring to be a tennis player right. Yeah. But I knew that you know I had to have some other options out there and my dad did keep kind of dangling the carrot and saying, hey, look, I'm starting to purchase a lot of properties. It'd be so cool as my daughter to be the listing agent. And like I could really get you into this and we really started off on the investor side of things. So before I actually got licensed, I actually used to be a almost like a photographer for my dad, but a different kind of photographer, not the one that goes and takes beautiful pictures of homes. It was a little bit different because these were for share of sales and my dad used to take me to the options and we used to bid on properties and this is right back in 2006. So I'm sure you know where this might be going. Yeah. The good old recession. So I agreed to get my license in 2006. Finally, I did. And as it happened, the market crashed and I was about 22 years old and it was, it was unexplainable to me, meaning as I just didn't understand how to navigate it. I was so young. What do I do now? Yeah. Totally. It was like, what do I do now? And it was interesting to say the least. So I started off in the industry like that. I was actually a suburb agent in Naperville. I did a lot of the western suburbs. I did a lot of the southern suburbs as well. And you know, it was just a whole different market than where I am right now. But I will say this. I did learn a lot. My parents always said to me, if you can stick this out, Jeeha, how many years it will be. I never predicted how many years that recession was going to be. A lot of tears were shed. But it was definitely one of those things that I'm really grateful that I listened to my parents and I stuck through it. And they're like, if you do this, you will come out on top. But you know, I do believe that because of the recession and the age I was at getting into it. It kind of, I don't want to say it like set me back a little bit, but I feel like my career didn't really get started until I came to the city, which was like in 2000 and almost 13. So you basically did like almost a reverse move, right? A lot of people here in Chicago, they, they're here in the city and in their early 20s. They have city life. They love it. And then like, I want to go have more space and be out in the burbs. And I think that's the most certainly the flight out there. And I like that you did the reverse flight because I'm a city person as well. So I very much appreciate that. And do you do enjoy selling more? And again, I know you sell not just in the city. Of course you go where your clients need you. Do you prefer to sell not not that ones better than the other, but is it more fun to sell in the suburbs in the city? What do you like to do? Yeah, I mean, like I'll be honest, like it's so fast paced out here in the city. This was always my, my vibe. When I was, I had a wonderful managing broker who was like, who was my, my mentor at Ryan Hill Realty. It was called back in Napier Bell. And he always said to me, gee, what are you doing? You need to be in the city or city girl. And I'm like, Jack, I'm old. Like I'm at the time of be like 27. You know, like everyone's so I know I know I look back and I'm like, what am I thinking? But it's just like, you know, I you see all these people that are starting to move back to like 29 3031 32 have kids. And I just really didn't think that I don't know I doubted myself honestly. And yeah, I got to the city super fast pace. I loved it. These past 10, 11, 12 years, whatever it's been, have been amazing. And but I will say this. I do not mind going to the suburbs and pulling into a driveway. Sure. Some kind of nice love it. Yeah. Yeah. And like, you know, like the, the rides are kind of meditative. And so I don't, I don't mind doing that at all. But I think if I was to pick one market over the other. Yeah. So I would I'm going to be a city agent all the way as long as I can tell, but I'm as long as it's a future. Yeah, I feel the same way I'm a city I've been living here for almost 20, I think 24, 25 years in the city. And I'm certainly open to moving wherever if I ever have to. But, but, but I prefer the city. But there's funny thing that people who don't live in the city of Chicago wouldn't know is that people who live in the city, especially women have this even I think more so than men obviously is this like there's always a little bit of like a little bit of fear and a little bit of danger. We live in Chicago. We always have that. And I live in wicker park. You're in Avondale, both nice areas. And there's always still a little bit of like looking over my shoulder at night. But it is a lot of fun. And there's a lot to do. And you know, I just walked outside on the Milwaukee this weekend and went to a comedy show like 10 steps more I live. You know, so you can't really beat that. But I do love pulling into a driveway when I visit my friends as well and say, oh, this is what a home looks like. I keep forgetting what what real homes look like. Yeah. But let's let's talk about making that transition from the suburbs to the city because it doesn't necessarily mean that your clients are also moving into the city or you know those are kind of could be two sort of separate worlds obviously people who live in the suburbs know people who live in the city. But was that a difficult transition just to find clientele when he moved in. I was honestly just like probably one of the hardest times in my life on I yeah, because I didn't have any clientele in the city. I really didn't and like I was I was honestly I was going through a breakup and it was like a really long term relationship and I kind of like just I like broke my lease early from I was living in Lyle and like broke up with my boyfriend then broke my lease and my main my manager broker was talking about this. I meant to encourage me like go now. So I did and I literally didn't have anything to bring with me and I'll be real with you. I did not have like a savvy CRM from in a lot of us. I think didn't either at that time really like things were just a lot different than they were. I don't was Instagram around. I think it was but it was like barely for being artsy, which you know I would post like cool pictures. Right. But right. So you know I think yes, sorry, I like to really talk a lot, but yes, you're so you're so nailed it on the high like it was difficult. It was so hard for me. I struggled. I was I was honestly I was really broke. I I had to learn the hard way and it really it really took a while for me to be able to get my feet on the ground with things. I had to make literally all new friends. I had some friends that were from my high school that still in the city, but you know I was going through that breakup and that breakup was actually a friend from my high school. Oh no. So I lost a lot of front. Yeah, you know that complicates things. Yeah. And it's just and again, like where I was doing the the opposite effect thing where I'm coming in and they're moving back. It's like it just it wasn't I don't know. I think I I couldn't have done it honestly at the worst time and that's okay because I feel like it really it you go through those obstacles and those are what really makes you stronger. I think as a person as an agent. I know what it's like to have it kind of rough. And I honestly think that the time I finally actually started really seeing some really great results was when I decided to I got asked to join a team with and this team that was leaving their their brokerage they were going to add properties and I actually knew one of the guys on the team I know them for many, many years back from neighbor bill actually was a friend. And they asked me to join the team. I ran with it and ever since that day I said I will never say no to anything I'm going to hustle I I will go to St Charles Illinois and do it ever after the I'll go back to the field I will do whatever I have to do to take leads like I And then I also said I will materialize them that was another thing because I had the experience I wasn't a new agent you know so That was really when when things started to really start working out for me was when I did that I had some camaraderie from the team and it really just it really felt good. What were some of the things that you did to help lead generation I know sometimes when you're a team sometimes your fed leads of course that's one of the nice benefits but also you know you're generating your own book of business too so how did you how did you do that with not a huge fear of influence you know you said pretty much people were like you know ships in the night you're people you knew we're moving the opposite way that you were it's not like you could you wouldn't go out and help them of course you would what you're not as present in their life at that point maybe in that you know they see it was a city person now maybe. So how did you but you were like i'm going to go everywhere and get is get all the leads I can because why not and you know how did you do that just out of curiosity. Yep so okay so yes not only did I just say yes to lead like when okay so for example there would be. At properties had their app that had just come out and I saw that people be like how do you want this lead you want this lead i'm not kidding I would be sitting here like this waiting until this like like I had I don't even know if you can have notifications i'm like high set but like I was just like. me me me and I would give this whole explanation how I have been an agent for this money I mean I took so much time into every explanation I would be all over the Facebook leads like I would see something come on. Hey i'm a buyer looking for first person i would reach out then I would DM them then I would. message them again like I was i was obsessed with it I literally wouldn't leave people alone I mean but I made sure I did it in a and then I sure was it's you know that wasn't too overbearing but I was very much responsive and on top of things and very consistent. And then once I started actually getting some business from that I always kept up with my clients from there I knew that these were probably going to be my bread and butter for the future I learned that the hard way from not taking anybody over from from neighbor bill I all these people I did close which I had closings when I was younger I didn't follow what that's that was a that's a problem by the way thank you for thank you for owning that. And and being vulnerable and admitting that because every single person on this call has is not perfect and we've all let clients fall by the wayside and it's something that it's very unfortunate and also very relatable and it happens. It it happens and you know what it's okay and as long as you learn from it eventually and then don't do that anymore because it's not helping your business and then don't bitch that you're not getting any referrals you know. But one thing I wanted to say was I really started doing a ton of open houses I set open houses for my team all the time like I mean sometimes I sat for open houses for the same property if my if my team we had a he had a lot of new development so I would I was like oh my gosh one and a half million dollar listing gas please I'm like i'll do it with just the studs in and I yeah yeah exactly right of course. You know and like all you need is that one person to come by and just maybe say hey look we happen to just be in the neighborhood and it's happened so that's that was a huge way for me to start getting business was doing open houses helping out with showings getting to know the buildings oh my gosh that was huge like that was a big thing because you didn't really have high rises and stuff like that. There was only single family homes in neighbor mostly you know. There are agents here in Chicago and in other metropolitan big metropolitan areas that literally make their good chunk of their career in one building or two buildings. Michael Rosenbloom's done that I've done an interview with him many many years ago he's king of that there's a number of agents that that have done that and so I want to talk about the one that you have done that with which is which is called the Metropolitan Place it's a high rise here in Chicago but tell us about how you got to do it. So I'm not into that building and how you started to develop relationships so that you became the agent of choice. 100% so I love that building so much by the way it's like it's just got a part of my heart and the reason why is because that's the home that I grew up in and I say that because when I was I was actually dating somebody and they really wanted to move that way and I really didn't want to and I pushed back on it and he was like no we got a move here fine so we end up moving in a metropolitan place and it was such a cool like city law it was like something that you just like kind of see out of the movie or you are something that you have like a vision of in your head when you're like younger like like when I was like in 1996 and I was like 12 or 13 and I'm like I just gave away my age great. Sorry shoot but in 1996 you know you're thinking like oh my god I want to live in the city in this loft and that was what it was basically so I ended up living there for about six and a half years and even though I was a renter in there I was a renter I was not I was not an owner nobody knew and so I know they invited me to okay so they invited me to all of their community events and they're like oh my gosh yeah you're so fun why don't you be part of the social committee and by and by the way we should mention to anyone listening that's not normally what they invite renters to do anything related to the building because of course that's for owners but they liked you and said come on by. Yeah they liked me and I was like honestly really into throwing parties so I was like hey let's we should do this we should bring my amp because I like I used to play play music and stuff and I had a bunch of different amps and like oh no we need like light as party up you know and so I would like suggest different types of catering and music and this and that and come up with all the ideas so they were super intrigued by it and it really was bringing the community together and that was really like the biggest step for me. And so after I stayed in there was there was just I was right there into that building was just becoming friends with a lot of the neighbors and then basically what happened was that boy forgot kicked out and and the new one moved in so and then that became my husband actually So my husband, I met him in metropolitan place. I know. His, that his somebody he worked with, they were my, they were my next door neighbor. And we basically just kind of like, I don't want to say you brand the building, but like we were just friends with everybody. And then I tried making an offer three different times with the owner on our place. I really wanted to buy it and live there. And they don't want to sell it yet. And they still haven't sold it. They're still renting it. But after that time, I was like, oh my gosh, I need to be in this building somehow, whether I'm going to live here later on or just sell the shit out of it. You know, so I kept in communication with everybody. And before you know it, I started getting one listing another listing another listing and rentals. I'll do anything rental listings by or whatever. And I have such a great core connection with them everybody that it actually helps within the network to like pitch that to other sellers. For, you know, in case I had like an in house buyer and house listing or whatever it might be right or pocket listing. So I think that I. I didn't really have to try that hard. It really was just about being part of like a lifestyle really. I kind of just made it my lifestyle. And that's really how it happened. It was super organic. But you know, like now I do send out marketing material, but I don't feel weird doing it. Where I'm like begging or asking for a business, I probably shouldn't say like that, but I don't feel that I'm asking for a business. They already know who I am. And every journey where they expect to get this booklet from me. And it basically states a whole market update of the whole year, everything that I've sold a little bit about my life. How I'm how I met my husband there. I have my dog was born there. You know, like it. Oh, so it's exclusive. It's exclusive to the building. Just to them only just to them early. And I do happy hours with them to like, I mean, just like literally I will shoot out little messages to the building. I mean, I know so many people there. So I just I have a personal email. I'll say, Hey, you want to go do a little happy hour over at the Mariano's in Los Aluf. You know, like, that's so funny because we're like, it's a grocery store, but that's actually where we used to go and hang out. It's what was like old times, you know, and just just really easy simple stuff. They still invite me to their community events and stuff. It's I'm really lucky. Yeah, it looks like it sounds like to me that you married kind of your passion to this opportunity. It was like, Oh, I like doing this. I like being of service. I like throwing, you know, social events and I like being helpful there. And so you just, you know, all of those buildings are always looking for people to help with those things because nobody wants to help. I know like the building I'm at. I will not be joining the board, but I also don't complain about anything. So I think that's a fair deal. I go, thank you for the board. Whatever, you know, whatever decisions you guys make. I won't complain. But I'm also not going to, I'm not going to do my time. I've done that before and learned my lesson. But, but if I was a practicing agent, I would totally be doing that because great opportunity to, and I'll give you just for anyone listening. You just reminded me of a really simple idea that I think a lot of agents forget. And I'll give you use myself as an example. So I live in a building called Alcove. It's in Wicker Park. Anyway, our audience won't know what that is. But anyway, it's a relatively new development like four years old maybe three three to four years old. I've lived there since the beginning. I can tell you the number of physical marketing materials that have shown up in my inbox from other agents. Literally, there's 46,000 REALTORS in the Chicago land area, including the suburbs. I have gotten zero, not one in four years. And I don't think it's because people know I'm in the business. They would be farming everyone in the in the building. So that is a crazy thing to say. Like I am shocked. Now I understand two people who move into new construction usually don't leave it with three years. But it would be a great time to start building a relationship with a, with a, with a, you know, a possible future seller. At some point, I'm probably going to move out of there and, you know, and, and cry because my interest rate is so low and I'm going to lose it. But the point is is, yeah, people have moved out of our building who were only there a year or two, you know, life got in the way for whatever they transfer jobs or some. But I am shocked. I am still today. I've been talking about this for years on my podcast. Not one person has ever sent me a piece of mail. Is that that is so there. What we're talking about is really what you were doing is you were, obviously, and you still do it. You're still putting material together for a building or for people listening could be a neighborhood. It could be a community. It could be, it could be really anything that you're interested in. But just to give people an idea that if you think all of all of these places are being farmed, my building has not been far once and we are, we are a building that should be farmed because we have some good, good sellers in there that, you know, have some high priced. And it's just places. So it's it's shocking to me, but that's how much opportunity there is. Yeah, it is crazy. Right. So you could become the alkova person if you want to. I know I'm like, just wait till you see next month in your mail. It'll be. Yeah, but I love that. So this idea of just staying top of mind with this that with that building that you're with and being still being a part of it. And also, you know, continuing to add value by sending out by putting those booklets together for that. I mean, that's that's a wonderful thing. Yeah, for four years, too, it's been consistent. Like just something to the viewers really quick that are maybe even like newer agents and stuff. I know some people like feel like, I did mailers for like six months or years. Whatever, that's not going to work. You might get lucky. I don't know. I never did, but I can tell you what, I after four years in a row, I've been gone from that building. This I've been in an annual four years. I haven't stopped once like every single month they do get a mailer and at every single January of the last four years or five, maybe even they get the booklet. So it's consistency. And what I love about that is it's every every 30 days and whether they just look at the, you know, the postcard or thing. Of course, yeah, and that's that's okay. We don't even care if they, of course, they're going to throw it out. But at least they're going to see your picture and your name before they throw it out, right? It's like, there's the thing of GSM. Okay, cool. And they toss it, but they see you and they remember they reminded they're reminded of what you are or what you do and who you are. So I think it is a great, great idea. And I'm shocked that more agents aren't doing that. I know doing mailers is expensive and it also maybe seems a bit antiquated. But I'm telling you, people aren't reading their emails. That's the other thing I would love to do a podcast called nobody reads your emails because nobody reads their emails because I know nobody does. It's either text message or physical mail, those are the only things that are actually consistently getting looked at. And even text messages goofy now because, you know, people, there's all such a spam on text message is a little harder to do. But, but yeah, so I love that. And it works, but you're right. You have to do it for, for at least a couple of years. Yeah. And you have to be willing just to eat the cost for a bit and realize maybe one transaction is going to pay for the year anyway. Exactly. Exactly. That's the kind of mindset you have to have. You just have to kind of go with it. You know, and if, if you don't want to pay for that all by yourself on a monthly or whatever, maybe there are options out there that you can work out with, maybe partnering with one of your lenders and seeing if they'd be willing to put the cost to. Yeah, let I would, I want to talk about just sort of your sense, this is something I don't ever talk about. And I think I think it's a fun thing to talk about is you are somebody who I suspect is often told how great your fashion sense is. You have your very intentional about your dress. You have a really unique style that that is is very cool, at least, you know, to me and not a lot of other people say the same thing about you. How, how much fun is it to sort of marry your style of, of, you know, sort of dress with work like it seems like that's something that you really truly enjoy. Oh my gosh, it's like the best question ever. So I love fashion so much on. Yes, I used to watch the 19 like in 1990, 1991, I used to watch all of the Donna Karen and D. Canway runway models, like I was like obsessed my, I mean, I would be like sitting in even Marcus just like waiting for my mom in the dressing room while she was trying on clothes forever. And I did not mind I would just like look at everything. I just I am obsessed with fashion. My favorite color is leopard, by the way, I know, right. Yeah, but no, I got to say this like I feel like that's one thing that might maybe like actually be something unique that might stop me aside from 100% some other agents. I'm not really the most typical dressing looking agent. And I am, I am very professional and I'm, but I'm, I believe in being just yourself and I love colors. I love colors. I like black. I love jewelry. I love hair. I'm big into lipstick. I just love having a very eclectic look. And I think that you can have an edgy eclectic look, being in a professional setting still. And you don't have to just wear, you know, just to suit all the time or just to dress all the time. I think there is a way to still have your fashion sense and your style and incorporate that into your showings or whatever it may be. Yeah, I think it really works for you too because it definitely feels authentic to you. Right. So when I, when I've seen you in person, I'm like, oh, yeah, that she's very intentional about her dress. It's very cool. It's unique. And probably it's part of your brand. And I think there's, there's nothing inherently negative about that. I know sometimes people want to, you know, obviously your professionalism, your skill level, all of the things you do are really the most important part. But it's nice to have a really intentional aesthetic and you do. And I think that that's something that a lot of agents could really think about what is my aesthetic, even if it's maybe if it's more conservative, more, more, you know, more edgy, whatever it might be, you know, really be intentional about that. People remember how people are dressed. I mean, they really do. I want to go back all the way back to you at the beginning, you talked about really wanting to become a tennis pro. And I just got back from, well, not just about a few months ago, I went to the US Open out in out in flushing. Yeah. So it was my second year in a row going. Yeah, so much fun. So, and that was, yeah, it's, by the way, if anyone ever has an opportunity to go out to the US Open, if you're in New York, you've probably already done that if you live there. But if you haven't, it's a great opportunity to really see some, some wonderful tennis and just got to get a sense of, of what that the US Open really is, which is really a lot of fun. But I'm curious about when you were playing, I'm a tennis player as well. But when you were, when you started in tennis and you really were going to make this your career, it's a tremendous amount of discipline like any other sport. So can you talk a little bit about the amount of work that you were putting into it and did that translate over into once you were, you know, a real estate agent did those skills kind of kind of transfer over. Yeah, so that is a whole other part of my life. It basically was my life, the whole first probably at least the first 15 to 17 years of my life. Yeah, so basically I was a US T A tennis player, a US T junior national tennis player. I, from the time I remember since I was about maybe like six years old, I started when I was about four, but when I was probably about six or seven is when things had to really get serious, like I literally was sat down by my parents. I have, I have the European tennis parents, my dad's from Hungary, my mom's from Italy. So, you know, they have the dreams, right, they come to America, it's like, okay, we have our tonner and maybe she'll be a tennis pro. I don't know, but basically I had to have a very serious talk with them and I was about six and a half. I remember I was in a car with them and they're like, you have to choose, you want tennis or you want to be a figure skater because I was doing both and I chose tennis. So, I've ever since six and a half, I basically just trained every single day and I was always going after school, I was picked up straight to tennis. I get a 10 private tennis lesson and then I would have a group tennis training, which would usually be around anywhere from like an hour private to like three hours of training afterwards. It was pretty consistent like that all the way up until high school when you become like 12 or 13 is really when it's like serious and my parents wanted to send me to the to the Voltaire. Sure down in Florida. Yeah, and it was a little scary because I was 12 when I had another serious talk with them and they really wanted to take, they really wanted to take it to another level. I was, you know, nationally ranked, it was one of those things where you either just do it full time at that point, you know, you shut off everything else in your life and you just go for it. I wasn't ready to do it. I was really, I cried a lot about it and I want to do it. I didn't want to leave my parents. Like I was, I don't even know, but it was friends as much. I just like didn't want to leave my parents. Well, what 12 year old does, I mean, I know, it's a big ask, it's a big ask for someone. It's just a big ask and like, you know, but I, but here's the thing. It really brought so much routine and discipline to my life now and you ask like, how do I apply it to or how have I applied it to my real state life and. You know, my biggest, my biggest thing that I think that I am, that I have a strength in is my, my wellness routine. I've always been into working out. I mean, I used to have a personal trainer at the age of eight. I don't know if people would frown upon that now, but back then, if people really did it, whatever. So I, I had a personal trainer. I was consistently always working out, always eating healthy. I mean, I was always thinking about what I have to eat and it was, it's, it hasn't changed, honestly. And now I think the fact that I'm able to wake up early in the morning and I can get things done. I have a schedule. I, I still love to work out. It helps to stress me. I love being a coach for my team. I've been coached my whole life. And I, I don't know, I think that it just really helps, but also with, with when I'm with my clients, I mean, I love being super competitive for them. If we're going into a multiple offer situation or maybe not even a multiple offer, just knowing that there's a hot property and they want it, like I want to get it for them. So it's, it's almost like to me, I look at it as, it's like a match every time I'm, I'm going out into the field with them. I want to do the best I can for them. I'm, I'm sure that's got to do with something with how I play tennis. Well, yeah, you just had, you had to do a lot of activity. You had to be intentional about your food and your, and your schedule and, you know, your exercise and all of that is, is just being really in setting up an intentional kind of life where you're like, this is what I do. And maybe it was done for you when you were little because that's, you know, that's how it works. But as an adult, you know, it's, I think a lot of us could benefit from really thinking about building. It's sort of like letting things happen and, and just kind of going, well, I should do this. I should do that is like literally sitting down and saying, let's design my, my diet or let's design my, my health regimen or let's design my marketing practice for finding new clients and not just kind of flying by the emails that come in and responding to text messages and all of the sort of what we need to deal with us right in front of us that can feel really productive and technically is productive for our existing clients. And whatever is urgent in the moment, but this idea of planning in advance, I mean, you talked about like nutrition, like for me, I figured this out many years ago that maybe it's just me and other people wouldn't struggle as much with this. But I realized if I didn't plan my lunch before I left for the day, if I didn't bring a lunch or plan my lunch, I was going to make a bad decision for lunch. So I was, I was literally going to make an unhealthy decision. And so I'm like, well, I can't trust myself to make a good health decision in the moment because I might be stressed out, I might be wanting to escape, I might be just feeling crummy, whatever. And you know fast food looks pretty good when you're stressed out. So I, and I, and you know, so what I do is I plan my meals out, I batch cook, I do those things, not because I'm like so brilliant. It's because I have such a weak, you know, self control. And so I think that's part of it too is is thinking about like what are you good at, what aren't you good at. And you know, because for you lifestyle is everything. So you are intentional about your stuff, but I'm sure there's parts of your business that you aren't good at or that you don't enjoy doing. And can you talk about sort of how you get through those tasks or do you delegate or do you, you know, team members help. So what are, what are the things that about because everyone has parts of their business if they're doing it all themselves, they're like, I'm not good at it. I don't like it. I mean, honestly, that's to me, like that's like one of the biggest things to realize in order to become a successful agent. You do need to realize what you don't love to do in your business and you do need to realize what your strengths are in your business, what you like to do. Because if you are doing those things that you don't love all the time, you're going to get burnt out. And some of those things for me were a lot of the paperwork. I really wasn't enjoying to do those anymore because as your business grows and you now have, you know, 8 to 10 to 12 to 14 to 15 listings and then buyers. Now you're like, OK, this is a lot of stuff to do and you're not able to give your clients as great of service because you're thinking about how you have to upload. Disclosure, you know, to your deal management system or whatever it is. So one of those things that I decided to do a few years ago was I decided to hire a transaction manager. And it's literally that's changed my life. So that has been a huge thing for me as far as getting things organized on that end. And then, I did you sorry. And then for my team, with them, they've been helping me a lot on my showing. So for a lot of my listings, I they do assist me on being at those showings. I try to have an agent at every single showing for my listings. Obviously things do come up, right? I mean, our settlers do get books sometimes, but I tried to have somebody always at the showings open houses. I'll be very real with you. I did not love doing open houses. I really don't. And I think that after putting in a little over 17 years, I think that I kind of get to say if I want to do an open house or not really or by feel like it. And just so you know, I always set my clients expectations with this. And if someone really wants me to be at an open house, of course, we'll do it for them. But my agents are amazing and they are very hungry to do open houses and they do them all the time. So I usually have them do my open houses for my listings. So I think those are two. Those are probably two I think of my biggest things right there are really the transaction management side and open houses. Yeah, transaction management is interesting because it you know, for a good transaction coordinator, just for even one transaction, you can hire people to do individual deals. It's pretty affordable. I found it's like usually on 500 bucks or less and you only pay for closes and yeah, you know, the quality can vary depending on who you get. But you can find some decent people eventually you have somebody you hire somebody and they're you know, they're your person and that's even better. And the other thing I wanted to also mention is these open houses. So you know, it's funny because you know, you talk about your top producer, you're busy and open houses take time. And there's just a lot to do with them and you've been doing them for 17 years. You're like, okay, you know, maybe it's maybe I can off offload or delegate those to some of my team members because they're the ones that probably need leads more than even I do for which is really what open houses, you know, quite frankly do more than anything is hopefully provide some buyer leads. Hopefully for that property, but probably for any property because they're people walking in. So this is something that if I were an agent and I were in your office and I didn't have any listings, I would be begging and pleading with you. Please, please, please let me do an open house and you know, I probably have to earn that the right for you to say, okay, you can do one. And it's something that I want all of our listeners to consider doing if there's anyone in your office with a listing, beg and plead with them to help, you know, help you, you know, set up an open house and you know see because it's going to help them to the owner. The owner is going to think they're doing something great for that property. It's going to help you as the agent because you're going to learn how to talk to people about real estate and about a particular property and and also it's. Yeah, it's just a great way to get leads. So I think that's awesome. I think that's fantastic and and you know begging and you were talking about this when you joined a team you were like, I was doing a lot of open houses because the team had. All the time, all the time, it was just and it was just such a good way to to be able to. To feel busy like, you know, especially as being a new agent, it's like, I don't know why I just feel like I loved filling up my weekends with having all of this to do. And then I at the same time, I remember thinking, wait, I'm also learning how to do this even better and learning these buildings like going up and down some of these high rise like I now know where the amenities are. I know where this is and you're and you're practicing saying your spiel. I mean, there's a lot to say when you're walking into a condor, people are asking questions about reserves and this and that, you know, it's like you it's it's all practice. So I think it's a great way for you to be able to practice because they don't teach you this stuff in real estate school. Yeah, yeah, so everyone listening open houses still work. They are super effective and they, you know, you do you have to do a lot of them though you don't do one and expect, you know, five buyers to walk in. They may or may not, but you do 100 open houses next year or that's probably too many to do. But if you do 50 or more, you'll you'll we'll find clients that way. So ask the ask your managing broker or top agents in your office what you could do to earn an opportunity to do an open house. And I know a lot of top agents will say when people ask them the first time they'll say no, they'll go, I don't know you well enough yet. Thank you and I'll keep you in mind. And they want to see if they come back or they want to see how hungry they really are. And then, you know, that that can also happen to so even if you get a no, you know, I would my next question would be could I ever earn a place to do this is or something I could do to really prove you that I would be a great fit for this particular listing because I want to help your your seller sell this property. And you know, so there's all of those things. So yes, make that a big play for 2025 anyone out there who is struggling with listings and right now it's tough to have to get less things. Let's talk about the current current climate right now we have interest rates, which are better than they were recently, but they're still a little higher than probably anyone would want. I don't think we're getting back down to the 3% days anytime soon, if ever, but we still have a lot of people locked into that 3% who purchased years ago. So it's a tricky situation for for sellers right now because they might not want to sell strictly because of that interest rate. So curious if that's coming up for you a lot when you meet with sellers. Does that seem to be to impact. I just don't know because I'm not out there doing it. Yeah, you know, I mean, I just think it kind of like varies. I do I mean, I am starting to see people wanting to just sell their homes and they do have that 2 1 1 2% for 3% and they're like, yeah, we just have to move. Yeah, you have to move too small like I mean we're coming up to what it's been since 2021 and 2020 it's almost been four years right so like people are they have so many different situations. Their families are going really get a job or whatever may be a lot happens even in two years so you know we're just seeing a lot of different things happen. I'm really excited to see what's going to happen in the beginning of next year. I mean we keep hearing all these different things right I'm hearing I don't know about you DJ like I'm hearing like 5 1 1 1 2% sometime next quarter. Let's hope. That'd be nice. And I think even I even think six and a half is reasonable. I mean it's it's not a fun number compared to. But anyway, I also wanted to just ask about you know working with buyers these days because as we know with the NAR settlement things have changed we now set up our own commission structure directly with our with our client as opposed to you know a coupling the commission as was done before. Or has that changed anything for you is it basically still business is usual or are you finding that those conversations are more challenging are they about the same just curious on on how that's affected your business. You know it's funny is that like I have never done a FSBO before my whole life and literally I think it was like August 4th to the 15 maybe whatever's like a week or something after the summer was August 17th was the NAR I think when it got it when it took effect. And I had a buyer and he liked this condo and it happened to be a vis-vo and like basically I he wasn't going to pay out a commission but I call that seller it was the easiest conversation I'm like hey this is going to be the commission I'll you what do you want a net and that was kind of our conversation that's how he's really started it and he was like this X amount of dollars I go great so if we do X can we can I have X and he was like that sounds like a great deal to me and I'm like okay cool so I mean I don't know that's a that's a fizz bow that's a fizz bow and that's a fizz bow so like that was a really great way for me to like just start off right off the bat like with I gave him the broker compensation agreement I had the talk with the buyer I mean everybody was fine and happy and it worked out great so that was I think just like after that I had I don't know I just had like confidence going into it and also I don't know I don't I didn't really find this as a big of a deal. As maybe some people did like in my head I just think it's just what the seller is going to net so right as long as we could come up with that that number and if you're an agent that's able to have that conversation with your seller or your buyer it's it really shouldn't be that much of an issue it's really we're just being more transparent now we are being transparent now that's all it is yeah I think it's it's buyers were always paying commissions they just didn't know it yeah right it was invisible it was it wasn't a check they physically wrote out so yeah yeah so that's that's good to know and then I wanted to also ask you know you have your building this team are you looking for more team members are you looking to grow your team you know sort of or you like this is what I because I have people on the show who are like I do not want any more people this is all I can handle and then of course people are are looking to grow but what do you see for yourself for for your team. mm hmm well I don't have a crystal ball but I I would love I would love to be able to grow my team to maybe one other agent I don't want to have a very big team at all. excuse me I but I am looking for a really solid agent that has had some years of experience so if you're out there and you're watching this feel free to reach out but I am looking for one for one more team so I would love to have maybe the max of between four and five people on my team and I would not go any further than that. that's awesome so for anyone out there who is in the Chicago and area and once to partner with the top producer and thinks they could be a value to Gia you know reach out to her also if you are in a market where people from Chicago move to maybe they retire or have a second home or vacation home that is also a person to connect with Gia she would love to chat with you and also people move into Chicago from other markets as well so. if you're one of our listeners from anywhere in the country and you think oh I sometimes have people to refer to in Chicago or I'd like to develop a relationship with Gia because she probably has clients that move out near me that would be an awesome reason to reach out and see if you guys have some synergies together and also once you do when everybody to follow Gia on her. it how an Instagram which is Gia Chicago I will have a link to that in the show notes all one last question for you and I think this is always a fun one for for our listeners is what was a miss what was a mistake that you made early on in your real estate career that if you could go back and change it I obviously can't but if you could you like I really didn't do that thing correctly so is there anything that comes to mind that was like a big a big sort of that one didn't work or maybe you lost a big client or or. something you know something like that. there's so many different things right I feel like that's how you become successful you fail so many times but so many different things I think I think honestly my biggest thing was just not following up with clients when I was when I was when I was an agent in the earlier years I really feel like that was something that I think about a lot. where I just thought gosh if I only had a CRM like I really do like if I had that I feel like things would be even different and then I guess honestly just to piggyback on that really quick I wish I moved to the city a little bit sooner I wish I wish I wish I wish I wish I came a city agent when I was like 26 or 27 because I just feel like that this is where this was I don't know it's just like a better fit and I don't know it was just more real or something for me. So I'm hearing listen to your intuition and intuition is almost never steered me wrong if I can identify what's true intuition and what's like fear or other things so if I can kind of separate those out and go oh that's intuition. I'm telling me to move to the city or whatever it usually turns out in the right way and then you know the other thing of following up following up by the way you know you sort of like well I guess it's following up that's everybody's biggest biggest challenge in this business so so let's all remember follow up follow up once the home is sold or the person moves into an apartment let's not lose lose touch with them because of course those people will need you in the future especially renters I mean anyone renting even if you didn't do the rental you should have in your calendar when that Lisa's gonna come do and maybe three months ahead of time or four months be like hey I know your lease is coming do let's talk about maybe what you want what what some options for for going for you. Yeah and you've gotten a lot of business doing that you know you've done you've worked with renters who can transition into buyers well anyone out there who is interested in working directly with Gia maybe your local Chicago agent reach out to her we will have all of her contact information in our show notes and again if you're somebody who's in a different market but have people coming and going from the Chicago area and Gia does city and suburbs she is she is everywhere so just reach out to her and also maybe you can develop a nice relationship there. Gia I am so grateful for your time today you were fantastic really enjoy having you on on the day and also just your positivity and sort of joy sort of seems to come through and maybe that isn't the perfect word for me but I've this what's coming to my mind is joy you have a lot of joy and I think that that really goes along with the way when things get hard is like still having this like I can make this work I can I can figure this out and failing failing constantly I'm the same way I do have a different type of position here in the industry but I fail way more than I succeed way more and and that's that's kind of the the secret to my success as well as just fail as much as you can and learn like you were saying at the beginning and make different choices of course in the future.
