[00:02:40] Hey, everyone it's Ali Gar set again or Ali the agent on all social media that spelled
[00:02:47] A.O.I. and I am back with my first segment of the buyer checklist
[00:02:54] I promise DJ that I would share
[00:02:58] Everything in my checklist so originally you know the checklist were the buyers checklist the seller checklist the investor checklist the onboarding checklist
[00:03:07] Originally everything was for my just for my downline, but I really want to I really hope that this helps just better the industry all together
[00:03:15] So I am giving away my buyer checklist my seller checklist my 200 step onboarding checklist for agents
[00:03:23] No matter what level or like level they're at is still just for my downline
[00:03:27] But I am giving away my home buyer checklist and my seller one so this is part one of maybe two or three for the buyer side
[00:03:37] we'll see how it goes and
[00:03:39] Then I'm also going to have a two part buy or two part for the seller checklist
[00:03:44] So I am on trello and I am going to be walking through
[00:03:49] How I have everything set up on trello if you want to follow along watch this on YouTube because I am sharing my screen and
[00:03:58] If you can't that's okay. I'm going to make it I'm going to vocalize as much as I can so in that way
[00:04:04] It's as if you are following along so I'll start with what is even trello right trello is a free project management
[00:04:12] System you could use your CRM, but I started using trello because it was free and I kind of just stuck with that
[00:04:19] So I'm going to show you and vocalize how I have this laid out
[00:04:24] Starting from the very left side I have a whole section for sellers and then a whole section for buyers and then a section for
[00:04:32] referrals as well and
[00:04:34] What I do for those in my downline is I give them access straight to this trello checklist they can copy and paste it but
[00:04:42] For those that are outside of my downline I will be sending you a link to it
[00:04:48] So that way you can have access to but not the full access that I've given that I've poured my heart and soul into for my downline specifically so
[00:04:57] On the left hand side here I have it I have sellers and buyers broken into three different columns
[00:05:03] So one is like far out sellers that I'm calling like sea sellers
[00:05:07] B sellers is you know three to six months out
[00:05:10] Again to make sure that you're hitting everyone on a on that specific tempo
[00:05:14] Then I have the third column is a seller is getting ready to list
[00:05:18] You know you need to go on an appointment today and meet with them then I have
[00:05:23] One week before going live the next column is once they are live on the market the next column is once they're under contract
[00:05:30] Because again as you start getting more and more you know properties under contract and working with more buyers and sellers to scale
[00:05:39] You're gonna get overwhelmed so you need to have this organization in the beginning
[00:05:43] So as if you've never used trello you can like drag and drop little cards so you can you know as soon as someone's under contract and then they're
[00:05:51] They're out a week out from closing just a drag and drop the card now
[00:05:55] You know the numbers change for how many are about a week out from closing?
[00:06:00] And the next column is the size of for sellers then on the buyer side which I will be focusing on today is
[00:06:07] How I work through my buyers so again C buyers about a year out
[00:06:11] But be buyers about six months out ish and then a buyers hot buyers or hot leads talks on today
[00:06:18] Then of course under contract has its own column one week out from closing
[00:06:23] Once they're closed for 2023 or whatever year we're in when you're listening to this then an archived one closed
[00:06:31] But in the past you know before or further out then a year ago if that makes sense and then I also have a dead lead pot
[00:06:38] column as well and then I go into the referrals
[00:06:42] I have everything consolidated onto this trello board again. This was for this was for the downline so they can just see how I
[00:06:49] Organize things I would show you mine. It is crazy
[00:06:53] It has the same exact thing but in order to make this as clear and
[00:06:59] Easy for you to follow along and for the agents to follow along in my crew
[00:07:05] I made it as simple as possible. So this is a template. So let's start
[00:07:10] Let's open up this trello checklist
[00:07:11] And in the beginning here is the source that's the first thing you need to be tracking is who is giving you business
[00:07:19] Where is your business coming from because that is what you want to replicate double down on you know if it's all coming from Zillow
[00:07:26] Then double down on Zillow if it's all coming from a couple people that you know that consistently give you business
[00:07:31] You show them some love give them some gifts and
[00:07:34] And say thank you. So you need to know you need to track
[00:07:38] Because I'm such a huge proponent of tracking everything a track where your leads are coming from
[00:07:44] So then of course I have like just the typical questions of
[00:07:47] What you're gonna be asking what you need to know once you're starting to work with the buyer?
[00:07:52] I have some attachments here. They might not apply to everyone because this is a buyer broker specifically for our area
[00:07:59] Critical dates list of course. This might not apply to you, but that's okay
[00:08:03] You can include your own attachments
[00:08:06] And then buyer
[00:08:08] Initiation this is the first portion of the checklist. So I have my checklist
[00:08:14] Sorted into different segment segments. So when we first start talking to a buyer
[00:08:20] First thing is add them to your calendar add them to your CRM. So that way you know to follow up at what tempo
[00:08:27] What are the notes of what you previously previously said?
[00:08:30] The second for the second portion here is
[00:08:35] Take the intake from the calendar and this is what I used to have as buyer email number one
[00:08:42] For my buyers. I have buyer emails one through six. It's canned. It's template. It's evergreen
[00:08:48] So I just copy and paste all I do is just change this who the recipient is for
[00:08:54] But I used to have this as buyer email number one now what I do is I send all buyers to my calendar
[00:09:00] Calendly is a paid service. It's about a hundred and sixty dollars a year
[00:09:04] I highly recommend you sign up for it in case you haven't already but and if you want to follow along there too
[00:09:12] with
[00:09:14] Whether you're looking at the screen or not
[00:09:16] You can go on mine and copy the exact questions that I have it's open to the public
[00:09:21] So if you go on calendly.com slash gar said realty that's spelled g-a-r-c-e-d realty slash buyer
[00:09:31] We'll see exactly what my buyers are filling out before they meet with me. So I'll show you here
[00:09:37] Go as if you're going to be booking an appointment. I'm getting their name email number. I have a
[00:09:43] Next up is the box that says, you know, will you be selling another home before during this this next purchase?
[00:09:50] Yes or no if yes
[00:09:51] What's that address with the zip code of the home you'll be selling because when we meet at the time that they scheduled for
[00:09:58] I'll be asking if they want a
[00:10:00] REALTOR in that area to help them sell their home before they purchase with us
[00:10:05] What's the reason that you're buying and selling?
[00:10:08] Then I also have I also ask what are the top three must-haves very important as you all know
[00:10:15] What are the top three wants?
[00:10:17] What are the top three deal breakers and
[00:10:20] The catch all is there anything else that you'd like me to know to be better prepared for our meeting?
[00:10:25] so
[00:10:26] This they might come out with something out of life field better that they put it in this calendly now before your appointment with them instead of
[00:10:35] You know on the fly where you might not know the answer and you could have research it beforehand
[00:10:39] And this last section is for them to send text messages for Calendly to send text to the whoever's booking the call
[00:10:46] What this is only portion one right? I'm not I'm not going to go into Calendly today
[00:10:50] Although I can on a on a next beating
[00:10:54] If you guys wish but in the back end of Calendly I also
[00:10:58] Go into the work flows tab
[00:11:01] Because I want to make sure that I'm not going to be stood up
[00:11:06] So I have the automatic email and text send out to the buyers or send out to anyone who books with me
[00:11:13] Saying thanks for you know confirming you know we're on for xyz you scheduled this this specific type of meeting
[00:11:20] And then I also have a 24 hour out meeting in case they book out more than a day out and then I also have the hour before
[00:11:28] It sends them a text it sends them an email saying hey, we look forward to seeing you in one hour for the home buying consultation
[00:11:34] So let's go back to my trello checklist
[00:11:36] That is what I have all the buyers fill out. This is what used to be in my buyer email number one
[00:11:41] So I will not be covering by email number one because instead now I have calendly saved so much time
[00:11:49] So you take the information of what they put in the buyer
[00:11:53] appointment
[00:11:54] And you start looking you know you already start thinking about what kind of homes are looking at who's going to be in the meeting
[00:12:00] Etc
[00:12:01] So then going down this checklist here
[00:12:04] Ask the the buyers before going under contract with them
[00:12:08] This is while you are meeting with them over zoom and I meet with everyone over zoom because a lot of my
[00:12:15] A lot of my meet and potatoes clients are actually out of state
[00:12:18] So because I do have a military background so a lot of them are PCSing is what they call moving in the military
[00:12:25] So but then I got used to that and I figured that that was such a
[00:12:28] Better time spent even if they are local in the area nobody wants a drive to an office nobody want
[00:12:35] That's just a power move, I think
[00:12:37] so
[00:12:39] save the time for them and for you meet over zoom and
[00:12:43] That is where you go over a couple of questions even more questions
[00:12:47] Because count only only allows 10 questions
[00:12:50] So that's where you ask them how often do you expect to hear from me?
[00:12:54] What how can I be the best agent for you and a lot of agents have issues with that question because it kind of like
[00:13:00] Shifts the power dynamics if they if you want to call it that but don't forget that not only are they interviewing you as an agent
[00:13:08] You are interviewing them as clients do not work with someone that doesn't make you feel good, you know
[00:13:13] There there is so much business to be had especially now that so many REALTORS are leaving the business
[00:13:20] Scoop up the rest of the business
[00:13:22] Don't don't be afraid to say no because they're every single client that you take on
[00:13:27] I'm probably preaching to the choir here, but every single client that you take on that
[00:13:32] You don't feel good about you know you have like that
[00:13:37] Like those bad butterflies in your stomach whenever they call you or text you that is a
[00:13:43] Sure sign that you are not meant to be working together and that is okay
[00:13:46] Let them go because all the time that you're spending with them is time that you could be spending with other clients that make you feel good
[00:13:54] So anyway
[00:13:55] Then also ask them what's the best method of communication of course because some people only like phone calls of course as you guys know
[00:14:01] I don't like phone calls, but if they do I guess what I'm doing phone calls
[00:14:06] Text email whatever it is what I like about Trello is I can add these notes to the very very top
[00:14:12] So as your Trello board
[00:14:15] gets busier as you're adding other clients here you can easily
[00:14:19] You know see say Emma buyer in this city or this type of property text or call
[00:14:26] So that way you don't have to remember. Oh does Emma like tax?
[00:14:29] Let me look at that. Call and lean. Let me see that email that came in. No, it says right there Emma likes text messages
[00:14:36] Then add them to your CRM over here. I have kvCORE and I love kvCORE
[00:14:41] I didn't in the beginning, but wow like I really really like I I only know about 30% of what it
[00:14:47] Handles and I'm actually testing this out too
[00:14:50] So if if you want a copy of this checklist and you haven't already reached out to me on on social media
[00:14:56] text the word
[00:14:58] checklist to
[00:15:00] 520
[00:15:02] 341
[00:15:04] 2552 more than happy to send it to you
[00:15:08] Then of course you want to contact the lender or connect them to a lender. I usually do like a group chat with the lender
[00:15:14] Then of course suck them up on a search next on the Trello checklist is check in three days after setting them up on the search and
[00:15:23] this is I also have set up on my
[00:15:26] CRM so as I add each client into the CRM in kvCORE specifically and I'm sure others do the same thing
[00:15:33] I add task so in three days from when we met I'm going to add a task to notify me to reach out to the client saying hey
[00:15:42] Did you like everything on the on the search? Is there anything I could switch super easy for us to do so just let us know
[00:15:47] want to make sure we're not sending you trash so
[00:15:51] Then here as you can tell next step is I had to send by your emails 1 and 2 now of course by email number 1 no longer exists
[00:15:59] So let me know what let me change that right here send email number 2
[00:16:04] Let me show you email number 2 what does buyer email number 2 have
[00:16:09] Ali well, let me show you I
[00:16:12] Use superhuman. It's a way to do a lot of shortcuts, but you can do the same thing
[00:16:18] With just had saving this as a
[00:16:20] template on either Gmail or Outlook whatever you use but
[00:16:25] Templated emails do not be copying or do not be writing the same email over and over again
[00:16:30] That's not a way to scale and you want to be able to scale. I imagine if you're listening to this so
[00:16:36] right here in two seconds. I pulled up buyer email number 2 and
[00:16:40] It's the title is we're excited to work with you because what buyer email number 2 is is the confirmation
[00:16:46] That you and I are working together exclusively. You're not going to be using another REALTOR
[00:16:51] So therefore buyer email number 2 is very important for me because this is the mean potatoes
[00:16:57] Everything I poured my heart and soul into this email into everything really that I do checklist everything
[00:17:03] and
[00:17:04] This has this is the way ahead. I show them the eggs
[00:17:08] I show them everything of what buying a home is like in this market
[00:17:12] So I started off with a video this video is evergreen. It's not a specific to I don't say any names
[00:17:19] I don't say any specific information because I want this video to be evergreen and used for every single buyer email number 2
[00:17:25] In this in this video
[00:17:27] You'll see that I actually all I do is go over all of the words in the email because if buyers are to get
[00:17:35] An email like this nobody likes reading anymore
[00:17:38] So even if you make a video of you reading what you are sending them they will watch that
[00:17:45] Better, you know, they will watch that they will feel better instead of giving them homework
[00:17:50] Hey read this whole long email and
[00:17:52] You know, that's it. So
[00:17:55] I go over in this video what exactly I'm relaying to them in words of that email
[00:18:02] Starting with number one what to do right now. I give them homework, you know buyers want to be told what to do
[00:18:09] even even if they are
[00:18:12] Investors that have you know purchased multiple properties before they want to know think about it as a buyer
[00:18:17] What is the next step what do you want for me? What do I need to do and what's next?
[00:18:21] Always think about that like what do they need to be hearing from me a lot of agents are too scared to add their
[00:18:28] To assigning them homework and I tell them straight up buyers. This is your homework
[00:18:32] So what to do now is complete the buyer or open the complete buyer client PDF
[00:18:39] This contains the entire step-by-step on how to purchase a property and boy does it
[00:18:44] You'll see number two before I open and I'll open all the attachments at the end
[00:18:49] Number two is message me if you've already had other agents show you properties
[00:18:54] We do not overstep or steal clients because if they have that if for some reason they really don't like them then
[00:19:01] I want to reach out to that agent and make sure because that agent might not even know and a lot of agents are too scared to do this
[00:19:06] I don't care. I do not steal clients. I tell everyone in my crew like we do we do there's so much shadiness that happens in this industry
[00:19:13] Don't make it worse if you are working with another agent excellent then work with that agent
[00:19:19] We are going to focus our time on other clients that only want to work with us and I have no issue saying that
[00:19:25] And believe it or not. I've only ever lost two clients because of that and that's okay
[00:19:31] number three is
[00:19:32] Walk through the purchase contract was which is attached and with this video that I made for you
[00:19:37] This needs to be reviewed before we place offers number four is check your jump folder
[00:19:42] In case the listings that we send to you through that through our website through the MLS
[00:19:47] Is sent to your junk
[00:19:48] Number five is review the seven ways to make your offer standout video
[00:19:53] Number six review the buyer advisory on due diligence best practices
[00:19:59] Number seven send us your pre approval or proof of funds we cannot take the next steps without that and
[00:20:06] Then
[00:20:07] Following this email here. I have once again whenever you have a property that you like based off the emails that we send you
[00:20:12] Please do the following. This is what you do once you find a property that you like one
[00:20:17] Make sure it's in a location where you'd like it to be I cannot talk about you know as as you know
[00:20:21] Realters cannot talk about what area is safe
[00:20:23] So instead what we can do is give you the resources for you to figure that out on your own
[00:20:28] So this is a list of schools
[00:20:30] For you to do your research if schools are important
[00:20:32] This is spotcrime.com
[00:20:34] Maps.google.com drop the little yellow guy walk the neighborhood virtually in case you're not already there
[00:20:39] Make sure it's within your pre approval amount
[00:20:42] Ensure your spouse or all other buying parties uproot and
[00:20:46] Sure the numbers work for you. Let's connect it with your lender
[00:20:49] That's why I do a group text with the lender
[00:20:52] And if you're serious about it enough to make an offer and I tell this over the zoom call with my buyers
[00:20:57] If it's a level seven or above out of 10 like 10 as you really want that property if you want to make an offer on it
[00:21:04] That's when you send it to us. That's when you start taking a look
[00:21:07] So the wise there's no point of seeing a house that you only halfway are interested in anything under seven
[00:21:12] Don't send it then I tell them that
[00:21:16] Then number six. I'll look up all of the agent notes
[00:21:19] I'll send all the information to you any attachments that they have read it over
[00:21:23] That's number seven and number eight. Let's get you in their ASAP
[00:21:26] I try to kill the deal before it even starts if you can't tell because there's no point of seeing a house of
[00:21:32] Contact in the listing agent if the buyer is a VA loan and they're not even accepting VA loans
[00:21:36] Of course you're gonna ask hey was that was a fluke was this a typo?
[00:21:41] But I try to kill the deal before it starts save your time save your sanity
[00:21:46] Then as again, I reiterate it. There's no point of driving to view a property
[00:21:50] That's out of your budget in an area you don't like so make sure it is a hell
[00:21:54] yes
[00:21:56] and
[00:21:56] The purpose of this video is to make sure is because I wish I had more information when I was a buyer
[00:22:01] So I want to send you as much information as I can
[00:22:05] Hopefully not talking too fast
[00:22:07] Then of course an every single email that I have I have a way ahead
[00:22:11] This is what to expect next that's always what clients questions are
[00:22:16] What to expect next so next expect next by email number three, which will be sent as me a closer to drafting your offer
[00:22:24] I have one two three four five six six attachments in this buyer email number two
[00:22:30] That might sound like a lot, but again, I'd rather I'd rather send them only information now
[00:22:34] So that way they have it and they can review at their own leisure as opposed to later on when they're rushed
[00:22:40] Let's start with the beefiest one buyer client PDF now as you can tell if you're following along here this took a lot of work
[00:22:49] I did not make this PDF
[00:22:50] I hired somebody to do it because I am not
[00:22:53] digitally creative like this
[00:22:55] But it's in in pretty in pretty your
[00:22:58] format, you know, there's colors on here
[00:23:01] It's a little photo of me what I'm about that I used to be in the military
[00:23:05] I invest these are some podcasts that I've been on Casey wanted to learn a little bit more about me
[00:23:09] Then I have another video on page two page three of just a welcome introduction
[00:23:15] This is me. I'm excited to work with you page four is what you can expect what the buyer can expect from me
[00:23:21] Communication guidance local knowledge market expertise
[00:23:25] Number five page five is what I could expect from them submitted prequel
[00:23:29] You know before viewing properties. We cannot do that until I have your prequel and it's you know up to date
[00:23:35] That I also expect that they drive the neighborhood if there's a local area before we view that property that on the inside
[00:23:42] I expect that they see the property on the outside a lot of people might think oh, you know
[00:23:46] You're telling the buyer did you to do too much?
[00:23:49] Trust me. I've only ever gotten positive feedback about this like oh wow no one's ever told me to do that. That's a good idea
[00:23:55] It is it's a great idea Mike out there for my dad
[00:23:59] Some of the investors will so I want to know what's going on at 11 p.m. On a Friday
[00:24:03] And I tell them hey if you want to go extra credit if you go at
[00:24:06] At midnight on a Saturday night to see if you're actually comfortable in that area that you're interested in
[00:24:13] So of course you can follow you can went if you text me again the the keyword is going to be text training for a copy of everything here to
[00:24:22] 520 341 2552 so following along general information my work hours. This is how
[00:24:30] You know we're going to be communicating then the real
[00:24:35] Process starts where I have video after video three videos per page on talking them through the whole buying process
[00:24:42] buyer client expectations
[00:24:44] home buying process
[00:24:46] But what it's like to buy a mark to buy a house in this market
[00:24:50] shopping for a lender
[00:24:53] It's exactly what I do when I shop for a lender purchase contract overview and what is the specific market like right now
[00:25:01] Then four steps that buyers forget to make when placing offers and guess what guess where I thought of these four steps my own
[00:25:08] Personal mistakes. So don't make the mistakes I was making
[00:25:12] So make sure that their your buyers see this seven ways to make your offer stand out now
[00:25:17] I should probably update this one because this last one had the love letters, which I do not do anymore. I do not recommend
[00:25:25] And then under contract I'm under contract now what that's always a question, right and then at the bottom
[00:25:31] I you know follow me on my socials. I'm telling the buyer's ease. I'm not telling you this. You kind of you want to it's alley the agent so
[00:25:37] Um, that's the beefies attachment next is the word doc which I think my computer might freeze if I open
[00:25:44] So but what I have here is the what you can expect from me now
[00:25:48] What do I have here? It's a video that is already on the buyer client pdf
[00:25:54] That pdf has everything in a video series of what the buyer needs to make to make an offer and to work with me
[00:26:01] so the what you can expect from me attachment the second attachment is
[00:26:06] Exactly what I have already mentioned previously. It's just an award doc so they can follow along my work hours
[00:26:12] You know this is what I expect
[00:26:15] then
[00:26:16] The other two attachments are specific to this local area
[00:26:20] It's the purchase contract or in some states and I offered a purchase
[00:26:24] But whatever the purchase contract is in your area. I attached that I attached that buyer email number two
[00:26:30] But really it's their first email at their getting so that way right off the bat
[00:26:34] They see how formal it is
[00:26:37] Then I also attached the additional clause in case they need to
[00:26:42] Do anything outside of the original
[00:26:44] Contract so for example up wave the appraisal anything like that
[00:26:49] Then I also have the buyers road map
[00:26:51] Which is just a one-pager color, you know pretty looking thing. It's a wheel that just walks the buyers through the purchase contract or through the whole
[00:27:01] Home buying process
[00:27:05] Then I have the buyer advisory my TC also sends this but I would rather than my buyers have this immediately
[00:27:13] So that way because this is lengthy right according to your to your MLS
[00:27:18] This is going to be a pretty beefy one and it helps out a lot
[00:27:21] Common physical conditions in the property that a buyer should investigate. I want them to know that
[00:27:27] And I don't want them to only hear it from me in my videos. I want them to see oh this is you know a statewide thing
[00:27:33] I maybe I should get a sewer scope. Yes, you should
[00:27:37] So that is that's all the attachments that I have in buyer email number two and I think I'm going to leave it here
[00:27:44] So again, I there's no way I can go through every single item on
[00:27:50] This just this first segment segment of my trello checklist
[00:27:54] but
[00:27:55] Again, if you text training to 520 341 2552
[00:28:00] It takes you through every single thing now. I don't have all scripts on here
[00:28:06] But I have a couple of just questions to ask to not forget everyone in my eXp down mine
[00:28:12] They have asked us to a lot more information than this. I have a two almost 200 page
[00:28:17] Real estate Bible Google Doc, which has everything that I know about real estate sales and I mean everything
[00:28:23] But that is exclusive to them. However the most important portions some of the most important portions of it
[00:28:30] Is they're all on the on the checklist that I'm sharing with you today?
[00:28:34] So if you'd like more you know what to do you know what to text if you have any questions or I don't know
[00:28:40] Like want to schedule a one-on-one. I'm here for that. It's calendar.com slash Gar said realty
[00:28:45] I super hope this helps the next the next a training is going to be on the
[00:28:52] Part two of working with a buyer will go over emails number three and four look forward to see you then
[00:29:15] Bye

I'm going to make it I'm going to vocalize as much as I can so in that way It's as if you are following along so I'll start with what is even trello right trello is a free project management System you could use your CRM, but I started using trello because it was free and I kind of just stuck with that So I'm going to show you and vocalize how I have this laid out Starting from the very left side I have a whole section for sellers and then a whole section for buyers and then a section for referrals as well and What I do for those in my downline is I give them access straight to this trello checklist they can copy and paste it but For those that are outside of my downline I will be sending you a link to it So that way you can have access to but not the full access that I've given that I've poured my heart and soul into for my downline specifically so On the left hand side here I have it I have sellers and buyers broken into three different columns So one is like far out sellers that I'm calling like sea sellers B sellers is you know three to six months out Again to make sure that you're hitting everyone on a on that specific tempo Then I have the third column is a seller is getting ready to list You know you need to go on an appointment today and meet with them then I have One week before going live the next column is once they are live on the market the next column is once they're under contract Because again as you start getting more and more you know properties under contract and working with more buyers and sellers to scale You're gonna get overwhelmed so you need to have this organization in the beginning So as if you've never used trello you can like drag and drop little cards so you can you know as soon as someone's under contract and then they're They're out a week out from closing just a drag and drop the card now You know the numbers change for how many are about a week out from closing? And the next column is the size of for sellers then on the buyer side which I will be focusing on today is How I work through my buyers so again C buyers about a year out But be buyers about six months out ish and then a buyers hot buyers or hot leads talks on today Then of course under contract has its own column one week out from closing Once they're closed for 2023 or whatever year we're in when you're listening to this then an archived one closed But in the past you know before or further out then a year ago if that makes sense and then I also have a dead lead pot column as well and then I go into the referrals I have everything consolidated onto this trello board again. This was for this was for the downline so they can just see how I Organize things I would show you mine. It is crazy It has the same exact thing but in order to make this as clear and Easy for you to follow along and for the agents to follow along in my crew I made it as simple as possible. So this is a template. So let's start Let's open up this trello checklist And in the beginning here is the source that's the first thing you need to be tracking is who is giving you business Where is your business coming from because that is what you want to replicate double down on you know if it's all coming from Zillow Then double down on Zillow if it's all coming from a couple people that you know that consistently give you business You show them some love give them some gifts and And say thank you. So you need to know you need to track Because I'm such a huge proponent of tracking everything a track where your leads are coming from So then of course I have like just the typical questions of What you're gonna be asking what you need to know once you're starting to work with the buyer? I have some attachments here. They might not apply to everyone because this is a buyer broker specifically for our area Critical dates list of course. This might not apply to you, but that's okay You can include your own attachments And then buyer Initiation this is the first portion of the checklist. So I have my checklist Sorted into different segment segments. So when we first start talking to a buyer First thing is add them to your calendar add them to your CRM. So that way you know to follow up at what tempo What are the notes of what you previously previously said? The second for the second portion here is Take the intake from the calendar and this is what I used to have as buyer email number one For my buyers. I have buyer emails one through six. It's canned. It's template. It's evergreen So I just copy and paste all I do is just change this who the recipient is for But I used to have this as buyer email number one now what I do is I send all buyers to my calendar Calendly is a paid service. It's about a hundred and sixty dollars a year I highly recommend you sign up for it in case you haven't already but and if you want to follow along there too with Whether you're looking at the screen or not You can go on mine and copy the exact questions that I have it's open to the public So if you go on calendly.com slash gar said realty that's spelled g-a-r-c-e-d realty slash buyer We'll see exactly what my buyers are filling out before they meet with me. So I'll show you here Go as if you're going to be booking an appointment. I'm getting their name email number. I have a Next up is the box that says, you know, will you be selling another home before during this this next purchase? Yes or no if yes What's that address with the zip code of the home you'll be selling because when we meet at the time that they scheduled for I'll be asking if they want a REALTOR in that area to help them sell their home before they purchase with us What's the reason that you're buying and selling? Then I also have I also ask what are the top three must-haves very important as you all know What are the top three wants? What are the top three deal breakers and The catch all is there anything else that you'd like me to know to be better prepared for our meeting? so This they might come out with something out of life field better that they put it in this calendly now before your appointment with them instead of You know on the fly where you might not know the answer and you could have research it beforehand And this last section is for them to send text messages for Calendly to send text to the whoever's booking the call What this is only portion one right? I'm not I'm not going to go into Calendly today Although I can on a on a next beating If you guys wish but in the back end of Calendly I also Go into the work flows tab Because I want to make sure that I'm not going to be stood up So I have the automatic email and text send out to the buyers or send out to anyone who books with me Saying thanks for you know confirming you know we're on for xyz you scheduled this this specific type of meeting And then I also have a 24 hour out meeting in case they book out more than a day out and then I also have the hour before It sends them a text it sends them an email saying hey, we look forward to seeing you in one hour for the home buying consultation So let's go back to my trello checklist That is what I have all the buyers fill out. This is what used to be in my buyer email number one So I will not be covering by email number one because instead now I have calendly saved so much time So you take the information of what they put in the buyer appointment And you start looking you know you already start thinking about what kind of homes are looking at who's going to be in the meeting Etc So then going down this checklist here Ask the the buyers before going under contract with them This is while you are meeting with them over zoom and I meet with everyone over zoom because a lot of my A lot of my meet and potatoes clients are actually out of state So because I do have a military background so a lot of them are PCSing is what they call moving in the military So but then I got used to that and I figured that that was such a Better time spent even if they are local in the area nobody wants a drive to an office nobody want That's just a power move, I think so save the time for them and for you meet over zoom and That is where you go over a couple of questions even more questions Because count only only allows 10 questions So that's where you ask them how often do you expect to hear from me? What how can I be the best agent for you and a lot of agents have issues with that question because it kind of like Shifts the power dynamics if they if you want to call it that but don't forget that not only are they interviewing you as an agent You are interviewing them as clients do not work with someone that doesn't make you feel good, you know There there is so much business to be had especially now that so many REALTORS are leaving the business Scoop up the rest of the business Don't don't be afraid to say no because they're every single client that you take on I'm probably preaching to the choir here, but every single client that you take on that You don't feel good about you know you have like that Like those bad butterflies in your stomach whenever they call you or text you that is a Sure sign that you are not meant to be working together and that is okay Let them go because all the time that you're spending with them is time that you could be spending with other clients that make you feel good So anyway Then also ask them what's the best method of communication of course because some people only like phone calls of course as you guys know I don't like phone calls, but if they do I guess what I'm doing phone calls Text email whatever it is what I like about Trello is I can add these notes to the very very top So as your Trello board gets busier as you're adding other clients here you can easily You know see say Emma buyer in this city or this type of property text or call So that way you don't have to remember. Oh does Emma like tax? Let me look at that. Call and lean. Let me see that email that came in. No, it says right there Emma likes text messages Then add them to your CRM over here. I have kvCORE and I love kvCORE I didn't in the beginning, but wow like I really really like I I only know about 30% of what it Handles and I'm actually testing this out too So if if you want a copy of this checklist and you haven't already reached out to me on on social media text the word checklist to 520 341 2552 more than happy to send it to you Then of course you want to contact the lender or connect them to a lender. I usually do like a group chat with the lender Then of course suck them up on a search next on the Trello checklist is check in three days after setting them up on the search and this is I also have set up on my CRM so as I add each client into the CRM in kvCORE specifically and I'm sure others do the same thing I add task so in three days from when we met I'm going to add a task to notify me to reach out to the client saying hey Did you like everything on the on the search? Is there anything I could switch super easy for us to do so just let us know want to make sure we're not sending you trash so Then here as you can tell next step is I had to send by your emails 1 and 2 now of course by email number 1 no longer exists So let me know what let me change that right here send email number 2 Let me show you email number 2 what does buyer email number 2 have Ali well, let me show you I Use superhuman. It's a way to do a lot of shortcuts, but you can do the same thing With just had saving this as a template on either Gmail or Outlook whatever you use but Templated emails do not be copying or do not be writing the same email over and over again That's not a way to scale and you want to be able to scale. I imagine if you're listening to this so right here in two seconds. I pulled up buyer email number 2 and It's the title is we're excited to work with you because what buyer email number 2 is is the confirmation That you and I are working together exclusively. You're not going to be using another REALTOR So therefore buyer email number 2 is very important for me because this is the mean potatoes Everything I poured my heart and soul into this email into everything really that I do checklist everything and This has this is the way ahead. I show them the eggs I show them everything of what buying a home is like in this market So I started off with a video this video is evergreen. It's not a specific to I don't say any names I don't say any specific information because I want this video to be evergreen and used for every single buyer email number 2 In this in this video You'll see that I actually all I do is go over all of the words in the email because if buyers are to get An email like this nobody likes reading anymore So even if you make a video of you reading what you are sending them they will watch that Better, you know, they will watch that they will feel better instead of giving them homework Hey read this whole long email and You know, that's it. So I go over in this video what exactly I'm relaying to them in words of that email Starting with number one what to do right now. I give them homework, you know buyers want to be told what to do even even if they are Investors that have you know purchased multiple properties before they want to know think about it as a buyer What is the next step what do you want for me? What do I need to do and what's next? Always think about that like what do they need to be hearing from me a lot of agents are too scared to add their To assigning them homework and I tell them straight up buyers. This is your homework So what to do now is complete the buyer or open the complete buyer client PDF This contains the entire step-by-step on how to purchase a property and boy does it You'll see number two before I open and I'll open all the attachments at the end Number two is message me if you've already had other agents show you properties We do not overstep or steal clients because if they have that if for some reason they really don't like them then I want to reach out to that agent and make sure because that agent might not even know and a lot of agents are too scared to do this I don't care. I do not steal clients. I tell everyone in my crew like we do we do there's so much shadiness that happens in this industry Don't make it worse if you are working with another agent excellent then work with that agent We are going to focus our time on other clients that only want to work with us and I have no issue saying that And believe it or not. I've only ever lost two clients because of that and that's okay number three is Walk through the purchase contract was which is attached and with this video that I made for you This needs to be reviewed before we place offers number four is check your jump folder In case the listings that we send to you through that through our website through the MLS Is sent to your junk Number five is review the seven ways to make your offer standout video Number six review the buyer advisory on due diligence best practices Number seven send us your pre approval or proof of funds we cannot take the next steps without that and Then Following this email here. I have once again whenever you have a property that you like based off the emails that we send you Please do the following. This is what you do once you find a property that you like one Make sure it's in a location where you'd like it to be I cannot talk about you know as as you know Realters cannot talk about what area is safe So instead what we can do is give you the resources for you to figure that out on your own So this is a list of schools For you to do your research if schools are important This is spotcrime.com Maps.google.com drop the little yellow guy walk the neighborhood virtually in case you're not already there Make sure it's within your pre approval amount Ensure your spouse or all other buying parties uproot and Sure the numbers work for you. Let's connect it with your lender That's why I do a group text with the lender And if you're serious about it enough to make an offer and I tell this over the zoom call with my buyers If it's a level seven or above out of 10 like 10 as you really want that property if you want to make an offer on it That's when you send it to us. That's when you start taking a look So the wise there's no point of seeing a house that you only halfway are interested in anything under seven Don't send it then I tell them that Then number six. I'll look up all of the agent notes I'll send all the information to you any attachments that they have read it over That's number seven and number eight. Let's get you in their ASAP I try to kill the deal before it even starts if you can't tell because there's no point of seeing a house of Contact in the listing agent if the buyer is a VA loan and they're not even accepting VA loans Of course you're gonna ask hey was that was a fluke was this a typo? But I try to kill the deal before it starts save your time save your sanity Then as again, I reiterate it. There's no point of driving to view a property That's out of your budget in an area you don't like so make sure it is a hell yes and The purpose of this video is to make sure is because I wish I had more information when I was a buyer So I want to send you as much information as I can Hopefully not talking too fast Then of course an every single email that I have I have a way ahead This is what to expect next that's always what clients questions are What to expect next so next expect next by email number three, which will be sent as me a closer to drafting your offer I have one two three four five six six attachments in this buyer email number two That might sound like a lot, but again, I'd rather I'd rather send them only information now So that way they have it and they can review at their own leisure as opposed to later on when they're rushed Let's start with the beefiest one buyer client PDF now as you can tell if you're following along here this took a lot of work I did not make this PDF I hired somebody to do it because I am not digitally creative like this But it's in in pretty in pretty your format, you know, there's colors on here It's a little photo of me what I'm about that I used to be in the military I invest these are some podcasts that I've been on Casey wanted to learn a little bit more about me Then I have another video on page two page three of just a welcome introduction This is me. I'm excited to work with you page four is what you can expect what the buyer can expect from me Communication guidance local knowledge market expertise Number five page five is what I could expect from them submitted prequel You know before viewing properties. We cannot do that until I have your prequel and it's you know up to date That I also expect that they drive the neighborhood if there's a local area before we view that property that on the inside I expect that they see the property on the outside a lot of people might think oh, you know You're telling the buyer did you to do too much? Trust me. I've only ever gotten positive feedback about this like oh wow no one's ever told me to do that. That's a good idea It is it's a great idea Mike out there for my dad Some of the investors will so I want to know what's going on at 11 p.m. On a Friday And I tell them hey if you want to go extra credit if you go at At midnight on a Saturday night to see if you're actually comfortable in that area that you're interested in So of course you can follow you can went if you text me again the the keyword is going to be text training for a copy of everything here to 520 341 2552 so following along general information my work hours. This is how You know we're going to be communicating then the real Process starts where I have video after video three videos per page on talking them through the whole buying process buyer client expectations home buying process But what it's like to buy a mark to buy a house in this market shopping for a lender It's exactly what I do when I shop for a lender purchase contract overview and what is the specific market like right now Then four steps that buyers forget to make when placing offers and guess what guess where I thought of these four steps my own Personal mistakes. So don't make the mistakes I was making So make sure that their your buyers see this seven ways to make your offer stand out now I should probably update this one because this last one had the love letters, which I do not do anymore. I do not recommend And then under contract I'm under contract now what that's always a question, right and then at the bottom I you know follow me on my socials. I'm telling the buyer's ease. I'm not telling you this. You kind of you want to it's alley the agent so Um, that's the beefies attachment next is the word doc which I think my computer might freeze if I open So but what I have here is the what you can expect from me now What do I have here? It's a video that is already on the buyer client pdf That pdf has everything in a video series of what the buyer needs to make to make an offer and to work with me so the what you can expect from me attachment the second attachment is Exactly what I have already mentioned previously. It's just an award doc so they can follow along my work hours You know this is what I expect then The other two attachments are specific to this local area It's the purchase contract or in some states and I offered a purchase But whatever the purchase contract is in your area. I attached that I attached that buyer email number two But really it's their first email at their getting so that way right off the bat They see how formal it is Then I also attached the additional clause in case they need to Do anything outside of the original Contract so for example up wave the appraisal anything like that Then I also have the buyers road map Which is just a one-pager color, you know pretty looking thing. It's a wheel that just walks the buyers through the purchase contract or through the whole Home buying process Then I have the buyer advisory my TC also sends this but I would rather than my buyers have this immediately So that way because this is lengthy right according to your to your MLS This is going to be a pretty beefy one and it helps out a lot Common physical conditions in the property that a buyer should investigate. I want them to know that And I don't want them to only hear it from me in my videos. I want them to see oh this is you know a statewide thing I maybe I should get a sewer scope.
