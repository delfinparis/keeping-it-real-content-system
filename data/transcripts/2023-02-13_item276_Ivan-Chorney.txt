[00:04:40] the show. Welcome. Hey, man. Thanks so much for having me. That was like the warmest, toastiest welcome.
[00:04:46] I like my glowing over here. That's why I was making you laugh in the background all the time.
[00:04:52] Yeah, I know it is. People do it all the time. Because it can be, you know, it's like not always
[00:04:58] something that people are used to hearing is all their credits kind of at once. I know it would
[00:05:03] make me very uncomfortable if someone were reading mine. So I definitely, I definitely understand
[00:05:08] the urge to sort of have fun with it. And also it was just that just your personality. I think
[00:05:13] that's great. Yeah, let's, so I always love to start at the beginning of the story. So I'm curious
[00:05:21] of how you got into, well, first of all, you just got into real estate. So I know you started as
[00:05:28] a sales rep for a developer, but how did you, how did that come about?
[00:05:33] So I actually, I moved to Miami in 2005. I had been in LA for four and a half years. And
[00:05:43] I was, you know, kind of doing odd jobs in Miami to fill up the time and also, you know, make a little
[00:05:49] bit of money. I was also, I was bartending for a staffing company. And one of the assignments was
[00:05:59] to bartend at the launch party for a new development called, called Canyon Ranch in Miami Beach.
[00:06:07] So, you know, so I'm bartending this party and it's a launch and it's just glamorous and like,
[00:06:13] just great looking people dressed in the nines. Sure. And I'm like, I'm like, this is cool. I'm like,
[00:06:21] this is cool. All these people are cool. And they're having, they're having an awesome time. I'm like,
[00:06:27] I'm like, this is, this is what I think I need to do. Yeah. And I'd already been working on my
[00:06:34] license because I was like, all right. And maybe I'll, you know, use some of my money to invest. I
[00:06:38] was like, talking to my buddy and saying, Peter's bird. Yeah. Well, it's like, it's like every third
[00:06:43] person in Florida has a license, you might as well get one anyway. Yeah, right. Might as well. Might as
[00:06:48] old jump in. And so while I was there, I spoke to the broker who was like just the coolest dude, he had
[00:06:55] like, you know, the frosted blonde tips were, which were back really, they were really in back then.
[00:07:00] Sure. I mean, I even had them like a few years before that. Sure. I can't judge. But I was like,
[00:07:08] you know, so I just told him I was like, I want to hang my license for you. I want to work on new,
[00:07:12] on new construction. I'm like, what's it going to take? He's like, well, you know, how many people
[00:07:16] in your database? I'm like, what's a database? And he's like, how much experience do you have in
[00:07:22] sales? And I'm like, well, I was a personal trainer. My ex-old membership sales. That's sales?
[00:07:27] Yeah, that's sales. It was something. And anyway, you know, you like me. I was obviously, you know,
[00:07:34] somewhat personable. And he said, listen, you know, come, come meet with my office manager and we'll
[00:07:40] figure something out. So I went met with the office manager. They, you know, they let me be a sales
[00:07:45] associate on, you know, in their brokerage, which, you know, basically didn't cost them anything. I
[00:07:49] just was there. Sure. And I just made a point of like going in every day to the office,
[00:07:55] going to every sales meeting, you know, which were often held at these new construction projects.
[00:08:01] And constantly asking like, when was there going to be a project for me? I was like, you know,
[00:08:06] I was like, if you've saw, if you've seen Shroff Shank redemption, just talk about like,
[00:08:10] I'm sending the letters to get the library. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they finally just gave in. Well,
[00:08:14] that was like, me, I was like, when am I going to get a project? When am I going to get a project?
[00:08:18] So I ended up getting getting on a project in Miami Beach, which was like, it was not the
[00:08:24] most high end project that they had, but it was kind of like, all right, we'll try you out here.
[00:08:29] And I was put on it with two very seasoned agents. And I quickly outsold them and I was the,
[00:08:36] I was a star sales agent on that team. Wow. What a, what a, what a, that's an amazing story.
[00:08:43] Because number one, you were, you know, approached somebody at an event where, you know, you were
[00:08:50] the hired help. And then also, of course, working on your license at the same time, but just
[00:08:54] having the confidence to say to a, you know, to someone there, like, I want to work with you.
[00:09:00] In some ways, I think that's like every employer's like fantasy situation where somebody's like
[00:09:05] that motivated, where even in a scenario where it's not a real estate, specific sort of meeting for
[00:09:13] you and him, you're still having the confidence to go like, I want this. And I, and so it's, I'd love to
[00:09:19] say like, oh, I'm surprised that they would take a chance on you because of not having that
[00:09:24] particular background. But now that I think about it, it actually makes perfect sense because it
[00:09:29] wasn't a time where they would expect for somebody to come up who isn't yet in the industry and be
[00:09:33] like, I want to work with you. I wonder how much of that just played in, you know.
[00:09:38] Yeah. I mean, then, you know, and even now, you know, years later, 17 years later, and you know,
[00:09:44] having this great team and everything, agents are constantly approaching us to come
[00:09:49] sure with us. I mean, and, you know, we just brought on a guy a couple of months ago. He was on
[00:09:54] me for a year to join the team. And I was like, no, sorry, wrong time. We're not looking for anybody.
[00:10:00] He was relentless. And I finally was like, Mike, I'm like, I got to give this guy a shot. I'm like,
[00:10:05] I like this guy. He was an athlete. He keeps, keeps checking in with me. He wants to take me out for
[00:10:10] coffee. I'm like, I'm like, we need this kind of tenacity in the work, you know, in the agent
[00:10:17] side of things. And that's a quote I repeat to my team all the time is how you do anything is how
[00:10:22] you do everything. So we know that that will correlate to how they will be as an agent.
[00:10:28] I was trying to think I know a bunch of college athletes that have become REALTORS. I mean,
[00:10:34] some of them I've had on the show who are now top of the mountain REALTORS. But even just people
[00:10:38] who are newer to the industry who have that background where they played some some level of college
[00:10:43] sports, they always succeed at in real estate. And it's like I've yet to meet somebody who I know
[00:10:50] for sure played some sort of sport and then failed at real estate. I haven't met those, but I'm sure
[00:10:55] they exist. But boy, there's something about that discipline and that just hard work and tenacity
[00:11:00] where they're kind of like, yeah, I just going to I'm going to do the same effort I put into,
[00:11:04] you know, my sport into this. And I mean, you know, as well as I do, anyone who puts that kind of
[00:11:09] commitment in is guaranteed almost guaranteed to be successful. Yeah, no, totally. That's that spot on.
[00:11:14] And even, you know, just having a tolerance for discomfort, you know, whether that whether
[00:11:20] that's just being in like uncomfortable positions, you know, just like having to grind and, you know,
[00:11:26] like, and sometimes do things that you don't want to do. Like all that stuff just, you know,
[00:11:31] keeps building character and that ends up like, you know, being the building blocks for, you know,
[00:11:36] like, at least for me, those were the building blocks, building blocks of my success.
[00:11:40] Yeah, I mean, mine too, this idea of of learning how to tolerate discomfort. I mean, it's like,
[00:11:47] you're a personal trainer. I just actually came from the personal trainer just for this.
[00:11:52] And it's all about, it's all your advice. No, I won't. But I'm too, too,
[00:11:58] me just embarrassed to do that. But, but it is, it is wild because I'm almost three years in.
[00:12:04] And I never had that level of commitment to working out. I just didn't my whole life. And so,
[00:12:09] I'm like, I got to get a trainer. And I will tell you that it's no, it's still not fun because
[00:12:15] it's pain. I mean, it's painful. But it is, it is, it is, it is looked at me how to tolerate
[00:12:22] discomfort physically. That physical discomfort of like, this is going to be painful. And there's
[00:12:27] a huge benefit to doing it. And if I can just go, well, the benefit is going to outweigh whatever
[00:12:32] the short term pain is. And that's, it doesn't mean everyone needs to start like lifting heavy weights.
[00:12:37] But the idea of getting comfortable with whatever, with a physical discomfort or a mental discomfort
[00:12:43] or whatever it is, is so critical for being successful because this is a business that really
[00:12:48] can knock you down pretty fast and, and pretty hard. I mean, all it takes is, you know, you,
[00:12:53] you find out your best friend went with a different REALTOR or, or, you know, you just, you lose
[00:12:58] a deal for whatever reason. It's not your fault. It's easy. It's easy. And we all do.
[00:13:03] We all do. There's all kinds of, all kinds of roadblocks, you know, near, near big deals that just
[00:13:10] didn't happen. And, and it, you know, it's, it's really tough at the time, especially when you,
[00:13:16] you haven't kind of crossed over that, that kind of luxury or that level of success. And you're
[00:13:22] just trying to find your way to climb through and you miss those deals and it's tough. But it does
[00:13:28] build character. And, and that's a, you know, that's the stuff I lean on now in my success.
[00:13:34] Yeah, it's, I think resiliency is just like the name of the game with this one. It's just,
[00:13:39] you're going to get knocked down constantly. And, and just this idea of like, it's all going to work
[00:13:44] out. I'm just going to keep at it. And, and it, it usually, usually is a lot of that. It's
[00:13:50] just sort of there. It's as you know. So, so I'm probably speaking for the audience here because,
[00:13:56] and they, I think they understand the, that your story starts with, with you sort of having this,
[00:14:01] this opportunity in a sense that you jumped on when you were not, not in the industry at that moment.
[00:14:07] But for anyone that is in the industry right now, and I think, I think I don't have an idea of
[00:14:12] what you're going to say, but I don't want to say it for you because I might be wrong. But I'm
[00:14:15] curious. And if anyone listening is going, I want to be, to be chosen to be, to, you know,
[00:14:21] work some any any kind of developer does. Maybe it's luxury. Maybe it isn't. But I would like to be
[00:14:26] chosen to represent a developer in some of these transactions. I know here in Chicago, that is like,
[00:14:31] you know, it is, and there's pros and cons to being chosen too. I know it's not all wine and roses.
[00:14:37] But it is certainly something that people aspire to at least the option of being chosen. So I'm
[00:14:43] curious what you would suggest to somebody who wants to start taking steps to get the eye of
[00:14:49] developers. You know, there is a little bit of a difference from when I started in, you know,
[00:14:57] basically 2006 to now, you know, when I got into the business, there were there were agents that
[00:15:04] literally did nothing but work on developments. Sure. You know, like, and I had a friend who
[00:15:11] worked on a project with me and he basically said it this way, you have, you have house cats and
[00:15:16] you have street cats. And he's like, he's like, I'm a house cat. He's like, I'm never going to be a
[00:15:20] street cat street cat. And, and obviously, I was a house cat at the time. Now I'm a street cat. But,
[00:15:26] you know, so it's like, you know, they were two very distinct groups. Now we've got these indoor
[00:15:33] outdoor cats. And we find that, you know, I find that a lot of the best developers, the top
[00:15:41] developments, they want seasoned agents that are actually out there in the street, you know, mixing
[00:15:47] and mingling with top clients, you know, from here and around the world. And also, you know,
[00:15:54] socializing with all the other top agents so that they can mix with those agents and have those
[00:15:58] agents bring their clients in. So it's an even more coveted and harder spot to get. But I would say
[00:16:07] to, I would say two ways. One, find like an entry entry level kind of project. It might even be,
[00:16:14] you know, working for like culture homes. You know, you have some sales experience. You got your
[00:16:19] license like, you're willing to sell way out in the burbs and just like, you know, like selling,
[00:16:25] just a box of homes, you know, or or or or some kind of real estate. That would be kind of like one
[00:16:32] way and then you just work your way up. Be sure the absolute best in every one of those situations.
[00:16:38] And you'll plot, you'll plot your own course. The other one is, you know, is the team route.
[00:16:43] And I would say get yourself on a team, you know, because I say the three keys to mastery are
[00:16:49] the immersion, modeling and repetition. So if you're in the team and you're now immersing,
[00:16:56] immersing yourself and there should be other stuff with that, but you're doing that. You've got
[00:17:00] the leaders, the other people on the team, you know, you're modeling after and then you just
[00:17:05] keep repeating, repeating, repeating. Then that's going to build the backbone of kind of the
[00:17:09] substance that developers are going to look for. And then you'll start having some of the,
[00:17:16] you know, the sales experience, you'll start having some of the, you'll know some of the talk,
[00:17:21] you can talk the talk. And I think you'll have put together a database and all those kind of variables
[00:17:27] that developers look for. And you might get a little bit of a leg up and be able to skip over culture
[00:17:32] homes and go right into working a lower Miami project. Yeah, that makes that really makes perfect
[00:17:39] sense. Yeah, I think I agree with all of that. And I also think too, like I don't want to
[00:17:46] minimize how hard it is for you to do that even today because it's not like once you're in,
[00:17:54] you're in because you have to perform and deliver every single time and the stakes are really high
[00:17:59] for you because there's a line of agents, gosh, a mile long that would love to take your spot
[00:18:04] on some of those development deals. And you're in an ultra competitive market. In fact,
[00:18:11] you could argue Miami might be the number one real estate market in the world or in the country
[00:18:16] as far as was amount of dollars that sort of exchange hands. And the most resilient too, I must say.
[00:18:23] Yeah, well, it is, it is, yeah, it's like this time of year, I always think,
[00:18:30] Florida's, there's a lot of benefits to tax. There's a lot going for Miami. Miami is just
[00:18:39] transforming so rapidly, just getting better and better. Yeah, I was there about two years ago,
[00:18:46] I hadn't been to Miami in that time and was staying in Don on South Beach and just love what's
[00:18:53] been done down there. So that's, I think that's really helpful advice. It's all the same things
[00:19:00] that I think we've heard from other agents on the show, but I don't think that means it's,
[00:19:09] repetition, as you said, one of the three components, it's the mother of skill. It's doing the same thing.
[00:19:15] That's the mother of mastery. Yeah, it is, I think. It is.
[00:19:19] So this idea of just putting the blinders on and going for it and developing skills, I think it's
[00:19:27] you're right. When you play at that level, the skill is really, really important. And skills can
[00:19:32] be honed in sharpened, right? So it's this idea of just working at it. Let's talk about the relationships,
[00:19:40] because you have a really, when you work with developers, that's a really difficult thing,
[00:19:45] because you're serving many masters, really. You're obviously keeping the developers happy,
[00:19:50] trying to sell at the rate that they want, with the pricing that they want, also dealing with other
[00:19:55] REALTORS, dealing with buyers, and all sorts of factors. So I know there's, it does not mean that
[00:20:02] it's an easy job at all working on developments or with developers. But I'm curious on,
[00:20:10] sort of, as your team has continued to grow, where do you find the most joy? Do you like working with
[00:20:17] the developers, with the public, with both? Curious on what's like your favorite thing?
[00:20:25] Yeah, I mean, as I said, I was a house cat, and then I moved out onto the street, and I'm
[00:20:34] actually happier being a street cat. I like being out there in the world, I like mixing and
[00:20:39] mingling, and I don't like being kind of just like to, not always like stuff, but just like,
[00:20:46] you know, just to focus on one project, because, you know, Miami is so dynamic and so versatile,
[00:20:54] and there's so many great real estate opportunities that I love selling everything.
[00:21:00] So, you know, right now, what I prefer to do, I want to work with, I want to work with people,
[00:21:07] I just love working with great people. When I first started in membership sales,
[00:21:15] for a gym, it was a different kind of sales. It was like using techniques,
[00:21:22] choosing techniques, and I remember the first time I used a closing technique, to close somebody,
[00:21:30] and they bought a membership, and then I realized that they weren't coming in, and that I basically
[00:21:35] sold them, like, I didn't like it, I didn't feel good about it. What I do now is relationships
[00:21:42] house. Like, first I'm selling me, like, do you want to work with me? Like, here's all the reasons why,
[00:21:47] because I'm going to be a trusted resource, I'm a property matchmaker, I'm going to put you with
[00:21:52] the most amazing property. But, you know, I want to become their friend, I want to, I mean, because
[00:21:59] I truly deeply care about them, and that's what gives me the satisfaction, because I know,
[00:22:04] in the end, I've helped put them in their family in a place where they're just, they're going to have
[00:22:09] the best lifestyle, like, the best lifestyle that's going to match their needs. So, so that's
[00:22:14] what really, like, you know, turns my crank, so to speak. Yeah, that's your why. You like, you like,
[00:22:19] giving, there's a lot of satisfaction in that. And so, I'm curious, because you're talking about
[00:22:27] wanting to become, you know, friends and develop these sort of intimate relationships with clients,
[00:22:33] and really deep and continue to deepen them so that, you know, they continue to, you know,
[00:22:38] obviously, be part of your life. I'm curious, I'm always curious on what, what are you doing,
[00:22:44] or what do you recommend doing in between sales with a client, so that, you know, you just sold
[00:22:50] somebody a home, they moved in, it's their dream home, it might be their forever home, or, or at
[00:22:55] least their for a while home. What are you doing so that to make sure that they don't forget about
[00:23:00] one year, two years, three years, and just, I always think, you know, this is a huge opportunity,
[00:23:06] and probably something that a lot of agents struggle with. It's like, okay, transaction over,
[00:23:10] I know I should stay in touch. I'm not exactly sure how often and what, and what to do. Yeah,
[00:23:16] great point. That's, I think that's vital, because, you know, you know, you don't want to be a one-pump
[00:23:23] chump. Not only do you want that repeat business, but you want them to tell their, you know,
[00:23:31] their friends and their family, and you want, and you just, I don't know for me, I just, I want to know
[00:23:39] how they're doing down the road. So, I think it's, you know, hard systems, like, you gotta have
[00:23:46] systems in place. That's, you know, your CRM, you gotta have your CRM working. For me, delegating,
[00:23:52] when I started really delegating and spending money on delegating, that was, that was hugely
[00:23:58] transformative, you know, having assistance helping you do stuff, and they help us with follow-up
[00:24:06] in a major way, whether it's emails, text messages, sending gift, sending letters. So, that's
[00:24:12] kind of the whole kick and kaboodles that, like, you know, we're sending them gifts on their
[00:24:16] birthday, we're sending them cards, we're calling them, we're checking in, you know, every,
[00:24:21] every couple of weeks, you know, it's just saying hello, you know, how are they enjoying their place?
[00:24:26] Did they hear about this thing that's going on? We sent them articles, oh, the top 10 restaurants in
[00:24:31] Miami, we texted it over to them where we have our assistance text over in the home. So, we're,
[00:24:36] we're just, you know, constantly trying to be, I was saying, we're trying to be like an eternal
[00:24:41] resource as well. That is such a, you know, it's so funny, this top 10, this top restaurants thing,
[00:24:47] it sounds so simple, and yet in all of the interviews I've had over all of the years, I don't think
[00:24:53] anyone specifically gave that particular tip, and I just realized, as you were saying it,
[00:24:57] what a brilliant tip it is, because you can just make it neighborhood specific to wherever they,
[00:25:02] they live, and this is really an endless amount of content. I mean, you could say, you could do
[00:25:08] restaurant of the week, or you could do top three restaurants, or whatever you want to do it,
[00:25:13] but that is such an easy way to create content that's actually valuable to the people that live
[00:25:20] in those communities, and in a way that's not, hey, I'm looking for another sale, or, you know,
[00:25:25] send me the names of some of your friends, which of course, I'm not criticizing people who do it
[00:25:29] that way either, it's not my particular approach, but I understand that some people do.
[00:25:35] For people that are like, I don't want to bug, bug, I don't really want to bother people,
[00:25:39] it's like, well then send them things of value, and that is a great example,
[00:25:43] totally. And you can do it with your sphere of influence, you could, I mean, it's not that much work,
[00:25:49] but it's not. I would love it if every week I received an email in the neighborhood I live,
[00:25:56] which is Wicker Park, and which has got hundreds of restaurants, I mean, we just have so many restaurants,
[00:26:01] and it can be overwhelming, and I live in the middle of it, and I'm like, God, I would love for
[00:26:04] somebody to be like, this is the place you should go this week. And I mean, I really would. And
[00:26:09] you get that on a Friday, you're like, oh, I'm going to go out tonight or tomorrow night.
[00:26:12] It's like, oh, top 10, like, this place, let's see, oh, that's the food I want, boom.
[00:26:17] I know it's, it sounds silly, but it is like, again, that's, and I'm, guys, I'm not a practicing
[00:26:23] agent, I'm licensed, but I don't practice. So like, I am somebody who is, might be in your database,
[00:26:29] I'm like a person that is like in your database, there's a lot of people like me, they want to know,
[00:26:33] you know, and they don't always necessarily, you know, I think people who own homes are always
[00:26:38] interested in one of my homes worth, but aside from that, I think most, a lot of the communication
[00:26:44] can just be like, hey, how's it going? What are you up to? What are you? And I imagine you do a lot of
[00:26:48] that. Totally, yeah, all the time. I mean, I'm, I, I, I gorge, I gorge on all things my
[00:26:55] image, like I'm just, you know, you can tell, I light up when I talk about the city. It's,
[00:27:01] the city is my second love, you know, so I love sharing things about the city. And when I learn about,
[00:27:07] you know, oh, this, this new rooftop restaurant is coming to Copenhagen Grove, you know, I'm like,
[00:27:13] taking the link and I'm texting and out to all my clients who bought and coconut grove, you know,
[00:27:17] like, yeah. And, and it's just a, it's really like a natural thing for me. And, and, and it obviously
[00:27:22] it perpetuates the relationship, you know, for, for years to come.
[00:27:26] Let's, let's, I want to talk about delegating because you mentioned that that was really a
[00:27:30] game changer for you when you started investing in hiring, you know, or just getting, getting some
[00:27:36] of the things off your plate that maybe weren't the things you really preferred to do or maybe they
[00:27:41] weren't business building things, but things that needed to get done. So I'm curious on, on, you
[00:27:46] know, for there's a lot of people out there listening who are going, I would love to delegate some
[00:27:50] of my work. How do you figure out what you want to delegate and what you want to keep for yourself?
[00:27:55] Mm-hmm. Uh, I think it's pretty easy. What do you, what do you tend to procrastinate on?
[00:28:01] What do you, what do you avoid doing? Delicate that shit. Don't do it. I mean, you know,
[00:28:08] Mike and I joined, joined partners, we've gained partners and, and, you know,
[00:28:14] the first year is like, you're not closing like crazy amounts of deals and, you know, money is
[00:28:20] a little bit tighter and it's like, you know, we were at that point where we were kind of like
[00:28:25] overflowing, you know, like trying to be jacks of all trades, writing contracts, doing follow-up,
[00:28:32] writing listings, like chasing our commissions. I mean, it was fucking hard. I'm sorry,
[00:28:37] I'm sorry. Sure. No, you can swear. It was hard. It was hard and overwhelming. And in it took
[00:28:44] away from my ability to perform at what I'm best at, which is working with people and closing deals.
[00:28:52] Like, I love working with people. I love selling the best of the best real estate in Miami. I love
[00:28:59] going to the projects, you know, talking to the agents, talking to the developers. I don't love
[00:29:04] working on contracts. I don't love the minutiae of like, you know, the, of, um, you know,
[00:29:11] scheduling the inspections and being there at the inspection, like, I don't want to do that stuff. So
[00:29:17] once, once I realized that for myself, Mike and I had a good conversation. He was on board and we
[00:29:23] said, like, let's spend some money and hire somebody to do this shit. And let me tell you, that's
[00:29:30] a game changer. Yeah. If you have not hired somebody to take the load off of you and stuff you
[00:29:37] don't like doing or don't have the time to go on hire somebody. Start with, start with a,
[00:29:43] a virtual admin. If you, you know, if you don't have the budget to go full time somebody, you know,
[00:29:48] in person, get a virtual admin, like it will be a huge game changer for people.
[00:29:53] And, and, and, and really affordable. I mean, you can, you know, depending on the skill level,
[00:29:59] I mean, you can find people as low as, you know, I don't know, $5 an hour, maybe even less. Now,
[00:30:04] obviously, it's not, it's not so much about wanting to spend the least amount of money. But if
[00:30:09] that's your budget, you can find people that'll do it. And, and so, you know, places like Upwork.com
[00:30:15] are great resources where you can go post and add people from all over the world will vie for your
[00:30:21] business. And, you know, you'll have to figure out, you know, who you want to hire. But, um, but yeah,
[00:30:25] I, that's a great option. So for anyone out there that's like, I can't afford to have, you know,
[00:30:30] a full-time assistant. Maybe you can afford not to. Yeah. Well, you're not too. I'm telling you,
[00:30:36] game changer. And, and we should also honor the fact that probably when you guys were ready to make
[00:30:43] that financial commitment initially, was added uncomfortable moment, like, oh my gosh,
[00:30:47] was it a time where you were like, I'm, oh, it was, it wasn't. It was easy for you. No, no, no,
[00:30:52] it was totally, it was hard to start spending like our own money that we were getting. And like,
[00:30:57] you know, as a real estate agent, you're like, you never really know exactly when the next
[00:31:03] piece comment, or maybe know when the next one is, but not the one after that. And so that's,
[00:31:07] that's, that's uncomfortable. And brutal. But it's, it's, it's necessary, man. So, yeah, it's,
[00:31:14] it's, again, it's this idea of betting on yourself and going like, no, this will work out. It might
[00:31:19] be uncomfortable for a while, because I'm spending money. And yeah, there's going to be times of like,
[00:31:24] I got to train and build systems and all of those things. Yes. So you just got to push through
[00:31:30] that discomfort and realize like, oh, top agents aren't doing everything. They're just doing what
[00:31:34] they are, what they love and what they're best at and what's, what's, what's on their own activities.
[00:31:39] Yeah. 100% so, back to relationships for a moment. So, you know, you, you just gave a lot of
[00:31:49] great examples of providing value, you know, in between transactions, you know, staying in touch
[00:31:54] with clients, giving them something that they can use on a regular basis, making sure they don't
[00:31:59] feel neglected, you know, whether it's just reaching out and how's it going, you know, saw you on
[00:32:04] vacation, tell me about it kind of thing versus, you know, hey, here's like some cool real estate
[00:32:08] info or here's some, you know, community info. How important is it to be really immersed in the
[00:32:16] community first? So we all know real estate is usually hyper local for most agents work, you know,
[00:32:22] locally. How important is it to be known in the community and not so much to be like a public figure,
[00:32:27] but just somebody that's in the community and supportive of the community? I imagine you guys are,
[00:32:33] for sure. Yeah. I mean, you know, I guess this is too full to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to,
[00:32:43] know agents that have picked up and left one market, ploughed themselves into another market,
[00:32:48] and found, found it immediate success, you know, so there are ways to do that and they clearly were not
[00:32:55] immersed in, you know, the, in the world, so to speak, of that city yet. It's, it's, it's, it's
[00:33:13] all the things Miami and I mean, and, and in volunteering, you know, like, as you mentioned,
[00:33:20] like I'm a big brother, in big brothers, big sisters, we also, we do a lot of donations to some
[00:33:26] of the, you know, the various big charities in Miami. Lotus House is one that we, we did it,
[00:33:32] we, you know, we got a table for, we invited people, we mixed and mingle. So, you know, it's good
[00:33:37] for people to see that, you know, it's, we're not just about the money, you know, we're also about
[00:33:42] the community, and, and we get out and about and we go to the chamber, we're now and again,
[00:33:47] and, and all that stuff. I, you know, I think it's important. It also, you know, it also kind of
[00:33:53] depends on who your, your client faces, you know, for people that, you know, like, if someone on
[00:33:59] my team was, you know, focused on getting single-family home listings in ex-community, I'd be like,
[00:34:06] you need to start living in that community, you know, like, need to start, you need to start going
[00:34:12] to, you know, the, the weekly moms events or, or you need to, like, start getting plugged into
[00:34:17] the schools and go into the art fair, like, you got to start digging yourself into that. And,
[00:34:23] and, you know, like Mike and I, we deal with mostly, I would say, Northeasterners is a big,
[00:34:30] is a big portion of our clientele, Northeasterners, people, people from Chicago, California, a lot,
[00:34:38] a lot of tax flights, some, some Canadians, some, some Europeans, some South Americans.
[00:34:43] We, we actually, him and I specifically don't have a huge amount of, like, local clients. So, you
[00:34:51] know, for us, it's almost more important for us to be out and about in the world, you know, so,
[00:34:55] so we're traveling to Europe in the summer, you know, trying to go to the Hamptons or, you know,
[00:35:01] going into New York City a lot. I'm kidding. Well, that makes sense. I'm from Connecticut. So,
[00:35:08] so that's, that's, that's kind of how we kind of get out in the, the bigger community so speak.
[00:35:14] That's so interesting. So, you travel to where the potential customers are and, uh, where they
[00:35:20] are today and, and where they might be, obviously, in the future is, is, is Miami. That,
[00:35:26] probably that makes perfect sense. I've yet to hear anybody talk about that specifically,
[00:35:30] about leaving geographically so that you can get in front of potential buyers or,
[00:35:35] yeah, I mean, I mean, I had a, I had a prospect that I'd been in touch with over the phone only and
[00:35:41] he was from Atlanta. The Compass ended up having the Compass retreat in Atlanta. So, I looked them
[00:35:47] up and I said, hey, what are you doing? I'd love to, you know, take out for coffee. He said, no, come over
[00:35:51] my house. So, he invited me over his house, just freaking giant mansion in like one of the most,
[00:35:58] you know, wealthy areas of Atlanta. And we just, I totally hit it off and him and brought his
[00:36:04] wife over. They started pouring me whiskey. I was like, oh my god. So, you know, but it was great
[00:36:09] because like, you know, I, I know as soon as they come to Miami, we're going out and I've cemented
[00:36:14] that relationship. And in the same vein, I'm love to hear your perspective of the importance of
[00:36:22] building strong relationships with other REALTORS, whether they're in your local market and the
[00:36:28] people you, you know, will be on, you know, maybe one side of a deal with against the other,
[00:36:33] working together to close it or even REALTORS from other markets who might be referring clients in.
[00:36:40] How critical is it for you to have strong relationships with other agents?
[00:36:45] Yeah, I mean, it's, it's super critical, I think really for every agent, you know, I know some
[00:36:52] agents that 75% of their business is referrals from other agents. That's not us, but it's actually
[00:37:00] something we're working on growing. We actually have, you know, we've kind of put the structure
[00:37:05] in place to really work on growing our referral network. We're looking for great partners out there.
[00:37:12] But, but you know, that's why we went to, why we went to Atlanta. Jessica paid us who runs our team.
[00:37:19] She's going to Boston this weekend to meet with agents. She was in the York meet with agents.
[00:37:23] Mike was in the York meet with agents. Hate our Michael on our team was meeting with agents in
[00:37:28] New York. So this is really like a big initiative of ours to get out there and meet lots of agents
[00:37:35] from the various feeder markets, you know, around the country, but, you know, really even around the
[00:37:40] world because Toronto, London, you know, there's, there's other feeder markets. But even, even just,
[00:37:45] you know, within Miami, you know, it's very, it's very important, I think, to, to be well-liked,
[00:37:53] you know, to be thought of as somebody who's, um, likable and, and easy to work with, you know,
[00:37:58] because I know from like my side when, when I'm going to show listings and I'm like looking at
[00:38:05] who the, who the agents are, like, there are some occasionally going to be an agent where I go,
[00:38:09] ooh, like, and you never want to be on that end of it. You don't want to be on that end where
[00:38:15] somebody looks at your name. I don't want to be as bad. No. Like, I'm like this, yeah, this person,
[00:38:20] you know, they do this, they do that, like, you know, X tried to steal my client one. Yeah,
[00:38:26] there are a problem. Or they're just, they just don't, they just don't shut up. They just talk,
[00:38:30] talk, talk, talk to clients like, overwhelm. I'm like, there's, there's a few of them out there and,
[00:38:37] my advice is don't be that person. I, there's a, there's a way Adam Corolla used to talk about,
[00:38:44] he goes, you never want to be, it was like a life advice thing and he was saying, you never
[00:38:47] want to be the guy that when your name comes up on the caller ID to someone else, they go, oh,
[00:38:52] God. And that is a good point. Yeah. I mean, like, I get calls from other agents that just asking
[00:39:01] for like, help, like, hey, I saw you close this unit in this building. I have a client who's
[00:39:07] thinking about buying the same unit two floors up. Can you give me some insight? And I'm like,
[00:39:11] absolutely, like, I want to be helpful because, you know, when the shoe is on the other foot,
[00:39:15] maybe I'll need them. And, and, and not the vast majority of agents, not saying the vast majority.
[00:39:22] A lot of agents can't be bothered, you know, they even, a lot of them have just, just bad etiquette,
[00:39:27] they don't answer the phone. I'm like, Miami, for, for, for, as glamorous and wealthiest city as it is,
[00:39:36] I really don't think it's the hardest city to become successful in because you just have to do
[00:39:42] this much more to set yourself above the people that are doing the bare minimum.
[00:39:47] You know, I agree. And you just said something very powerful. And I want to make kind of like,
[00:39:52] step on a little bit because it's so, you just said something actually quite, quite brilliant,
[00:39:56] I think, which was if you are selling this, particularly applies to condo sales, you know,
[00:40:03] this idea that if you're about to list a condo in a building that you haven't listed in before,
[00:40:08] take a look at the closed listings and not just for the data, but actually go, hey, maybe I'll
[00:40:13] reach out to a couple of agents that just closed the deal here and just be like, hey, is there anything
[00:40:17] I need to know? I know you've had success in this building. I would, I'm sorry to bug you, but I'd
[00:40:21] really love to get any advice that you might have. And first of all, that's super flattering to get
[00:40:26] a call like that. It's super flattering. Like, I was, like, it just happened to me last week.
[00:40:30] And I was like, I was just like more than, kind of blown away that somebody thought to do that.
[00:40:35] I wasn't happy. Yeah, because I was like, oh, you know, like, this guy's like looking up to me and he's,
[00:40:40] you know, he's looking at me for help. And I was like, this is this, this is this. And I was completely
[00:40:44] transparent about the deal. And he was like, beyond thankful because like, he didn't know that the
[00:40:49] deal included the boat slip and what that equated to on a, on a, on a dollar level. So it was, it was great.
[00:40:57] Yeah, this, this idea of, I mean, it is, you know, I know you guys weren't on opposite ends of
[00:41:01] the transaction. But even when that happens, it's still a cooperative commission, right? It's
[00:41:05] still supposed to be cooperative. And so I think agents sometimes forget about that when it's,
[00:41:10] when it's just a random agent and at a different, you know, maybe they closed a deal a week before.
[00:41:16] And you're like, I don't want to bother them. They don't know me. I don't know them. It's, yeah.
[00:41:19] I think that's, and if they don't call you back, it's no big deal. But at least you made the effort.
[00:41:23] And again, I think that that idea of, you know, agents who are successful in my experience. And of
[00:41:30] course, there's exceptions to this. But almost all the time that I've dealt with agents who are,
[00:41:36] or top producers, they tend to be super generous and super friendly. And they get it. Everyone's got
[00:41:42] to start somewhere. They remember what it was like. And it's appreciative when, when, when, when
[00:41:47] when somebody calls them and says, Hey, I'd love to get some advice.
[00:41:50] Totally. I, I, besides all this other stuff. And, you know, um, seeing this, seeing my clients
[00:41:57] happy, like the other thing, I get tremendous satisfaction out of helping other people.
[00:42:02] And like helping other people to avoid some of the pitfalls and hurdles that I had to go through.
[00:42:07] And, and I'll say to my team members, like, if, if, if you're experienced on my team, through my,
[00:42:13] your experience on my team, if you don't end up being becoming a better person,
[00:42:18] then you were when you got here, then I'm, then I failed. You know, so like, I really,
[00:42:22] you know, hold myself up to, to, to make, to be a contribution to everybody and to, you know,
[00:42:28] make sure that they leave a better person, a better professional than when they got here.
[00:42:34] I wonder how many of our listeners right now having just heard you say that are thinking,
[00:42:39] I would love it if my team lead or my managing broker or whoever is, is sort of in charge of me as
[00:42:45] an agent said, I want everybody here to become a better human being. And my job is to help you
[00:42:52] become a better human being, not just become successful at real estate. I want to help, you know,
[00:42:57] that is, that is a really powerful thing that you said. And I want to honor that because I don't
[00:43:02] know that every team leader managing broker has that same philosophy. It's, it's certainly a,
[00:43:07] tremendous responsibility that you're taking on. And one that you take very seriously. And so I
[00:43:12] think it's a great place to mention that if somebody is, is a REALTOR in the Miami, sort of,
[00:43:18] Miami data area and, and you're looking to maybe see what other options exist. And you think you
[00:43:24] might be a fit for the Ivan and Mike team. And again, remember, it might take some time because these
[00:43:29] guys want to see a level of commitment and dedication, but you got to start someone. If, if somebody
[00:43:35] was wanting to consider working on your team with your team, providing some value to your team,
[00:43:41] tell me like, what are you looking for in an agent and, and how could they get in touch with you?
[00:43:46] Yeah. Well, I mean, we're not looking for green agents, you know, green as an, an experience
[00:43:53] that doesn't mean it's an absolute no. Nothing is ever an absolute no. You know, this last
[00:43:59] gentleman we brought on, he was green. And that's why it was, it was a no for now, which is also,
[00:44:05] you know, people should be taking notes as far as sales go. No is only no for now.
[00:44:11] But it wasn't no at the time. It became it became a yes because he was tenacious enough. But
[00:44:17] right right out of the gates, we're looking for people that are a little bit more seasoned, you know,
[00:44:24] listing specialists, you know, somebody that can go out there and get single family home listings
[00:44:30] that can go out there and, you know, kind of kill their own prey. Not just that they're not
[00:44:36] just going to sit back and wait for us to be out. Just feeding off of feeding off of. Yeah.
[00:44:40] That's that we're not looking for that, you know, but we're looking for people that
[00:44:44] that want to be part of a team and want to be part of a special team. A team that's more about
[00:44:50] that's not just about the numbers and just about, you know, Gucci, Gucci belts and parties on,
[00:44:57] you know, on South Beach on Friday, like we really, we're about personal development, we're about
[00:45:02] giving back to our community and we really, you know, feel like like we're a family, you know, so
[00:45:08] if you're if you're about that jam, cool. If that's not your jam, that's cool too. Just we're not
[00:45:13] the fit for you. Like I know, I think that's very fair and people they want to, if anyone out there
[00:45:20] wants to reach out to the Ivan and Mike team, you can go to Ivan and Mike.com. We'll have a link to
[00:45:24] that in the show notes or hit them up on Instagram or Facebook. On Instagram, they're only my
[00:45:30] Emmy luxury. I have one last question for you because and it's kind of a funny thing. I get a
[00:45:39] little nervous asking it because I'm always afraid somebody's going to chastise me for for bringing
[00:45:44] up something that might be a bit negative. No, no, no, it's I think it's realistic and I'm just
[00:45:48] curious to get your takes. I think 2023 is going to be a really tough year for agents. I don't
[00:45:53] I don't think I'm going on a limb by saying that. I think, but there's some people that just like
[00:45:56] to see the positive side of everything and they're like, it's going to be fine. We have almost
[00:46:02] that's good. No, that's good because I want to hear that perspective because for me,
[00:46:07] we have about 800 agents here at our company and I'm terrified because I'm like, oh my God,
[00:46:11] rates are up in Ventories down. This is going to be tough. What are you doing to stay positive
[00:46:16] and also stay productive despite the fact that there are definitely challenges right now that
[00:46:21] maybe exist a couple of years ago. Okay, so where attention goes, energy flows, right? So
[00:46:29] if you're constantly focused on the sensationalism that's out there about, you know,
[00:46:37] sorry, housing bubble, bubble bubble, bubble bubble collapse, you know, the housing market is
[00:46:46] bubble is this and I'm like, you know what, it's noise. It's just noise. I'm always reading between
[00:46:54] the lines. I'm looking at the market. I'm I got my boots on the ground here in Miami. We're
[00:46:59] very low in Ventories. So you know what I'm like, I'm focused on the fact that like I know what the
[00:47:05] reality is and I'm focused on the fact that there are still great opportunities out there. So
[00:47:10] I truly believe there are opportunities out there for people and I truly believe there are great
[00:47:14] great products out there for people to buy and that's why I just did 25 million this past weekend
[00:47:20] and three deals. Unbelievable. Three three deals. I was out of the country. I did 25 million.
[00:47:28] And I'm not trying to like say I'm like, you know, this, no, you're not you're not bragging. You're
[00:47:32] just reporting. You're just like I stay positive. I'm I listen, I get up in the morning. I listen to
[00:47:40] to meditation. I have affirmations like I am starting to stand in the garden. I'm standing
[00:47:48] in the garden at the gate of my mind. That's smart. And I just can't let the crap come in. That's
[00:47:53] just noise. Yeah, it's but but when you said something very important, you said, I know the reality.
[00:47:59] It's not like I'm I'm poly and I'm not paying attention. I don't actually know what's going on.
[00:48:03] I know I know what's going on, which is why I'm choosing to focus my energy in things that will
[00:48:08] actually help drive my business because you can't control inventory or rates, but you can find
[00:48:13] opportunity within within those things. But if you're right, if your mind is being entertained by
[00:48:21] information that isn't particularly helpful to actually creating a plan, then it becomes like just
[00:48:27] consumerism. I'm just taking an information and it's going to bum me out because of course it is.
[00:48:32] And it's not like you're not strong enough to push it away. It's just human nature. When you
[00:48:36] absorb things to sort of react to them. And so you know, you said something really important.
[00:48:41] It's like you can pay attention and you can not pay too much attention so that you're immobilized.
[00:48:48] Yeah, exactly. It's like, you know, you're not trying to be like a car salesman. Like nobody wants
[00:48:56] that. Like, you know, and you know, all of our all of our buyers are sophisticated, right? They're
[00:49:06] like, it's all fucking crap. You know, like there's there's some truth in that too. It's just like,
[00:49:12] you know, let me let me understand you and what what your needs are, what what fits your lifestyle.
[00:49:18] Let me present some options and then let me go to work and negotiate you with fricking hell of a deal.
[00:49:23] Yeah, I love it. I think I think again, my mindset, we're talking about focusing our energy in a way
[00:49:31] that is actually going to help us continue in our business despite whatever challenges are before.
[00:49:36] Because there's always challenges even and let's remember to everyone, low interest rate environment,
[00:49:42] the 3% days, that was not a lot of fun if you were working with buyers. It was a lot of fun if
[00:49:48] you had a lot of listings. But if you were working with buyers, oh my god, like, let's not forget that
[00:49:53] your buyers who got homes were thrilled. There's a lot of unhappy people though that didn't get what
[00:50:00] they wanted or who paid, you know, X amount over what they probably should have because that was
[00:50:05] the condition. So I'm so glad the days of multiple offers are like almost over like that stuff was,
[00:50:10] that was stressful. Yeah, yeah. So so that I love that. I love that you said all this because
[00:50:17] that just reminded me that yes, things are different now, but not necessarily worse or better,
[00:50:24] just different. And so within different, you have to be chameleon this. Yeah. Yeah, to be a chameleon,
[00:50:29] that's in real estate. Real estate is moving, whether it's a down market, not market, a middle market,
[00:50:37] there's stuff being transacted. So just be able to kind of take the edge and the flows,
[00:50:43] you know, don't get, don't get pulled into the weeds. Well, I think this is a great place to wrap up
[00:50:49] because for anyone listening who thinks, gosh, you know, I would like to have a connection maybe
[00:50:55] down in the Miami area or, you know, somebody that I could possibly refer business to as well in
[00:51:00] the future because of course, lots of people retire or move to Florida or by second, third, you
[00:51:05] know, plus properties. You know, you obviously deal with people with multiple, multiple properties.
[00:51:11] And, you know, you're looking for to build those relationships so that when you do have those
[00:51:15] opportunities, and by the way, I've been finds those opportunities on the flip side too, where
[00:51:19] those people who are buying an eight million dollar home, probably not their only home, they
[00:51:23] probably have other properties. He's going to probably need to refer those people out in case
[00:51:27] they're moving somewhere where they don't know an agent. So this is a great reciprocal relationship
[00:51:31] possibly. So even everyone out there, if you're like, well, you know, gosh, I don't know if I'd be
[00:51:36] of any value, you know, think about it. And if you think you could provide value to Ivan or vice
[00:51:41] first, so you know, reach out and say, hey, I'd love to be part of your network. And here's why.
[00:51:45] And here's what I do. That's how relationships get started and founded. So, and by the way, too, for
[00:51:51] anyone out there who's a buyer, seller, investor, renter, who is looking to find a property or
[00:51:56] sell a property in the Miami area, you know, Ivan and Mike are the guys. So Ivan and Mike.com,
[00:52:02] they're going to take awesome care of you. I mean, the amount of transactions you guys, or sorry,
[00:52:07] the production level that you did last year, I was trying to think because I don't have our
[00:52:12] Chicago numbers pulled up for the entire, the entire area. But I would say that would put you as
[00:52:17] one of the, if not the top team, maybe one, two or three out of 47,000 agents. So Ivan and Mike are
[00:52:24] big, big producers. And they are very, very, very good at what they do. So you should consider
[00:52:30] working with them, whether you're an agent, you know, or whether you're somebody looking to work
[00:52:34] with a REALTOR by sell rent, invest, et cetera, those guys, these guys are the best. So everyone,
[00:52:39] go out and visit Ivan and Mike.com. Also follow them on Instagram, which is Miami luxury
[00:52:47] sales. Sorry, no, it isn't. Sorry about that. Only Miami luxury. Sorry about that. Only Miami
[00:52:54] luxury on Instagram. By the way, guys, don't have to worry about that. There's a link to it in our
[00:52:58] show now. Let's just click on it, subscribe and follow them. Mike, it's like, Ivan, your partner's
[00:53:04] Mike. We like Mike too. He's cool. He's all right. I guess when I, when I expect to talk to an
[00:53:10] Ivan, and this is like probably something that isn't politically correct, but I expect like a
[00:53:14] thick heavy accent from like an Eastern European accent, which you do not have.
[00:53:19] That's the idea. That's the idea. No, I'm talking to Ivan. No, Ivan, it was, it was a pleasure.
[00:53:25] By the way, just like you asked, where are you from in Connecticut? A little town called Madison,
[00:53:31] it's 20 minutes east of New Haven on the shoreline. So is that near old line?
[00:53:37] It's very close. It's about 20, 25 minutes from old line. Old line, you just keep going a little
[00:53:41] bit further, like 10 more exits, off of 95. I've been to old line. That's probably the closest I've
[00:53:47] been. But anyway, all right. On behalf of our audience, guys, we all need to thank Ivan for coming
[00:53:53] on our show, talking about how he built his business. We're so grateful that he spent an hour with
[00:53:58] us. So on behalf of everyone, Ivan, we say thanks. And if I called you, Mike, at any other time,
[00:54:04] during this, I think I'm now thinking just once. I did do once. Okay, sorry about that.
[00:54:09] My, my, my apologize. It's a tough day. But on behalf of Ivan and myself, we want to say thank you
[00:54:17] to the audience for making it all the way through. Guys, get in touch with Ivan. You know, reach out
[00:54:22] to him. See if you can. Thanks, I, and we're so grateful. We just ask one thing of everyone who
[00:54:28] listens is just how one friend about the show, one other REALTOR that might be struggling right now.
[00:54:34] That's worried about this year. That's stressed. A lot of agents are sending them a link to this
[00:54:38] episode. This is going to turn their day around and hopefully provide them a little bit of, a,
[00:54:43] little bit of a kindness and, and, you know, strategy for how to move through the year. So tell
[00:54:47] a friend, send them over to our website, keeping it real pod.com. Every episode can be streamed through
[00:54:52] a browser or if they're podcast listeners, just pull up, do a search for keeping it real. Hit that
[00:54:56] subscribe button. We appreciate it. All right. I've been, it was a real pleasure. And next time I'll
[00:55:01] have Mike on the show because I won't screw up the name. Perfect. Did you got a call in my,
[00:55:06] that's true. That, that, that all, yeah. Maybe he's got a thick accent that I'll get confused
[00:55:10] to get. Anyway, it was a pleasure. Thanks so much. We, we, we will see everybody on the next episode.
[00:55:16] Awesome.

Ivan, I'm so happy to have you on the show. Welcome. Hey, man. Thanks so much for having me. That was like the warmest, toastiest welcome. I like my glowing over here. That's why I was making you laugh in the background all the time. Yeah, I know it is. People do it all the time. Because it can be, you know, it's like not always something that people are used to hearing is all their credits kind of at once. I know it would make me very uncomfortable if someone were reading mine. So I definitely, I definitely understand the urge to sort of have fun with it. And also it was just that just your personality. I think that's great. Yeah, let's, so I always love to start at the beginning of the story. So I'm curious of how you got into, well, first of all, you just got into real estate. So I know you started as a sales rep for a developer, but how did you, how did that come about? So I actually, I moved to Miami in 2005. I had been in LA for four and a half years. And I was, you know, kind of doing odd jobs in Miami to fill up the time and also, you know, make a little bit of money. I was also, I was bartending for a staffing company. And one of the assignments was to bartend at the launch party for a new development called, called Canyon Ranch in Miami Beach. So, you know, so I'm bartending this party and it's a launch and it's just glamorous and like, just great looking people dressed in the nines. Sure. And I'm like, I'm like, this is cool. I'm like, this is cool. All these people are cool. And they're having, they're having an awesome time. I'm like, I'm like, this is, this is what I think I need to do. Yeah. And I'd already been working on my license because I was like, all right. And maybe I'll, you know, use some of my money to invest. I was like, talking to my buddy and saying, Peter's bird. Yeah. Well, it's like, it's like every third person in Florida has a license, you might as well get one anyway. Yeah, right. Might as well. Might as old jump in. And so while I was there, I spoke to the broker who was like just the coolest dude, he had like, you know, the frosted blonde tips were, which were back really, they were really in back then. Sure. I mean, I even had them like a few years before that. Sure. I can't judge. But I was like, you know, so I just told him I was like, I want to hang my license for you. I want to work on new, on new construction. I'm like, what's it going to take? He's like, well, you know, how many people in your database? I'm like, what's a database? And he's like, how much experience do you have in sales? And I'm like, well, I was a personal trainer. My ex-old membership sales. That's sales? Yeah, that's sales. It was something. And anyway, you know, you like me. I was obviously, you know, somewhat personable. And he said, listen, you know, come, come meet with my office manager and we'll figure something out. So I went met with the office manager. They, you know, they let me be a sales associate on, you know, in their brokerage, which, you know, basically didn't cost them anything. I just was there. Sure. And I just made a point of like going in every day to the office, going to every sales meeting, you know, which were often held at these new construction projects. And constantly asking like, when was there going to be a project for me? I was like, you know, I was like, if you've saw, if you've seen Shroff Shank redemption, just talk about like, I'm sending the letters to get the library. Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they finally just gave in. Well, that was like, me, I was like, when am I going to get a project? When am I going to get a project? So I ended up getting getting on a project in Miami Beach, which was like, it was not the most high end project that they had, but it was kind of like, all right, we'll try you out here. And I was put on it with two very seasoned agents. And I quickly outsold them and I was the, I was a star sales agent on that team. Wow. What a, what a, what a, that's an amazing story. Because number one, you were, you know, approached somebody at an event where, you know, you were the hired help. And then also, of course, working on your license at the same time, but just having the confidence to say to a, you know, to someone there, like, I want to work with you. In some ways, I think that's like every employer's like fantasy situation where somebody's like that motivated, where even in a scenario where it's not a real estate, specific sort of meeting for you and him, you're still having the confidence to go like, I want this. And I, and so it's, I'd love to say like, oh, I'm surprised that they would take a chance on you because of not having that particular background. But now that I think about it, it actually makes perfect sense because it wasn't a time where they would expect for somebody to come up who isn't yet in the industry and be like, I want to work with you. I wonder how much of that just played in, you know. Yeah. I mean, then, you know, and even now, you know, years later, 17 years later, and you know, having this great team and everything, agents are constantly approaching us to come sure with us. I mean, and, you know, we just brought on a guy a couple of months ago. He was on me for a year to join the team. And I was like, no, sorry, wrong time. We're not looking for anybody. He was relentless. And I finally was like, Mike, I'm like, I got to give this guy a shot. I'm like, I like this guy. He was an athlete. He keeps, keeps checking in with me. He wants to take me out for coffee. I'm like, I'm like, we need this kind of tenacity in the work, you know, in the agent side of things. And that's a quote I repeat to my team all the time is how you do anything is how you do everything. So we know that that will correlate to how they will be as an agent. I was trying to think I know a bunch of college athletes that have become REALTORS. I mean, some of them I've had on the show who are now top of the mountain REALTORS. But even just people who are newer to the industry who have that background where they played some some level of college sports, they always succeed at in real estate. And it's like I've yet to meet somebody who I know for sure played some sort of sport and then failed at real estate. I haven't met those, but I'm sure they exist. But boy, there's something about that discipline and that just hard work and tenacity where they're kind of like, yeah, I just going to I'm going to do the same effort I put into, you know, my sport into this. And I mean, you know, as well as I do, anyone who puts that kind of commitment in is guaranteed almost guaranteed to be successful. Yeah, no, totally. That's that spot on. And even, you know, just having a tolerance for discomfort, you know, whether that whether that's just being in like uncomfortable positions, you know, just like having to grind and, you know, like, and sometimes do things that you don't want to do. Like all that stuff just, you know, keeps building character and that ends up like, you know, being the building blocks for, you know, like, at least for me, those were the building blocks, building blocks of my success. Yeah, I mean, mine too, this idea of of learning how to tolerate discomfort. I mean, it's like, you're a personal trainer. I just actually came from the personal trainer just for this. And it's all about, it's all your advice. No, I won't. But I'm too, too, me just embarrassed to do that. But, but it is, it is wild because I'm almost three years in. And I never had that level of commitment to working out. I just didn't my whole life. And so, I'm like, I got to get a trainer. And I will tell you that it's no, it's still not fun because it's pain. I mean, it's painful. But it is, it is, it is, it is looked at me how to tolerate discomfort physically. That physical discomfort of like, this is going to be painful. And there's a huge benefit to doing it. And if I can just go, well, the benefit is going to outweigh whatever the short term pain is. And that's, it doesn't mean everyone needs to start like lifting heavy weights. But the idea of getting comfortable with whatever, with a physical discomfort or a mental discomfort or whatever it is, is so critical for being successful because this is a business that really can knock you down pretty fast and, and pretty hard. I mean, all it takes is, you know, you, you find out your best friend went with a different REALTOR or, or, you know, you just, you lose a deal for whatever reason. It's not your fault. It's easy. It's easy. And we all do. We all do. There's all kinds of, all kinds of roadblocks, you know, near, near big deals that just didn't happen. And, and it, you know, it's, it's really tough at the time, especially when you, you haven't kind of crossed over that, that kind of luxury or that level of success. And you're just trying to find your way to climb through and you miss those deals and it's tough. But it does build character. And, and that's a, you know, that's the stuff I lean on now in my success. Yeah, it's, I think resiliency is just like the name of the game with this one. It's just, you're going to get knocked down constantly. And, and just this idea of like, it's all going to work out. I'm just going to keep at it. And, and it, it usually, usually is a lot of that. It's just sort of there. It's as you know. So, so I'm probably speaking for the audience here because, and they, I think they understand the, that your story starts with, with you sort of having this, this opportunity in a sense that you jumped on when you were not, not in the industry at that moment. But for anyone that is in the industry right now, and I think, I think I don't have an idea of what you're going to say, but I don't want to say it for you because I might be wrong. But I'm curious. And if anyone listening is going, I want to be, to be chosen to be, to, you know, work some any any kind of developer does. Maybe it's luxury. Maybe it isn't. But I would like to be chosen to represent a developer in some of these transactions. I know here in Chicago, that is like, you know, it is, and there's pros and cons to being chosen too. I know it's not all wine and roses. But it is certainly something that people aspire to at least the option of being chosen. So I'm curious what you would suggest to somebody who wants to start taking steps to get the eye of developers. You know, there is a little bit of a difference from when I started in, you know, basically 2006 to now, you know, when I got into the business, there were there were agents that literally did nothing but work on developments. Sure. You know, like, and I had a friend who worked on a project with me and he basically said it this way, you have, you have house cats and you have street cats. And he's like, he's like, I'm a house cat. He's like, I'm never going to be a street cat street cat. And, and obviously, I was a house cat at the time. Now I'm a street cat. But, you know, so it's like, you know, they were two very distinct groups. Now we've got these indoor outdoor cats. And we find that, you know, I find that a lot of the best developers, the top developments, they want seasoned agents that are actually out there in the street, you know, mixing and mingling with top clients, you know, from here and around the world. And also, you know, socializing with all the other top agents so that they can mix with those agents and have those agents bring their clients in. So it's an even more coveted and harder spot to get. But I would say to, I would say two ways. One, find like an entry entry level kind of project. It might even be, you know, working for like culture homes. You know, you have some sales experience. You got your license like, you're willing to sell way out in the burbs and just like, you know, like selling, just a box of homes, you know, or or or or some kind of real estate. That would be kind of like one way and then you just work your way up. Be sure the absolute best in every one of those situations. And you'll plot, you'll plot your own course. The other one is, you know, is the team route. And I would say get yourself on a team, you know, because I say the three keys to mastery are the immersion, modeling and repetition. So if you're in the team and you're now immersing, immersing yourself and there should be other stuff with that, but you're doing that. You've got the leaders, the other people on the team, you know, you're modeling after and then you just keep repeating, repeating, repeating. Then that's going to build the backbone of kind of the substance that developers are going to look for. And then you'll start having some of the, you know, the sales experience, you'll start having some of the, you'll know some of the talk, you can talk the talk. And I think you'll have put together a database and all those kind of variables that developers look for. And you might get a little bit of a leg up and be able to skip over culture homes and go right into working a lower Miami project. Yeah, that makes that really makes perfect sense. Yeah, I think I agree with all of that. And I also think too, like I don't want to minimize how hard it is for you to do that even today because it's not like once you're in, you're in because you have to perform and deliver every single time and the stakes are really high for you because there's a line of agents, gosh, a mile long that would love to take your spot on some of those development deals. And you're in an ultra competitive market. In fact, you could argue Miami might be the number one real estate market in the world or in the country as far as was amount of dollars that sort of exchange hands. And the most resilient too, I must say. Yeah, well, it is, it is, yeah, it's like this time of year, I always think, Florida's, there's a lot of benefits to tax. There's a lot going for Miami. Miami is just transforming so rapidly, just getting better and better. Yeah, I was there about two years ago, I hadn't been to Miami in that time and was staying in Don on South Beach and just love what's been done down there. So that's, I think that's really helpful advice. It's all the same things that I think we've heard from other agents on the show, but I don't think that means it's, repetition, as you said, one of the three components, it's the mother of skill. It's doing the same thing. That's the mother of mastery. Yeah, it is, I think. It is. So this idea of just putting the blinders on and going for it and developing skills, I think it's you're right. When you play at that level, the skill is really, really important. And skills can be honed in sharpened, right? So it's this idea of just working at it. Let's talk about the relationships, because you have a really, when you work with developers, that's a really difficult thing, because you're serving many masters, really. You're obviously keeping the developers happy, trying to sell at the rate that they want, with the pricing that they want, also dealing with other REALTORS, dealing with buyers, and all sorts of factors. So I know there's, it does not mean that it's an easy job at all working on developments or with developers. But I'm curious on, sort of, as your team has continued to grow, where do you find the most joy? Do you like working with the developers, with the public, with both? Curious on what's like your favorite thing? Yeah, I mean, as I said, I was a house cat, and then I moved out onto the street, and I'm actually happier being a street cat. I like being out there in the world, I like mixing and mingling, and I don't like being kind of just like to, not always like stuff, but just like, you know, just to focus on one project, because, you know, Miami is so dynamic and so versatile, and there's so many great real estate opportunities that I love selling everything. So, you know, right now, what I prefer to do, I want to work with, I want to work with people, I just love working with great people. When I first started in membership sales, for a gym, it was a different kind of sales. It was like using techniques, choosing techniques, and I remember the first time I used a closing technique, to close somebody, and they bought a membership, and then I realized that they weren't coming in, and that I basically sold them, like, I didn't like it, I didn't feel good about it. What I do now is relationships house. Like, first I'm selling me, like, do you want to work with me? Like, here's all the reasons why, because I'm going to be a trusted resource, I'm a property matchmaker, I'm going to put you with the most amazing property. But, you know, I want to become their friend, I want to, I mean, because I truly deeply care about them, and that's what gives me the satisfaction, because I know, in the end, I've helped put them in their family in a place where they're just, they're going to have the best lifestyle, like, the best lifestyle that's going to match their needs. So, so that's what really, like, you know, turns my crank, so to speak. Yeah, that's your why. You like, you like, giving, there's a lot of satisfaction in that. And so, I'm curious, because you're talking about wanting to become, you know, friends and develop these sort of intimate relationships with clients, and really deep and continue to deepen them so that, you know, they continue to, you know, obviously, be part of your life. I'm curious, I'm always curious on what, what are you doing, or what do you recommend doing in between sales with a client, so that, you know, you just sold somebody a home, they moved in, it's their dream home, it might be their forever home, or, or at least their for a while home. What are you doing so that to make sure that they don't forget about one year, two years, three years, and just, I always think, you know, this is a huge opportunity, and probably something that a lot of agents struggle with. It's like, okay, transaction over, I know I should stay in touch. I'm not exactly sure how often and what, and what to do. Yeah, great point. That's, I think that's vital, because, you know, you know, you don't want to be a one-pump chump. Not only do you want that repeat business, but you want them to tell their, you know, their friends and their family, and you want, and you just, I don't know for me, I just, I want to know how they're doing down the road. So, I think it's, you know, hard systems, like, you gotta have systems in place. That's, you know, your CRM, you gotta have your CRM working. For me, delegating, when I started really delegating and spending money on delegating, that was, that was hugely transformative, you know, having assistance helping you do stuff, and they help us with follow-up in a major way, whether it's emails, text messages, sending gift, sending letters. So, that's kind of the whole kick and kaboodles that, like, you know, we're sending them gifts on their birthday, we're sending them cards, we're calling them, we're checking in, you know, every, every couple of weeks, you know, it's just saying hello, you know, how are they enjoying their place? Did they hear about this thing that's going on? We sent them articles, oh, the top 10 restaurants in Miami, we texted it over to them where we have our assistance text over in the home. So, we're, we're just, you know, constantly trying to be, I was saying, we're trying to be like an eternal resource as well. That is such a, you know, it's so funny, this top 10, this top restaurants thing, it sounds so simple, and yet in all of the interviews I've had over all of the years, I don't think anyone specifically gave that particular tip, and I just realized, as you were saying it, what a brilliant tip it is, because you can just make it neighborhood specific to wherever they, they live, and this is really an endless amount of content. I mean, you could say, you could do restaurant of the week, or you could do top three restaurants, or whatever you want to do it, but that is such an easy way to create content that's actually valuable to the people that live in those communities, and in a way that's not, hey, I'm looking for another sale, or, you know, send me the names of some of your friends, which of course, I'm not criticizing people who do it that way either, it's not my particular approach, but I understand that some people do. For people that are like, I don't want to bug, bug, I don't really want to bother people, it's like, well then send them things of value, and that is a great example, totally. And you can do it with your sphere of influence, you could, I mean, it's not that much work, but it's not. I would love it if every week I received an email in the neighborhood I live, which is Wicker Park, and which has got hundreds of restaurants, I mean, we just have so many restaurants, and it can be overwhelming, and I live in the middle of it, and I'm like, God, I would love for somebody to be like, this is the place you should go this week. And I mean, I really would. And you get that on a Friday, you're like, oh, I'm going to go out tonight or tomorrow night. It's like, oh, top 10, like, this place, let's see, oh, that's the food I want, boom. I know it's, it sounds silly, but it is like, again, that's, and I'm, guys, I'm not a practicing agent, I'm licensed, but I don't practice. So like, I am somebody who is, might be in your database, I'm like a person that is like in your database, there's a lot of people like me, they want to know, you know, and they don't always necessarily, you know, I think people who own homes are always interested in one of my homes worth, but aside from that, I think most, a lot of the communication can just be like, hey, how's it going? What are you up to? What are you? And I imagine you do a lot of that. Totally, yeah, all the time. I mean, I'm, I, I, I gorge, I gorge on all things my image, like I'm just, you know, you can tell, I light up when I talk about the city. It's, the city is my second love, you know, so I love sharing things about the city. And when I learn about, you know, oh, this, this new rooftop restaurant is coming to Copenhagen Grove, you know, I'm like, taking the link and I'm texting and out to all my clients who bought and coconut grove, you know, like, yeah. And, and it's just a, it's really like a natural thing for me. And, and, and it obviously it perpetuates the relationship, you know, for, for years to come. Let's, let's, I want to talk about delegating because you mentioned that that was really a game changer for you when you started investing in hiring, you know, or just getting, getting some of the things off your plate that maybe weren't the things you really preferred to do or maybe they weren't business building things, but things that needed to get done. So I'm curious on, on, you know, for there's a lot of people out there listening who are going, I would love to delegate some of my work. How do you figure out what you want to delegate and what you want to keep for yourself? Mm-hmm. Uh, I think it's pretty easy. What do you, what do you tend to procrastinate on? What do you, what do you avoid doing? Delicate that shit. Don't do it. I mean, you know, Mike and I joined, joined partners, we've gained partners and, and, you know, the first year is like, you're not closing like crazy amounts of deals and, you know, money is a little bit tighter and it's like, you know, we were at that point where we were kind of like overflowing, you know, like trying to be jacks of all trades, writing contracts, doing follow-up, writing listings, like chasing our commissions. I mean, it was fucking hard. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sure. No, you can swear. It was hard. It was hard and overwhelming. And in it took away from my ability to perform at what I'm best at, which is working with people and closing deals. Like, I love working with people. I love selling the best of the best real estate in Miami. I love going to the projects, you know, talking to the agents, talking to the developers. I don't love working on contracts. I don't love the minutiae of like, you know, the, of, um, you know, scheduling the inspections and being there at the inspection, like, I don't want to do that stuff. So once, once I realized that for myself, Mike and I had a good conversation. He was on board and we said, like, let's spend some money and hire somebody to do this shit. And let me tell you, that's a game changer. Yeah. If you have not hired somebody to take the load off of you and stuff you don't like doing or don't have the time to go on hire somebody. Start with, start with a, a virtual admin. If you, you know, if you don't have the budget to go full time somebody, you know, in person, get a virtual admin, like it will be a huge game changer for people. And, and, and, and really affordable. I mean, you can, you know, depending on the skill level, I mean, you can find people as low as, you know, I don't know, $5 an hour, maybe even less. Now, obviously, it's not, it's not so much about wanting to spend the least amount of money. But if that's your budget, you can find people that'll do it. And, and so, you know, places like Upwork.com are great resources where you can go post and add people from all over the world will vie for your business. And, you know, you'll have to figure out, you know, who you want to hire. But, um, but yeah, I, that's a great option. So for anyone out there that's like, I can't afford to have, you know, a full-time assistant. Maybe you can afford not to. Yeah. Well, you're not too. I'm telling you, game changer. And, and we should also honor the fact that probably when you guys were ready to make that financial commitment initially, was added uncomfortable moment, like, oh my gosh, was it a time where you were like, I'm, oh, it was, it wasn't. It was easy for you. No, no, no, it was totally, it was hard to start spending like our own money that we were getting. And like, you know, as a real estate agent, you're like, you never really know exactly when the next piece comment, or maybe know when the next one is, but not the one after that. And so that's, that's, that's uncomfortable. And brutal. But it's, it's, it's necessary, man. So, yeah, it's, it's, again, it's this idea of betting on yourself and going like, no, this will work out. It might be uncomfortable for a while, because I'm spending money. And yeah, there's going to be times of like, I got to train and build systems and all of those things. Yes. So you just got to push through that discomfort and realize like, oh, top agents aren't doing everything. They're just doing what they are, what they love and what they're best at and what's, what's, what's on their own activities. Yeah. 100% so, back to relationships for a moment. So, you know, you, you just gave a lot of great examples of providing value, you know, in between transactions, you know, staying in touch with clients, giving them something that they can use on a regular basis, making sure they don't feel neglected, you know, whether it's just reaching out and how's it going, you know, saw you on vacation, tell me about it kind of thing versus, you know, hey, here's like some cool real estate info or here's some, you know, community info. How important is it to be really immersed in the community first? So we all know real estate is usually hyper local for most agents work, you know, locally. How important is it to be known in the community and not so much to be like a public figure, but just somebody that's in the community and supportive of the community? I imagine you guys are, for sure. Yeah. I mean, you know, I guess this is too full to, to, to, to, to, to, to, to, know agents that have picked up and left one market, ploughed themselves into another market, and found, found it immediate success, you know, so there are ways to do that and they clearly were not immersed in, you know, the, in the world, so to speak, of that city yet. It's, it's, it's, it's all the things Miami and I mean, and, and in volunteering, you know, like, as you mentioned, like I'm a big brother, in big brothers, big sisters, we also, we do a lot of donations to some of the, you know, the various big charities in Miami. Lotus House is one that we, we did it, we, you know, we got a table for, we invited people, we mixed and mingle. So, you know, it's good for people to see that, you know, it's, we're not just about the money, you know, we're also about the community, and, and we get out and about and we go to the chamber, we're now and again, and, and all that stuff. I, you know, I think it's important. It also, you know, it also kind of depends on who your, your client faces, you know, for people that, you know, like, if someone on my team was, you know, focused on getting single-family home listings in ex-community, I'd be like, you need to start living in that community, you know, like, need to start, you need to start going to, you know, the, the weekly moms events or, or you need to, like, start getting plugged into the schools and go into the art fair, like, you got to start digging yourself into that. And, and, you know, like Mike and I, we deal with mostly, I would say, Northeasterners is a big, is a big portion of our clientele, Northeasterners, people, people from Chicago, California, a lot, a lot of tax flights, some, some Canadians, some, some Europeans, some South Americans. We, we actually, him and I specifically don't have a huge amount of, like, local clients. So, you know, for us, it's almost more important for us to be out and about in the world, you know, so, so we're traveling to Europe in the summer, you know, trying to go to the Hamptons or, you know, going into New York City a lot. I'm kidding. Well, that makes sense. I'm from Connecticut. So, so that's, that's, that's kind of how we kind of get out in the, the bigger community so speak. That's so interesting. So, you travel to where the potential customers are and, uh, where they are today and, and where they might be, obviously, in the future is, is, is Miami. That, probably that makes perfect sense. I've yet to hear anybody talk about that specifically, about leaving geographically so that you can get in front of potential buyers or, yeah, I mean, I mean, I had a, I had a prospect that I'd been in touch with over the phone only and he was from Atlanta. The Compass ended up having the Compass retreat in Atlanta. So, I looked them up and I said, hey, what are you doing? I'd love to, you know, take out for coffee. He said, no, come over my house. So, he invited me over his house, just freaking giant mansion in like one of the most, you know, wealthy areas of Atlanta. And we just, I totally hit it off and him and brought his wife over. They started pouring me whiskey. I was like, oh my god. So, you know, but it was great because like, you know, I, I know as soon as they come to Miami, we're going out and I've cemented that relationship. And in the same vein, I'm love to hear your perspective of the importance of building strong relationships with other REALTORS, whether they're in your local market and the people you, you know, will be on, you know, maybe one side of a deal with against the other, working together to close it or even REALTORS from other markets who might be referring clients in. How critical is it for you to have strong relationships with other agents? Yeah, I mean, it's, it's super critical, I think really for every agent, you know, I know some agents that 75% of their business is referrals from other agents. That's not us, but it's actually something we're working on growing. We actually have, you know, we've kind of put the structure in place to really work on growing our referral network. We're looking for great partners out there. But, but you know, that's why we went to, why we went to Atlanta. Jessica paid us who runs our team. She's going to Boston this weekend to meet with agents. She was in the York meet with agents. Mike was in the York meet with agents. Hate our Michael on our team was meeting with agents in New York. So this is really like a big initiative of ours to get out there and meet lots of agents from the various feeder markets, you know, around the country, but, you know, really even around the world because Toronto, London, you know, there's, there's other feeder markets. But even, even just, you know, within Miami, you know, it's very, it's very important, I think, to, to be well-liked, you know, to be thought of as somebody who's, um, likable and, and easy to work with, you know, because I know from like my side when, when I'm going to show listings and I'm like looking at who the, who the agents are, like, there are some occasionally going to be an agent where I go, ooh, like, and you never want to be on that end of it. You don't want to be on that end where somebody looks at your name. I don't want to be as bad. No. Like, I'm like this, yeah, this person, you know, they do this, they do that, like, you know, X tried to steal my client one. Yeah, there are a problem. Or they're just, they just don't, they just don't shut up. They just talk, talk, talk, talk to clients like, overwhelm. I'm like, there's, there's a few of them out there and, my advice is don't be that person. I, there's a, there's a way Adam Corolla used to talk about, he goes, you never want to be, it was like a life advice thing and he was saying, you never want to be the guy that when your name comes up on the caller ID to someone else, they go, oh, God. And that is a good point. Yeah. I mean, like, I get calls from other agents that just asking for like, help, like, hey, I saw you close this unit in this building. I have a client who's thinking about buying the same unit two floors up. Can you give me some insight? And I'm like, absolutely, like, I want to be helpful because, you know, when the shoe is on the other foot, maybe I'll need them. And, and, and not the vast majority of agents, not saying the vast majority. A lot of agents can't be bothered, you know, they even, a lot of them have just, just bad etiquette, they don't answer the phone. I'm like, Miami, for, for, for, as glamorous and wealthiest city as it is, I really don't think it's the hardest city to become successful in because you just have to do this much more to set yourself above the people that are doing the bare minimum. You know, I agree. And you just said something very powerful. And I want to make kind of like, step on a little bit because it's so, you just said something actually quite, quite brilliant, I think, which was if you are selling this, particularly applies to condo sales, you know, this idea that if you're about to list a condo in a building that you haven't listed in before, take a look at the closed listings and not just for the data, but actually go, hey, maybe I'll reach out to a couple of agents that just closed the deal here and just be like, hey, is there anything I need to know? I know you've had success in this building. I would, I'm sorry to bug you, but I'd really love to get any advice that you might have. And first of all, that's super flattering to get a call like that. It's super flattering. Like, I was, like, it just happened to me last week. And I was like, I was just like more than, kind of blown away that somebody thought to do that. I wasn't happy. Yeah, because I was like, oh, you know, like, this guy's like looking up to me and he's, you know, he's looking at me for help. And I was like, this is this, this is this. And I was completely transparent about the deal. And he was like, beyond thankful because like, he didn't know that the deal included the boat slip and what that equated to on a, on a, on a dollar level. So it was, it was great. Yeah, this, this idea of, I mean, it is, you know, I know you guys weren't on opposite ends of the transaction. But even when that happens, it's still a cooperative commission, right? It's still supposed to be cooperative. And so I think agents sometimes forget about that when it's, when it's just a random agent and at a different, you know, maybe they closed a deal a week before. And you're like, I don't want to bother them. They don't know me. I don't know them. It's, yeah. I think that's, and if they don't call you back, it's no big deal. But at least you made the effort. And again, I think that that idea of, you know, agents who are successful in my experience. And of course, there's exceptions to this. But almost all the time that I've dealt with agents who are, or top producers, they tend to be super generous and super friendly. And they get it. Everyone's got to start somewhere. They remember what it was like. And it's appreciative when, when, when, when when somebody calls them and says, Hey, I'd love to get some advice. Totally. I, I, besides all this other stuff. And, you know, um, seeing this, seeing my clients happy, like the other thing, I get tremendous satisfaction out of helping other people. And like helping other people to avoid some of the pitfalls and hurdles that I had to go through. And, and I'll say to my team members, like, if, if, if you're experienced on my team, through my, your experience on my team, if you don't end up being becoming a better person, then you were when you got here, then I'm, then I failed. You know, so like, I really, you know, hold myself up to, to, to make, to be a contribution to everybody and to, you know, make sure that they leave a better person, a better professional than when they got here. I wonder how many of our listeners right now having just heard you say that are thinking, I would love it if my team lead or my managing broker or whoever is, is sort of in charge of me as an agent said, I want everybody here to become a better human being. And my job is to help you become a better human being, not just become successful at real estate. I want to help, you know, that is, that is a really powerful thing that you said. And I want to honor that because I don't know that every team leader managing broker has that same philosophy. It's, it's certainly a, tremendous responsibility that you're taking on. And one that you take very seriously. And so I think it's a great place to mention that if somebody is, is a REALTOR in the Miami, sort of, Miami data area and, and you're looking to maybe see what other options exist. And you think you might be a fit for the Ivan and Mike team. And again, remember, it might take some time because these guys want to see a level of commitment and dedication, but you got to start someone. If, if somebody was wanting to consider working on your team with your team, providing some value to your team, tell me like, what are you looking for in an agent and, and how could they get in touch with you? Yeah. Well, I mean, we're not looking for green agents, you know, green as an, an experience that doesn't mean it's an absolute no. Nothing is ever an absolute no. You know, this last gentleman we brought on, he was green. And that's why it was, it was a no for now, which is also, you know, people should be taking notes as far as sales go. No is only no for now. But it wasn't no at the time. It became it became a yes because he was tenacious enough. But right right out of the gates, we're looking for people that are a little bit more seasoned, you know, listing specialists, you know, somebody that can go out there and get single family home listings that can go out there and, you know, kind of kill their own prey. Not just that they're not just going to sit back and wait for us to be out. Just feeding off of feeding off of. Yeah. That's that we're not looking for that, you know, but we're looking for people that that want to be part of a team and want to be part of a special team. A team that's more about that's not just about the numbers and just about, you know, Gucci, Gucci belts and parties on, you know, on South Beach on Friday, like we really, we're about personal development, we're about giving back to our community and we really, you know, feel like like we're a family, you know, so if you're if you're about that jam, cool. If that's not your jam, that's cool too. Just we're not the fit for you. Like I know, I think that's very fair and people they want to, if anyone out there wants to reach out to the Ivan and Mike team, you can go to Ivan and Mike.com. We'll have a link to that in the show notes or hit them up on Instagram or Facebook. On Instagram, they're only my Emmy luxury. I have one last question for you because and it's kind of a funny thing. I get a little nervous asking it because I'm always afraid somebody's going to chastise me for for bringing up something that might be a bit negative. No, no, no, it's I think it's realistic and I'm just curious to get your takes. I think 2023 is going to be a really tough year for agents. I don't I don't think I'm going on a limb by saying that. I think, but there's some people that just like to see the positive side of everything and they're like, it's going to be fine. We have almost that's good. No, that's good because I want to hear that perspective because for me, we have about 800 agents here at our company and I'm terrified because I'm like, oh my God, rates are up in Ventories down. This is going to be tough. What are you doing to stay positive and also stay productive despite the fact that there are definitely challenges right now that maybe exist a couple of years ago. Okay, so where attention goes, energy flows, right? So if you're constantly focused on the sensationalism that's out there about, you know, sorry, housing bubble, bubble bubble, bubble bubble collapse, you know, the housing market is bubble is this and I'm like, you know what, it's noise. It's just noise. I'm always reading between the lines. I'm looking at the market. I'm I got my boots on the ground here in Miami. We're very low in Ventories. So you know what I'm like, I'm focused on the fact that like I know what the reality is and I'm focused on the fact that there are still great opportunities out there. So I truly believe there are opportunities out there for people and I truly believe there are great great products out there for people to buy and that's why I just did 25 million this past weekend and three deals. Unbelievable. Three three deals. I was out of the country. I did 25 million. And I'm not trying to like say I'm like, you know, this, no, you're not you're not bragging. You're just reporting. You're just like I stay positive. I'm I listen, I get up in the morning. I listen to to meditation. I have affirmations like I am starting to stand in the garden. I'm standing in the garden at the gate of my mind. That's smart. And I just can't let the crap come in. That's just noise. Yeah, it's but but when you said something very important, you said, I know the reality. It's not like I'm I'm poly and I'm not paying attention. I don't actually know what's going on. I know I know what's going on, which is why I'm choosing to focus my energy in things that will actually help drive my business because you can't control inventory or rates, but you can find opportunity within within those things. But if you're right, if your mind is being entertained by information that isn't particularly helpful to actually creating a plan, then it becomes like just consumerism. I'm just taking an information and it's going to bum me out because of course it is. And it's not like you're not strong enough to push it away. It's just human nature. When you absorb things to sort of react to them. And so you know, you said something really important. It's like you can pay attention and you can not pay too much attention so that you're immobilized. Yeah, exactly. It's like, you know, you're not trying to be like a car salesman. Like nobody wants that. Like, you know, and you know, all of our all of our buyers are sophisticated, right? They're like, it's all fucking crap. You know, like there's there's some truth in that too. It's just like, you know, let me let me understand you and what what your needs are, what what fits your lifestyle. Let me present some options and then let me go to work and negotiate you with fricking hell of a deal. Yeah, I love it. I think I think again, my mindset, we're talking about focusing our energy in a way that is actually going to help us continue in our business despite whatever challenges are before. Because there's always challenges even and let's remember to everyone, low interest rate environment, the 3% days, that was not a lot of fun if you were working with buyers. It was a lot of fun if you had a lot of listings. But if you were working with buyers, oh my god, like, let's not forget that your buyers who got homes were thrilled. There's a lot of unhappy people though that didn't get what they wanted or who paid, you know, X amount over what they probably should have because that was the condition. So I'm so glad the days of multiple offers are like almost over like that stuff was, that was stressful. Yeah, yeah. So so that I love that. I love that you said all this because that just reminded me that yes, things are different now, but not necessarily worse or better, just different. And so within different, you have to be chameleon this. Yeah. Yeah, to be a chameleon, that's in real estate. Real estate is moving, whether it's a down market, not market, a middle market, there's stuff being transacted. So just be able to kind of take the edge and the flows, you know, don't get, don't get pulled into the weeds. Well, I think this is a great place to wrap up because for anyone listening who thinks, gosh, you know, I would like to have a connection maybe down in the Miami area or, you know, somebody that I could possibly refer business to as well in the future because of course, lots of people retire or move to Florida or by second, third, you know, plus properties. You know, you obviously deal with people with multiple, multiple properties. And, you know, you're looking for to build those relationships so that when you do have those opportunities, and by the way, I've been finds those opportunities on the flip side too, where those people who are buying an eight million dollar home, probably not their only home, they probably have other properties. He's going to probably need to refer those people out in case they're moving somewhere where they don't know an agent. So this is a great reciprocal relationship possibly. So even everyone out there, if you're like, well, you know, gosh, I don't know if I'd be of any value, you know, think about it. And if you think you could provide value to Ivan or vice first, so you know, reach out and say, hey, I'd love to be part of your network. And here's why. And here's what I do. That's how relationships get started and founded. So, and by the way, too, for anyone out there who's a buyer, seller, investor, renter, who is looking to find a property or sell a property in the Miami area, you know, Ivan and Mike are the guys. So Ivan and Mike.com, they're going to take awesome care of you. I mean, the amount of transactions you guys, or sorry, the production level that you did last year, I was trying to think because I don't have our Chicago numbers pulled up for the entire, the entire area. But I would say that would put you as one of the, if not the top team, maybe one, two or three out of 47,000 agents. So Ivan and Mike are big, big producers. And they are very, very, very good at what they do. So you should consider working with them, whether you're an agent, you know, or whether you're somebody looking to work with a REALTOR by sell rent, invest, et cetera, those guys, these guys are the best.

Mike, it's like, Ivan, your partner's Mike. We like Mike too. He's cool. He's all right. I guess when I, when I expect to talk to an Ivan, and this is like probably something that isn't politically correct, but I expect like a thick heavy accent from like an Eastern European accent, which you do not have. That's the idea. That's the idea. No, I'm talking to Ivan. No, Ivan, it was, it was a pleasure. By the way, just like you asked, where are you from in Connecticut? A little town called Madison, it's 20 minutes east of New Haven on the shoreline. So is that near old line? It's very close. It's about 20, 25 minutes from old line. Old line, you just keep going a little bit further, like 10 more exits, off of 95. I've been to old line. That's probably the closest I've been. But anyway, all right. On behalf of our audience, guys, we all need to thank Ivan for coming on our show, talking about how he built his business. We're so grateful that he spent an hour with us. So on behalf of everyone, Ivan, we say thanks. And if I called you, Mike, at any other time, during this, I think I'm now thinking just once. I did do once. Okay, sorry about that. My, my, my apologize. It's a tough day. But on behalf of Ivan and myself, we want to say thank you to the audience for making it all the way through. Guys, get in touch with Ivan. You know, reach out to him. See if you can. Thanks, I, and we're so grateful.
