[00:01:39] Today's episode is brought to you by Corded.io.
[00:01:43] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team?
[00:01:47] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:51] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:54] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:56] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool
[00:01:59] powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:02:04] are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm
[00:02:10] are also looking to leave you.
[00:02:12] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:02:17] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:20] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:26] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:29] Not only does it do that, but Corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:34] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:36] So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:40] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:44] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:46] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:50] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, Corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:55] Visit Corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:58] That's Corded.io and now, onto the show.
[00:03:17] And notice what it is you feel.
[00:03:22] Notice what comes up for you as you listen in to what I'm about to describe.
[00:03:29] Imagine yourself on a call with a partner, an investor, a broker, a client, or even your spouse.
[00:03:39] They say something, small, casual, maybe even well intended.
[00:03:48] But the second it lands, your body tightens, your chest compresses,
[00:03:56] your jaw clenches, your tone sharpens.
[00:04:00] Suddenly, you feel as if you're on the defense explaining, justified or worse.
[00:04:08] You go silent.
[00:04:12] Emense resentment fills your system.
[00:04:15] You become passive aggressive, maybe outright aggressive.
[00:04:19] And within seconds, the conversation isn't about the deal or the original intention of the conversation.
[00:04:25] It's about you, your competence, your intelligence, your worth, your credibility.
[00:04:37] You replay the conversation for hours, sometimes days.
[00:04:42] You draft emails on your head that you never send.
[00:04:46] You mentally prosecute the other person like they're on trial.
[00:04:49] But here's the most painful part of this experience.
[00:04:55] When you continue to find yourself stuck on the offensive, constantly subject to one personal attack after the next, or should I say perceived personal attack, deals continue to slow.
[00:05:11] Trust erodes, relationships, fracture, team stop being honest, partner stop bringing you hard truths.
[00:05:22] And at home, both with your spouse and your kids.
[00:05:26] Well, you're distant, short, emotionally unavailable.
[00:05:32] All because something felt like an attack, even if it wasn't meant to be.
[00:05:40] Today's episode is about why that happens.
[00:05:43] And more importantly, how to diffuse the flood of negative harsh anger filled emotions that cost you your edge, energy and impact.
[00:05:57] Welcome back to another episode of the Keeping it Real Podcast.
[00:06:01] Once a month, I have the absolute honor to do a special guest episode called the inner game of real estate success.
[00:06:09] My name is Paul Salter.
[00:06:11] I'm a mindset and performance coach with over 16 years of experience, helping my clients get unstuck out of their own way to unlock their potential.
[00:06:22] I use hypnosis to help my clients unlearn and dismantle the destructive patterns of thinking, feeling, believing and behaving that keep them stuck in a pattern of two steps forward, three steps back.
[00:06:38] And once a month, typically the last Thursday of every month, though interestingly enough, this year, both Thanksgiving and Christmas have conflicted with those last Thursdays, hence the subtle change in date this episode in the past one.
[00:06:52] But once a month, last Thursday of the month, we're going live to dig into the deep level, emotionally charged, identity attached topics that are really holding you back.
[00:07:05] The origin of the limiting beliefs and sabotaging behaviors that typically occur beneath conscious awareness, holding you back for more confidence, happiness, impact and income.
[00:07:21] Every week, twice a week, if you love this content, this is the sixth, seventh, maybe even eighth episode, I've had the opportunity to join the keeping a real podcast for.
[00:07:31] But if you're liking what you're hearing, I do have my own podcast. It's called the scratch golfers mindset podcast.
[00:07:37] Here's a little secret. It's a personal development podcast. The sky is as a golf mindset podcast. You don't have to play golf or know anything about golf to listen in and find immense value from both myself and the wide array of expert guests I bring on every week. So if you're liking this, need another strong personal development podcast in your library, I recommend you check it out.
[00:08:01] Today, we're talking about your pattern of taking things personally, constantly feeling on edge, like you're under attack, which leads to you being reactive, rather than responsive, on the defensive, rather than diligently and patiently on the offensive.
[00:08:23] When you feel attacked, it's rarely about the present moment.
[00:08:32] It's typically because of one or more of these three things. Number one, your nervous system is wired for threat.
[00:08:44] Number two, there's an element of truth in the statement that was shared with you.
[00:08:52] Number three, there's an incongruency between who you say you are and how you're showing up.
[00:09:04] So let's begin to unpack these to bring some clarity and most importantly awareness as to why you are prone to react this way.
[00:09:14] In so many situations that don't warrant this offensive attack, this verbal assault that typically plays out after the fact that leaves you stuck feeling regret, sadness, ashamed, guilty, disappointed in yourself having to make amends apologize one time after the next.
[00:09:37] So let's talk about it. First and foremost, like I mentioned, if you're experiencing this feeling that you're always on attack, taking things personally, your nervous system is just locked into and stuck in fight or flight.
[00:09:52] Past experiences have taught you that criticism equals danger. Typically if you struggle to truly hear and accept criticism, there is a breadcrumb of past experiences that has highlighted for you or made you feel to believe that when you are criticized, you are not enough.
[00:10:15] And if you are not enough, you are not worthy, you are not deserving, maybe of love, maybe of belonging, maybe of connection, maybe of money, maybe you grew up needing to perform to be accepted, maybe you were only praised when you produced results.
[00:10:33] Maybe you learned early that mistakes had consequences and sometimes unfair, unjust consequences.
[00:10:40] And as a result, you got stuck in this perpetual pattern of being ashamed, dismissed or emotionally invalidated.
[00:10:47] So now every time you receive criticism or something that has perceived as criticism, it's an actual threat on your identity, your well-being.
[00:10:59] And your nervous system reacts well before logic gets involved.
[00:11:04] Number two, and this is a big one. Listen closely here.
[00:11:11] When you are consistently engaged in this pattern of taking things personally, one major reason this might exist is because there is truth in that statement.
[00:11:24] This one stings.
[00:11:27] Sometimes the reason you take things so personally, and that it hits so hard is because it's something you already deep down believe about yourself, believe to be true, yet you hate it and you work so hard to deny, repress or avoid ever connecting with the part of yourself you hate.
[00:11:48] Maybe it's around your lack of organization, your procrastination tendencies, you're over promising an under delivering pattern, you're not available as you say you are deals feel sloppy messy rushed come together the last minute.
[00:12:04] And I'm reminded of a funny story, I call it funny now, it wasn't funny in the moment.
[00:12:08] For the longest time, there was a prominent person in my life who drove me batshit crazy, I felt she was incredibly manipulative.
[00:12:20] Always finagling the system, having extra conversations between working parties to get things to land in her favor.
[00:12:28] Things would change the last second, things would we would do x, y, and z, but last minute they become a b and c, and it just felt like these manipulative tendencies were growing more pronounced the longer and more time I spent with this individual.
[00:12:45] It wasn't until a couple years later that this individual was no longer in my life that I opened my eyes and my heart to the root of awakening and truth of the matter.
[00:12:58] I too had those manipulative tendencies I too wanted things to fall in my favor work out to my advantage or be more convenient for me and how I was choosing to spend my time what was happening here and this is the key point I want you to take is that when a behavior or something that is said by another person triggers you.
[00:13:20] It's a mirror of a part of yourself you don't like have disowned or are trying to hide and this phenomenon is known as the holographic universe and it's a theory of the universe that proposes every small piece of a hologram contains the information of the entire image you break it apart and each fragment still holds the whole just express different.
[00:13:50] What does that mean? You are not only confident or only anxious or only disciplined your collection of multiple parts confident anxious patient selfish optimistic angry compassionate jealous loving all of these co exist within you different parts well they show up in different moments at different intensities every part is real every part is every part belongs.
[00:14:18] When someone's behavior sets you off or when a common is made about a part of you you have actively worked to dismiss repressor deny whether it be laziness anger neediness sloppiness it's often because you are hiding that part of you it is true you do have that part or those tendencies it may not be the trait that you lead with might not be the characteristic you're most proud of it may even be the trait that you tried hardest to deny or have.
[00:14:47] High but it is there and when the outside world activates it you react that to them but to the part of you that feels exposed in a quick sidebar a book I cannot recommend enough that further dives into this topic of your triggers are your teachers is called the dark side of the light chasers by Debbie Ford this book describes the phenomenon
[00:15:17] of the holotropic universe it introduces more depth and detail around shadow work and I can't recommend it enough it's something I recommend for the vast majority of my clients and it really it just paints the picture that other people are your mirrors and what triggers you can be your teacher if you choose to look inward with courage and curiosity to confront accept acknowledge and begin doing the work to let go and into green.
[00:15:44] Back on track here the third reason you are so prone to taking things personally is there's an incongruency between who you say you are and how you're showing up you know this is the quiet killer you see yourself as discipline reliable high integrity a strong leader but lately you're cutting corners you're avoiding hard converse you know you're not going to be the one who's in the middle of that.
[00:16:12] You're rushing decisions operating from fatigue not clarity this internal gap who you think you are and say you are versus who you're showing up as an acting as that gap creates doubt it also creates emotional fragility meaning you are more on edge and more prone to being reactive when you hear something that ruffles your feathers or confronts a part of you that you are not willing to own and exit.
[00:16:42] And when that doubt exists when that emotional fragility exists the littlest of comments can set you off because they feel like a massive threat to your integrity credibility and identity so you fill those gaps with defensiveness.
[00:17:04] Underneath all of this underneath this perpetual pattern of defensiveness taking things personally is a deep rooted feeling i'm not enough so i must prove it you know there's a client of mine born and raised in Switzerland then at the age of five he switched villages you know he moved to the another part of the country.
[00:17:30] And new kid new school one of his earliest childhood moments something we unpacked together during one of our coaching sessions was a couple weeks into school you know he's just started kindergarten.
[00:17:44] There was an incident where one of the kids in his class was picking on another kid and inevitably something happened where something valuable in the classroom that belonged to the teachers broke.
[00:17:57] My client this new kid just blending in didn't stand at all suddenly became the mark of blame for this incident.
[00:18:08] Why because it was easy the teacher was out of the room for a moment everybody blame the new kid even though other classmates in this instance knew it wasn't him nobody spoke up for him so here he is a couple weeks into a new village in new school and he's instantly believed in the school.
[00:18:25] He was blamed made to feel not only angry sad confused and disappointed but embarrassed in front of the whole class all he wanted to do was fit in belong feel accepted by this new peer group and he was singled out blamed for something he didn't do.
[00:18:42] Of course now as adults we can look back and see that perhaps it's no big deal it's not that significant but for that five six year old little boy it was everything.
[00:18:55] It's the moments like this were beliefs form this little boy learn that he had to be on the defensive he started taking things personally and we fast forward not years decades later he's incredibly reactive and defensive in the workspace he's climbed the corporate ladder of his engineering consulting firm.
[00:19:15] But where for the longest time he constantly faced negative and harsh feedback was his ability to lead is ability to effectively communicate and take criticism he was constantly in the CEO and his supervisor's office going through this pattern of you know what I don't like how she said that about me I can't believe he said that about me taking things personally and it was costing him dearly energy.
[00:19:46] Reputation progress connection relationships all because this incident shaped disbelief that he wasn't enough as he is he had to defend himself constantly on the defense now that's just one example.
[00:20:05] But having done this with thousands of clients over the years I tell you this example is not unique to him it runs rampant in the clients I work with it looks a little different in every situation of course but the heart of this I'm not enough is I've got to prove myself or if I'm question and I already believe I'm not enough I'm exposed so therefore I've got to defend defend I got to protect my name protect my honor and all of this lack of enoughness translates to I'm not good enough I haven't.
[00:20:33] Earned by spot I could be found out I need to prove myself so when someone begins to challenge you even subtly or even something that's not meant to be a challenge yet you perceive it to be because your nervous system is stuck in fight or flight your system your subconscious your nervous system interprets it as a threat to survival so that's why you interrupt.
[00:20:59] You over explain you dominate conversations you overwork you over control you struggle mightily to receive feedback anger becomes your armor defensiveness becomes protection and reactivity it becomes identity preservation
[00:21:29] So let's talk about some common examples of where and how this shows up I want to push those buttons of pain a little bit more in your day to day business whether you're the team leader just an employee right now perhaps you suffer from defensive reactions to questions from investors and teammates you over react to broker or agent feedback you micromanage your teams instead of trusting them
[00:21:59] your guilty of burning bridges with vendors partners you need to win conversations with team members instead of feeling aligned and on the same page you make impulsive decisions after feeling disrespected
[00:22:17] in leadership it might become so blatant that team member stop challenging you it's no longer a safe space for honest feedback and discussion problems go underground and culture becomes a thing of the past
[00:22:36] even more you start to bring this business stress home you're emotionally shut down constantly irritable you've got a short fuse with your spouse your kids and you ultimately just feel misunderstood and alone even if you're at the top
[00:22:49] so my question for you is what is taking things personally costing you
[00:23:01] how is continuing to take things personal holding you back
[00:23:10] well I'll tell you this reactivity cost you energy clarity trust strategic thinking emotional safety with others long term relationships
[00:23:29] and perhaps most damaging it keeps you stuck in survival mode when your next level of success requires regulation presence and leadership
[00:23:42] so what do we do remember this is a pattern this is a learned pattern of believing feeling thinking and behaving which means it can be unlearned feeling attacked doesn't mean you're weak
[00:23:59] it means something inside of you is asking for attention and the goal is into eliminate emotion you are an emotional being the goal is to shift
[00:24:10] from unconscious reaction to conscious response to reclaim power choice and autonomy and to respond from alignment not fear
[00:24:28] this looks like nervous system regulation identity level belief rewiring learning to pause instead of perform
[00:24:38] but before you can do any of that you've got to identify the pattern and I have an imagination if you listened in today
[00:24:46] and this conversation resonated with you you're beginning to bring more clarity to a pattern you knew existed already than you've had ever
[00:24:56] and that's a great first step identifying acknowledging you can't just skip to the letting go you've got to acknowledge this pattern
[00:25:06] you've got to accept it and that can be challenged to do that yes I take things personally I'm on the attack I'm defensive I'm rude critical reactive harsh irritable
[00:25:20] you've got to sit with that for a little while and spoil alert spoiler alert there it is it might be fucking uncomfortable but this is who you are and this is where you are now
[00:25:34] from there and this is this is why I love adjournaling practices why I constantly share prompts reflective questions on my episodes here is just to give you some tools to better dig in
[00:25:46] through a lens of non-judgmental curiosity think about the last few things that triggered you you took personally that you reacted from a place of defensiveness
[00:25:58] what was the incident what was said why do you feel you reacted that way was there truth in what was said
[00:26:09] get curious here and always underneath all this what is taking things personally costing you
[00:26:20] and perhaps even more the question isn't necessarily why do I get triggered the better the real question is
[00:26:28] what are you still trying to protect and what would happen if you didn't have to
[00:26:36] and what I want to encourage you to keep in mind as you move forward are the four peas
[00:26:47] paws a moment you feel the cascade of emotion flooding throughout every cell in your body when you've been triggered
[00:26:55] paws find your breath begin to process what you're experiencing go one step further and name it label it I feel angry I feel rageful
[00:27:11] I feel sad I feel called out so you're pausing then you're processing
[00:27:20] and that pauls in processing in and of itself should help you make a pivot it's a third pea and how you choose to move forward no longer from a place of unconscious fast reaction the pauls in processing is the process in and of self of allowing you to shift to conscious response
[00:27:36] so you pauls you process you pivot on how you're going to proceed or what you're going to say and then you literally proceed
[00:27:44] pauls process pivot proceed four peas to show up better to let go of taking things personally
[00:27:56] I mean that's the first of the four agreements don't take things personally another good book recommendation for you
[00:28:03] because you and I both know continuing to be stuck in this pattern of taking things personally lacked in fight or flight always on the defensive is costing you dearly in your income your impact your relationships your fulfillment your happiness your confidence your success it's got to go
[00:28:20] and if I can help you let go I invite you to use the link in the show notes to schedule a mindset performance coaching discovery call with me

Today, we're talking about your pattern of taking things personally, constantly feeling on edge, like you're under attack, which leads to you being reactive, rather than responsive, on the defensive, rather than diligently and patiently on the offensive. When you feel attacked, it's rarely about the present moment. It's typically because of one or more of these three things. Number one, your nervous system is wired for threat. Number two, there's an element of truth in the statement that was shared with you. Number three, there's an incongruency between who you say you are and how you're showing up. So let's begin to unpack these to bring some clarity and most importantly awareness as to why you are prone to react this way. In so many situations that don't warrant this offensive attack, this verbal assault that typically plays out after the fact that leaves you stuck feeling regret, sadness, ashamed, guilty, disappointed in yourself having to make amends apologize one time after the next. So let's talk about it. First and foremost, like I mentioned, if you're experiencing this feeling that you're always on attack, taking things personally, your nervous system is just locked into and stuck in fight or flight. Past experiences have taught you that criticism equals danger. Typically if you struggle to truly hear and accept criticism, there is a breadcrumb of past experiences that has highlighted for you or made you feel to believe that when you are criticized, you are not enough. And if you are not enough, you are not worthy, you are not deserving, maybe of love, maybe of belonging, maybe of connection, maybe of money, maybe you grew up needing to perform to be accepted, maybe you were only praised when you produced results. Maybe you learned early that mistakes had consequences and sometimes unfair, unjust consequences. And as a result, you got stuck in this perpetual pattern of being ashamed, dismissed or emotionally invalidated. So now every time you receive criticism or something that has perceived as criticism, it's an actual threat on your identity, your well-being. And your nervous system reacts well before logic gets involved. Number two, and this is a big one. Listen closely here. When you are consistently engaged in this pattern of taking things personally, one major reason this might exist is because there is truth in that statement. This one stings. Sometimes the reason you take things so personally, and that it hits so hard is because it's something you already deep down believe about yourself, believe to be true, yet you hate it and you work so hard to deny, repress or avoid ever connecting with the part of yourself you hate. Maybe it's around your lack of organization, your procrastination tendencies, you're over promising an under delivering pattern, you're not available as you say you are deals feel sloppy messy rushed come together the last minute. And I'm reminded of a funny story, I call it funny now, it wasn't funny in the moment. For the longest time, there was a prominent person in my life who drove me batshit crazy, I felt she was incredibly manipulative. Always finagling the system, having extra conversations between working parties to get things to land in her favor. Things would change the last second, things would we would do x, y, and z, but last minute they become a b and c, and it just felt like these manipulative tendencies were growing more pronounced the longer and more time I spent with this individual. It wasn't until a couple years later that this individual was no longer in my life that I opened my eyes and my heart to the root of awakening and truth of the matter. I too had those manipulative tendencies I too wanted things to fall in my favor work out to my advantage or be more convenient for me and how I was choosing to spend my time what was happening here and this is the key point I want you to take is that when a behavior or something that is said by another person triggers you. It's a mirror of a part of yourself you don't like have disowned or are trying to hide and this phenomenon is known as the holographic universe and it's a theory of the universe that proposes every small piece of a hologram contains the information of the entire image you break it apart and each fragment still holds the whole just express different. What does that mean? You are not only confident or only anxious or only disciplined your collection of multiple parts confident anxious patient selfish optimistic angry compassionate jealous loving all of these co exist within you different parts well they show up in different moments at different intensities every part is real every part is every part belongs. When someone's behavior sets you off or when a common is made about a part of you you have actively worked to dismiss repressor deny whether it be laziness anger neediness sloppiness it's often because you are hiding that part of you it is true you do have that part or those tendencies it may not be the trait that you lead with might not be the characteristic you're most proud of it may even be the trait that you tried hardest to deny or have. High but it is there and when the outside world activates it you react that to them but to the part of you that feels exposed in a quick sidebar a book I cannot recommend enough that further dives into this topic of your triggers are your teachers is called the dark side of the light chasers by Debbie Ford this book describes the phenomenon of the holotropic universe it introduces more depth and detail around shadow work and I can't recommend it enough it's something I recommend for the vast majority of my clients and it really it just paints the picture that other people are your mirrors and what triggers you can be your teacher if you choose to look inward with courage and curiosity to confront accept acknowledge and begin doing the work to let go and into green. Back on track here the third reason you are so prone to taking things personally is there's an incongruency between who you say you are and how you're showing up you know this is the quiet killer you see yourself as discipline reliable high integrity a strong leader but lately you're cutting corners you're avoiding hard converse you know you're not going to be the one who's in the middle of that. You're rushing decisions operating from fatigue not clarity this internal gap who you think you are and say you are versus who you're showing up as an acting as that gap creates doubt it also creates emotional fragility meaning you are more on edge and more prone to being reactive when you hear something that ruffles your feathers or confronts a part of you that you are not willing to own and exit. And when that doubt exists when that emotional fragility exists the littlest of comments can set you off because they feel like a massive threat to your integrity credibility and identity so you fill those gaps with defensiveness. Underneath all of this underneath this perpetual pattern of defensiveness taking things personally is a deep rooted feeling i'm not enough so i must prove it you know there's a client of mine born and raised in Switzerland then at the age of five he switched villages you know he moved to the another part of the country. And new kid new school one of his earliest childhood moments something we unpacked together during one of our coaching sessions was a couple weeks into school you know he's just started kindergarten. There was an incident where one of the kids in his class was picking on another kid and inevitably something happened where something valuable in the classroom that belonged to the teachers broke. My client this new kid just blending in didn't stand at all suddenly became the mark of blame for this incident. Why because it was easy the teacher was out of the room for a moment everybody blame the new kid even though other classmates in this instance knew it wasn't him nobody spoke up for him so here he is a couple weeks into a new village in new school and he's instantly believed in the school. He was blamed made to feel not only angry sad confused and disappointed but embarrassed in front of the whole class all he wanted to do was fit in belong feel accepted by this new peer group and he was singled out blamed for something he didn't do. Of course now as adults we can look back and see that perhaps it's no big deal it's not that significant but for that five six year old little boy it was everything. It's the moments like this were beliefs form this little boy learn that he had to be on the defensive he started taking things personally and we fast forward not years decades later he's incredibly reactive and defensive in the workspace he's climbed the corporate ladder of his engineering consulting firm. But where for the longest time he constantly faced negative and harsh feedback was his ability to lead is ability to effectively communicate and take criticism he was constantly in the CEO and his supervisor's office going through this pattern of you know what I don't like how she said that about me I can't believe he said that about me taking things personally and it was costing him dearly energy. Reputation progress connection relationships all because this incident shaped disbelief that he wasn't enough as he is he had to defend himself constantly on the defense now that's just one example. But having done this with thousands of clients over the years I tell you this example is not unique to him it runs rampant in the clients I work with it looks a little different in every situation of course but the heart of this I'm not enough is I've got to prove myself or if I'm question and I already believe I'm not enough I'm exposed so therefore I've got to defend defend I got to protect my name protect my honor and all of this lack of enoughness translates to I'm not good enough I haven't. Earned by spot I could be found out I need to prove myself so when someone begins to challenge you even subtly or even something that's not meant to be a challenge yet you perceive it to be because your nervous system is stuck in fight or flight your system your subconscious your nervous system interprets it as a threat to survival so that's why you interrupt. You over explain you dominate conversations you overwork you over control you struggle mightily to receive feedback anger becomes your armor defensiveness becomes protection and reactivity it becomes identity preservation So let's talk about some common examples of where and how this shows up I want to push those buttons of pain a little bit more in your day to day business whether you're the team leader just an employee right now perhaps you suffer from defensive reactions to questions from investors and teammates you over react to broker or agent feedback you micromanage your teams instead of trusting them your guilty of burning bridges with vendors partners you need to win conversations with team members instead of feeling aligned and on the same page you make impulsive decisions after feeling disrespected in leadership it might become so blatant that team member stop challenging you it's no longer a safe space for honest feedback and discussion problems go underground and culture becomes a thing of the past even more you start to bring this business stress home you're emotionally shut down constantly irritable you've got a short fuse with your spouse your kids and you ultimately just feel misunderstood and alone even if you're at the top so my question for you is what is taking things personally costing you how is continuing to take things personal holding you back well I'll tell you this reactivity cost you energy clarity trust strategic thinking emotional safety with others long term relationships and perhaps most damaging it keeps you stuck in survival mode when your next level of success requires regulation presence and leadership so what do we do remember this is a pattern this is a learned pattern of believing feeling thinking and behaving which means it can be unlearned feeling attacked doesn't mean you're weak it means something inside of you is asking for attention and the goal is into eliminate emotion you are an emotional being the goal is to shift from unconscious reaction to conscious response to reclaim power choice and autonomy and to respond from alignment not fear this looks like nervous system regulation identity level belief rewiring learning to pause instead of perform but before you can do any of that you've got to identify the pattern and I have an imagination if you listened in today and this conversation resonated with you you're beginning to bring more clarity to a pattern you knew existed already than you've had ever and that's a great first step identifying acknowledging you can't just skip to the letting go you've got to acknowledge this pattern you've got to accept it and that can be challenged to do that yes I take things personally I'm on the attack I'm defensive I'm rude critical reactive harsh irritable you've got to sit with that for a little while and spoil alert spoiler alert there it is it might be fucking uncomfortable but this is who you are and this is where you are now from there and this is this is why I love adjournaling practices why I constantly share prompts reflective questions on my episodes here is just to give you some tools to better dig in through a lens of non-judgmental curiosity think about the last few things that triggered you you took personally that you reacted from a place of defensiveness what was the incident what was said why do you feel you reacted that way was there truth in what was said get curious here and always underneath all this what is taking things personally costing you and perhaps even more the question isn't necessarily why do I get triggered the better the real question is what are you still trying to protect and what would happen if you didn't have to and what I want to encourage you to keep in mind as you move forward are the four peas paws a moment you feel the cascade of emotion flooding throughout every cell in your body when you've been triggered paws find your breath begin to process what you're experiencing go one step further and name it label it I feel angry I feel rageful I feel sad I feel called out so you're pausing then you're processing and that pauls in processing in and of itself should help you make a pivot it's a third pea and how you choose to move forward no longer from a place of unconscious fast reaction the pauls in processing is the process in and of self of allowing you to shift to conscious response so you pauls you process you pivot on how you're going to proceed or what you're going to say and then you literally proceed pauls process pivot proceed four peas to show up better to let go of taking things personally I mean that's the first of the four agreements don't take things personally another good book recommendation for you because you and I both know continuing to be stuck in this pattern of taking things personally lacked in fight or flight always on the defensive is costing you dearly in your income your impact your relationships your fulfillment your happiness
