[00:01:21] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:25] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:29] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:33] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:35] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:38] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:42] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:48] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:53] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:58] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.

[00:02:07] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:11] Not only does it do that, but corded AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:16] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:17] So now when I'm recruiting, corded AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:22] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:25] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:27] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.

[00:04:46] Let me tell you more about Nick.
[00:04:48] Now, Nick Harris is a licensed REALTOR based in the Metro Detroit Michigan area with a passion
[00:04:53] for real estate that dates back to his college years.
[00:04:56] What began as a self-taught exploration of real estate, investing quickly turned into a thriving
[00:05:01] career.
[00:05:02] After starting his journey at United wholesale mortgage, Nick knew he was ready to make the leap
[00:05:07] to become a full-time REALTOR with just, this isn't, well, I'm going to get to the incredible
[00:05:11] part in a second.
[00:05:12] He basically got his license within two weeks, jumped in, on board, and this is what is really
[00:05:18] amazing.
[00:05:18] Since then, Nick has closed an impressive average.
[00:05:21] This is his average of 103 homes per year for the last three years.
[00:05:28] He does not have a team.
[00:05:29] It is just him. 103 homes per year for the last three years, building a reputation as a top
[00:05:35] performer in the area.
[00:05:36] But what truly sets him apart is his dedication to not only growing his business, but also mentoring
[00:05:41] fellow agents.
[00:05:42] Nick is passionate about helping other REALTOR's, build long-term success, showing them how to not
[00:05:47] only make a living, but to set themselves and their families up for long-term wealth
[00:05:51] and financial security.
[00:05:53] Today, he's committed to sharing his knowledge and experience with others to help them reach
[00:05:57] their full potential in the real estate industry.

[00:06:24] I really encourage everyone to go back a few episodes and listen to Nick's first appearance.
[00:06:31] Now, he wasn't a guest on the show in the traditional sense that he is today, but he was part
[00:06:35] of our very first ever webinar.
[00:06:38] And by the way, we have another one coming up.

[00:07:07] But please go back and listen to Nick's appearance because what he did was was number one.
[00:07:12] It was incredibly courageous and vulnerable.
[00:07:15] Nick basically bared his business soul to an alive coaching session.
[00:07:20] Nick came on board with somebody from the locker room and a Brent Scott,
[00:07:24] who is an amazing coach and Brent walked Nick through his entire business
[00:07:28] where Nick scored himself in various aspects.
[00:07:32] And Nick is doing really, really well in his business.

[00:08:25] All right, Nick.
[00:08:26] Let's get to you.
[00:08:27] Sorry about the big commercial there.
[00:08:28] But I was really excited to continue to do this.
[00:08:31] And thank you for being part of our first one.
[00:08:33] Nick reached out to me, which was, I always love it when agents do that.
[00:08:38] And it was so kind.
[00:08:40] And he had a lot of nice things to say about our show.
[00:08:43] And we just love it when agents listen.
[00:08:46] And we really appreciate you.
[00:08:47] So now let's talk about how you got involved with real estate.
[00:08:52] So walk us through it.
[00:08:53] How did you make the switch?
[00:08:55] Yeah, so again, I appreciate you having me on.
[00:08:59] I got interested in real estate.
[00:09:01] And you mentioned it in the bio and thanks for that.
[00:09:05] But got interested in real estate from an investment standpoint.
[00:09:08] So I can trace back to like 11th, 12th grade in high school,
[00:09:14] where I had an interest in real estate investing.
[00:09:17] New I wanted to build some type of rental portfolio.
[00:09:20] And so it started with just self education.
[00:09:22] That was my first experience with real estate.
[00:09:25] All of just self educating.
[00:09:27] And then I actually went to college, played college baseball.
[00:09:31] Got my degree in something completely different.
[00:09:33] Like most people do in health and exercise science.
[00:09:36] Out of college became a strength conditioning coach.
[00:09:40] Then went on to be a personal trainer and then COVID hit.
[00:09:44] And so obviously that industry kind of got thrown for a loop.
[00:09:48] And I took on a position as an account executive at United
[00:09:51] wholesale mortgage.
[00:09:52] So my first job in real estate in some degree was for a mortgage lender
[00:09:57] United wholesale mortgage, which is out of Michigan here.
[00:10:00] And so I was an account executive there.
[00:10:02] I worked on it was business to business.
[00:10:04] So I wasn't having conversations with buyers and sellers.
[00:10:07] I was having conversations with loan officers and brokers and loved it.
[00:10:12] But started to get this feel for the real estate agent side of things.
[00:10:16] And again, it wasn't something that I considered again, just self educating.
[00:10:19] And that's kind of when I picked up on different YouTube university,
[00:10:24] but also podcasts like keeping it real podcast.
[00:10:27] And started to listen to some things as far as not only real estate investing,
[00:10:31] but also becoming a potential agent.
[00:10:33] So when I was at UWM or United wholesale mortgage,
[00:10:37] we my little section got sent home because somebody had caught COVID.
[00:10:42] So we all got sent home working from home.
[00:10:44] And I thought, okay, this is the perfect opportunity for me now to actually have the time to study
[00:10:49] for my real estate license exam.
[00:10:52] So first week I was home with sent home for 14 days.
[00:10:55] First week, study for the exam.
[00:10:57] Second week, took it, passed it.
[00:11:00] Went back to the office, was actually planning on giving my two weeks notice,
[00:11:03] because I wanted to dive in as a real estate agent full time headfirst.
[00:11:07] And when I went back, another loop got a promotion.
[00:11:11] So stuck with it, I'm like, okay, let me see what I can do for.
[00:11:13] Let's see what this offers for a little bit.
[00:11:15] And after about a month of doing it, I was still just sitting with.
[00:11:18] I was sitting on my license, not actively doing anything, just waiting.
[00:11:22] And then made the decision, okay, I'm going to jump into real estate.
[00:11:25] As a real estate agent full time.
[00:11:27] So that's kind of how like the ball got rolling as far as when I got licensed.
[00:11:31] And I got licensed back in June of 2021.
[00:11:33] So this upcoming June of 2025 will be the end of year four.
[00:11:39] So I want to skip to the end of your first year and then kind of work backwards.
[00:11:44] So how did you do in your first year?
[00:11:46] Yeah, so first year.
[00:11:48] So first, so again, I started in June.
[00:11:50] So I kind of look at it in two different phases, right?
[00:11:52] Because you have all of I had June all the way through December of 2021.
[00:11:57] And then you kind of kick through December to June again,
[00:12:00] it's like my first calendar year.
[00:12:01] Sure, for my first calendar year, I believe the numbers.
[00:12:06] I believe I closed around 80 transactions in that first calendar year.
[00:12:11] And I forgot the volume of that.
[00:12:14] But our average price point in the metro Detroit area is around like 350 to 400.
[00:12:19] But I was working with
[00:12:22] primarily a lot of investors to start.
[00:12:24] So it was lower price points.
[00:12:26] Again, it was something that I had a passion for.
[00:12:28] And at that time, I wasn't yet an investor.
[00:12:31] I didn't have a portfolio of my own.
[00:12:33] But knew the lingo, knew the conversation,
[00:12:35] knew the numbers, knew what people were looking for because I had been studying it on my own.
[00:12:39] And so that's kind of where I jumped in that first,
[00:12:41] because that was all I knew as a real estate agent.
[00:12:43] And my career has progressed to primarily working with
[00:12:48] primary home buyers and sellers where we sit today.
[00:12:51] Yeah, let's talk about jumping into the investor space,
[00:12:55] which is not a common pathway for a new agent.
[00:12:59] Right? There are usually, I'm sure a lot of our listeners
[00:13:02] would like to add in working with investors onto their client lists.
[00:13:08] But most agents I talk to do not start that way.
[00:13:11] They start out as you're doing now with primary home buyers and sellers.
[00:13:15] So when you were starting out, how were you able to sort of,
[00:13:21] because well, let's talk about finding investors.
[00:13:24] Because a lot of times people who don't work with investors might think,
[00:13:27] well, do I have to have an investor first before I can start finding opportunities?
[00:13:34] So walk us through the process of what comes first?
[00:13:38] You find the deal and then you find the investor or you find the investor first and then the deal.
[00:13:42] Yeah, so the way that it worked for me specifically was I found the investor first and then
[00:13:46] found the deal. Right? So I have been running numbers and looking at different things on my own,
[00:13:51] again, just in my own interest. But for me, it worked out where I found the investor or investors first
[00:13:56] and then found the deal for them. So for me, again, I came from Health and Exercise field and I was
[00:14:02] a personal trainer. I was a personal trainer at the Diamond Club. We have a we have a chain
[00:14:07] gym here called Lifetime and it was the Diamond Club. One of the most expensive gyms in the
[00:14:13] area. So you're kind of around that clientele. And in a lot of that, just normal conversation with
[00:14:19] my client, as the client that I was training, I noticed a trend of upwards of 50, 60, 70 percent
[00:14:25] of them had real estate investment. So it kind of started there, right? Because I transitioned
[00:14:32] out of the personal training and the Health and Exercise Science field into working at a
[00:14:37] lender than I got my license. But I had those relationships still because I connected on a deeper
[00:14:41] level with those people. Remember that they had investment portfolios of their own, whether it was
[00:14:46] commercial or residential. And so that was a really easy conversation for me. I went right back
[00:14:51] into them. And so that was like, that was a small majority of where I went to the investor first.
[00:14:57] The rest of it for me was jumping into local REI, like real estate investing groups. So whether
[00:15:04] you can find something in your local market, for me, it was Facebook groups. So searching
[00:15:08] different investor groups in whatever state you're in for me, it's Michigan. And just asked to join
[00:15:14] those groups to have local meetups. So kind of connecting with different people and just having
[00:15:19] conversations. It really came from reaching out to people that I knew who had real estate investments
[00:15:23] from the investment side, but then also getting involved in some of the networks of the markets
[00:15:29] through for me, Facebook groups in my local area and going to some of those meetups and just
[00:15:34] having conversations. Yeah, that's really interesting. So you basically found the investors through,
[00:15:41] you know, your personal training. And you know, this is brings up a good point for those of us that
[00:15:46] have part-time jobs. You know, if your part-time job can feed your business, whatever it might be,
[00:15:52] maybe you're a server at a restaurant or a bartender or a teacher or, you know, a nurse or
[00:15:59] really any profession that you service the public, you know, you have opportunities to say, oh,
[00:16:05] by the way, I also do this other thing. And so I really, that's, that's was great, great way. So
[00:16:12] you found the investors, you already knew how to find the opportunities because, of course,
[00:16:17] you were looking for those yourself as well as working on the mortgage side. You probably saw
[00:16:21] how deals got put together and what investors were looking for. And that's, that's amazing. So
[00:16:27] that makes perfect sense. I also have interviewed a lot of agents who didn't start with the investor
[00:16:32] list. They found the deals first. And then they, what I've heard from many people is find the deal
[00:16:39] and the money comes a lot faster than you might think because everybody wants a deal. Yeah.
[00:16:44] Anyone who's cash heavy is as interested in parking that cash somewhere that has good tax benefits
[00:16:49] and a nice rate of return. So that's, that's fantastic. I really love that. So now a lot of times
[00:16:55] people who work with investors stay on that track and that becomes their entire life or the vast
[00:17:00] majority of their business. You've decided to branch out and work with primary home buyers and
[00:17:05] sellers, you know, the retail folks. So tell us about why did you decide to add that into your
[00:17:13] business and and how has that transition been going for you? Yeah. So the switch initially
[00:17:20] happens. They're going from focusing on investors to retail or primary home buyers and sellers.
[00:17:25] Happen number one for the motive of again, the investments in my market tend to be cash flow heavy.
[00:17:31] We're not, you know, the metroidy trade market is not a super high appreciation market. Now,
[00:17:35] of course, we have appreciation, but it's not a super high appreciation market. It's not sure.
[00:17:39] It's not your Airbnb or your short-term rental. It's more so your long-term rental properties.
[00:17:44] And so average price points lower, right? So I was, what I found was the amount of worth that I
[00:17:50] had to do to make the income that I wanted was double the amount of triple because of the price
[00:17:54] point. So for me, it came from a a want to service higher price points. And in addition to that,
[00:18:01] it gives you the ability to step back a little bit instead of closing, you know, 100 transactions
[00:18:05] a year you could do half for twice the purchase price or the sales price and still have the same
[00:18:12] outcome as far as income as a real estate agent. So that was really for me. That was the motivating
[00:18:17] factor of, and not only that, but also like I wasn't solely working with investors at the beginning,
[00:18:23] right? Like it was, it was a good chunk of my business, but I thoroughly enjoyed the process of
[00:18:29] helping someone, whether it was a first-time home buyer or helping somebody to downsize or to
[00:18:34] scale up or they had a need to move rather than just looking to make an investment. So I really
[00:18:39] started to enjoy that. And the same thing on the sales side, like I loved helping people capitalize
[00:18:43] on that career at their home and make as much as they could. We're all incentivized to do that,
[00:18:47] right? So that was what I really just started my momentum started going that way. And that's
[00:18:51] that's what I took my focus to and it's been going great. You know, in my, the most sales I've had
[00:18:58] in a year and the reason that, and I know you mentioned at the beginning, about it is 103 transactions
[00:19:02] a year over the last three years. Three years ago, it's slowly gone down, right? So three years ago,
[00:19:08] that was because it was 121 transactions, and I went to 118, and then I made the sole focus of,
[00:19:14] okay, I want to work with primary buyers and sellers now. So I cut my transactions in almost half.
[00:19:19] I think this pasture I closed 67, but the total sales volume went up north of 2 million. So
[00:19:27] half the deals were 2 million more in total volume. That's a good, a good exchange. That is, so
[00:19:34] I, you know, I was going to make a joke that you're slipping, but you know, you're becoming way more
[00:19:38] efficient and effective. That is truly incredible. So you saw bigger opportunity, maybe with the,
[00:19:46] or at least less, less hours with bigger opportunity. Yeah. And boy, that makes perfect sense. And
[00:19:53] what a great thing to sort of recognize. But a different skill set, right? Like working with
[00:19:58] primary home buyers and sellers is a different, tell us about what are the main differences between
[00:20:04] helping an investor secure property and helping, you know, someone buying their primary residents.
[00:20:10] Yeah. So, you know, for investors, a lot of it comes down to the numbers, right? The numbers
[00:20:14] have to make sense. And based on their criteria, they're looking for a long term buying hold,
[00:20:18] or they look something that's going to cash flow, be cash flow heavier, they're looking for something
[00:20:22] that's going to be appreciation heavy because on the investment scale, you kind of can look at it
[00:20:27] on either under the spectrum, right? It's either going to favor cash flow or it's going to favor
[00:20:32] appreciation. And it's hard to find that middle ground, right? So as far as that's concerned,
[00:20:39] it, you know, it's investors is more so about the numbers. Does it make sense financially?
[00:20:44] And doesn't make sense based on their criteria for a primary home buyer and seller, obviously,
[00:20:48] you know, let's talk buyer because investors were buying buyers are going to buy their next home.
[00:20:52] Of course, it has to fit the criteria that they have or the need that they want for the home.
[00:20:55] It has to have X amount of bedrooms or bathrooms or square footage or this school district,
[00:20:59] that school district, but a lot of it is emotional as well. So it's a different, it's a different
[00:21:04] spin. And for us, we are in the sales industry. It's a different spin on helping someone come to a
[00:21:09] decision based on what they told you, take that information. And instead of it being about numbers,
[00:21:13] oftentimes, the numbers are still involved. It still has to financially make sense for them,
[00:21:17] but it's also about that emotional process and what they are looking for and getting them into
[00:21:22] that home. Did you find that the transition was an easy one for you going from more of the,
[00:21:29] we'll say, left brain side, the logical, you know, just get the numbers to make sense. I'm an investor.
[00:21:35] I don't have too much emotion other than how my financial part of it is doing versus the home owner
[00:21:40] who, of course, once the financial security do, but also has a lot tied to, of course, where they live.
[00:21:46] Was that transition easy for you or was it a different skill set to learn?
[00:21:51] Not necessarily. It wasn't like a huge, wasn't a huge skill set change. You know, the same thing
[00:21:57] still go into it. It's still a real estate transaction due diligence is still the same.
[00:22:03] And the conversation is still the same. For me, it was just a little bit more fun to have the
[00:22:07] conversations with, you know, with primary home buyers and sellers and talk about that and what
[00:22:12] it means for them and their family. Same thing on the investment side, like it still has a lasting,
[00:22:16] you know, impression on them and their family and they're doing that for a reason. But for me,
[00:22:20] it was more fun to do that with primary buyers and sellers.
[00:22:24] You feel like you're making a different impact and maybe one that's a more personalized impact
[00:22:29] and one that maybe is more meaningful to, you know, to the purchaser or seller. That's wonderful.
[00:22:37] So you found that that's what you enjoy doing the most. Although I'm sure you still help investors
[00:22:42] as well. I'm sure that's not completely stopped. But making that transition is not very easy either
[00:22:51] because those two types of clients, those two client avatars, the investor and the primary
[00:22:57] you know, primary property owner or buyer is, you know, they're looking for different things
[00:23:06] and they're not congregating in the same spaces. So how did you start to find, you know,
[00:23:12] somebody looking to buy a seller primary residence? And you know, we understand how you found the
[00:23:17] investors and but how did you find the regular clients? Yeah. So for me, I have a handful of lead
[00:23:24] pillars that I that I really died in. So number one is fear of influence or SOI. Just the people
[00:23:31] that I know, right? Roll it X to people, others in your contacts, whether you know them from
[00:23:35] middle school, high school, college, local gym, whatever child's daycare, whatever the case may be
[00:23:41] and then just people who know and like and trust you. So number one is your fear of influence,
[00:23:44] just staying in contact with them. And through that also is social media, right? It's a good
[00:23:50] medium to stay top of mind and have conversations and stay involved in people's lives. So I kind of
[00:23:56] group those two, although it's one A and one B, I kind of group that into one because, you know,
[00:24:01] that it's it's my fear of influence and this is the people that I that I'm regularly staying
[00:24:05] in contact with and so or with. So fear of influence number two would be past clients and referrals.
[00:24:10] Obviously having the ability to work with those type of people and get referrals from them or have
[00:24:15] them repeat, you know, sales, maybe they bought a home four years ago and they need to they need
[00:24:20] to up size and they need to downsize, right? So number two would be past clients and referrals.
[00:24:25] And then number three, where I get a majority of my business from is actually outbound.
[00:24:31] Prospecting with circle prospecting or geographic farming and neighborhood dialing. So that's been
[00:24:37] a huge, huge one for me because that's that's allowing me now to get in contact with actual homeowners,
[00:24:44] people who own a home that also need that are looking to sell number one or potentially looking to
[00:24:49] sell, but they also if they sell, they need to move and buy somewhere and whether it's local and
[00:24:54] I can work with them on both of those. So it gives, you know, it's the same client for two transactions
[00:24:58] or they may be looking to move out of state. And so it's a good referral of passive approach to
[00:25:02] the real estate, to the real estate business as well. I want to tackle all three of these. I've been
[00:25:08] taking notes because I don't want to miss any of this because you have you first of all, you know
[00:25:13] your numbers, which is amazing and and you also understand what's working for you and what isn't
[00:25:19] and how to make refinements. So I want to start with fear of influence because that might seem
[00:25:23] the most obvious to our listeners. Of course, we should be staying in contact with the people that
[00:25:27] already know like and trust us. I'd like any talked about using social media as part of the
[00:25:32] strategy for that and I'm assuming also reaching out directly to those people, the one-to-one
[00:25:37] conversations maybe I don't know if you're texting or phone calls or email or all, but can you walk
[00:25:42] us through a little bit about how do you stay in touch with your sphere? Yeah, so a couple of different
[00:25:47] and again, I call them my game plans or my place. Again, coming in from the from the athletic
[00:25:53] background, like if I have a game plan in front of me, it's easy for me to implement. So I have a
[00:25:56] couple of things that I do on a regular basis during a normal week, work week. So Monday through
[00:26:01] Friday, Monday through Friday, I do what I call a social 3333 and you can plug whatever number you
[00:26:08] want into them. Maybe do a social 4444555, whatever it is, but for me, social media, I'm going to follow
[00:26:14] three new people today. So that's the first three, three new follows, whether it's Facebook,
[00:26:19] Instagram, whatever, medium that you're on. You following them. Correct. Yep. So it could be mutual
[00:26:25] friends. It could be if you go to your local gym or you go to a restaurant often or you go to
[00:26:30] whatever it might be or your child's daycare and they have a page, you might just see that you
[00:26:34] know, follow three of those people and I'll put you in front of them. So this is so this is again
[00:26:39] just building that database. So number one is three new follows or friend requests. Number three is three
[00:26:45] or number two is three comments on a post, whether it's a real or someone's post. And then the third
[00:26:50] category is three direct messages. So it's three follows, three comments, three direct messages.
[00:26:55] Again, just staying top of mind, staying relevant, nothing to do with real estate at all. It's just
[00:26:59] being involved in people's lives. Maybe they got married a week ago and you saw them post about
[00:27:04] it. So you're going to comment or send them a direct message. So social 3333 and with my
[00:27:09] sphere of influence, I also run a play where Monday through Friday, I send out five video text messages
[00:27:15] or five text messages a day to my sphere of influence. And these are people that are I'm already in
[00:27:21] contact with or have contact with. So what I do for me, I just go into my phone contacts, right?
[00:27:28] For other people that might be their Facebook friends or might be their Instagram followers.
[00:27:32] For me, I just use my phone contacts and I start from A to Z. And on Monday, I'll start at A.
[00:27:40] And you know, maybe it's Aaron. Aaron is the first one. I'm going to send Aaron, depending on if
[00:27:43] I've had a conversation with Aaron in the past or if I maybe I haven't talked to Aaron in a year,
[00:27:48] right? I'm just going to send the reason I like video text messages because it's more personal.
[00:27:52] People are generally more likely to open it when they can and in a scenario where they can respond,
[00:27:57] rather than just read a text that never respond. And again, it's nothing. It's nothing
[00:28:01] real estate related. It's just checking in with people. Again, you might call out. You notice that
[00:28:05] Aaron went on a vacation last week to Florida and you know, you're just saying, Hey, Aaron,
[00:28:10] it's been a while. I was just cleaning up my contacts. It came across your name. I actually saw
[00:28:13] you went to Florida last week. It looked awesome. Hope you had good weather. We'd love to catch up
[00:28:17] with you and hear more about what's going on in your life. I hope you're doing well and let's catch
[00:28:21] up soon. Right. So I send five of those a day. One second. So thank you. That is amazing stuff.
[00:28:28] So you're using social media almost as a research and development arm of your company to see, hey,
[00:28:34] I'm going to call Aaron. I need to I want to talk about something with Aaron. Let me look to see if
[00:28:39] he's posted anything to see maybe I something I could talk about. If there's no posts, then you
[00:28:45] know, you might just check in. Hey, how's it going? I wanted to check in see how you're doing. How's
[00:28:48] work, but whatever. And are you doing that via like if your iPhone user are using FaceTime,
[00:28:54] are you using a third party solution like bomb bomb or loom? How are you doing that? Yeah. So for
[00:28:59] me, it's just it's just my phone. So I use my iPhone and I send a video, right? And if it's
[00:29:03] you know, oh, yeah, I'm sorry, not FaceTime. Yeah, just a video. Yeah. If you have the discrepancy of
[00:29:07] sometimes the videos don't show up great to Android's and vice versa. So you know, in those scenarios,
[00:29:12] maybe I just send a voice recording or I'll send an actual text message, but I try to send a
[00:29:15] video text message as often as I can. And yeah, it's just pick five. And what I found is as I'm
[00:29:21] working through my contacts and sending five a day Monday through Friday, it takes me, you know,
[00:29:25] each video is maybe 10 seconds long. If you have something to really talk about, maybe you're at
[00:29:30] like 30 seconds. But I sent five a day and what I found is I get through my entire contact list
[00:29:35] about once a quarter. So now I'm doing that again, starting over a disease and I'm in contact
[00:29:40] with those people four times a year at a minimum. So everyone gets four video messages from you.
[00:29:45] By the way, pro tip for anyone listening. If you are an iPhone user, I don't know how to do this
[00:29:51] the reverse way, but as an iPhone user, if you are sending messages and you are sending them to
[00:29:57] an Android user, it does. It can and may degrade the quality because Apple has a closed system.
[00:30:02] And that's just how they play. But what you can do is you can copy the iCloud link and send
[00:30:09] them the direct link and they can view that directly in a web browser. So there is a way to get it
[00:30:14] to them. And it looks almost identical to if you were to send them, in other words, it shows up
[00:30:19] almost identically in their text chain as it would if you would have sent it directly to them.
[00:30:24] So for anyone out there who has got a lot of Android users in your in your sphere, in your contact
[00:30:29] list, consider that as a little pro tip. So I love that. So every one of your customers,
[00:30:35] sorry, every one of your friends, really, everybody in your sphere gets four messages a day of,
[00:30:41] hey, just thinking about you, hope all as well. Let's catch up. How often, and I don't think the reason
[00:30:48] to do this are rather the expectation probably isn't, well, they're going to call me right back.
[00:30:53] Or I would assume most of them probably don't. But talk about why do you do this?
[00:30:59] Yeah, so again, again, like you mentioned, it's not always that you're going to get a response,
[00:31:03] it's not always that you're going to be that you're, I mean, the ultimate goal is to say,
[00:31:07] hey, Nick, thanks for reaching out. We're actually thinking about selling our house.
[00:31:10] Sure, of course. That's almost too easy, right?
[00:31:13] But that's up to the gods, right? So yeah.
[00:31:15] Right, so I mean, the whole part of it is that you at least put yourself in front of them,
[00:31:20] right? Even if they're not in a position to respond, even if they never respond,
[00:31:22] they heard from you, they might like the message or at least you know they got it, right?
[00:31:26] And it's just, it's just to be a person, be relevant, right?
[00:31:29] Be a human being, have conversations, let them know you're thinking about them, everybody likes to
[00:31:34] be thought of. And if you can bring up recent things in their lives, or you remember something
[00:31:40] that happened recently in their life and you can bring it up, or you bring up a memory of,
[00:31:43] you know, two years ago, the last time you saw me, you bring up a memory, like people like that stuff.
[00:31:47] So yeah, so that it's huge, you know, you just, for me, it's just staying top of mind being in front
[00:31:51] of people. And the same thing goes for social media, right? Not everyone likes your folks, not
[00:31:55] everyone is commenting underpost. But, you know, I can't tell you how many times I've
[00:31:59] gone to a wedding from a, from a friend in college and I haven't seen, you know, I haven't seen
[00:32:03] potentially the people that are at that wedding in five, six, seven, eight years. And someone will
[00:32:08] walk up to me and the first thing, one of the first things they say to me is it looks like you're,
[00:32:12] you're killing it in real estate. Like, congratulations, how's everything going, right? And I had no
[00:32:16] idea like other than being friends with them on social media, they haven't shown any interest.
[00:32:21] But it's being top of mind, it's being there. So that when someone thinks of real estate, it's,
[00:32:25] oh yeah, next to real estate agent, I see you doing really well, I should reach out to them.
[00:32:29] Yeah. And, and I, again, just that if everyone just did a video message to everyone in their
[00:32:34] sphere four times a year, you will see results from that. And you might not see them this year,
[00:32:39] you might not see them even next year because people would only buy and sell every seven years or
[00:32:43] so over primary residence. So it might not happen right away. But it is people remember, first of all,
[00:32:49] let's all think about does any service provider in our life? Anyone? Is it accountants, financial
[00:32:54] advisors, our dentist, our, you know, person who cuts our hair? You know, these are all service
[00:33:00] providers that, you know, you can always go elsewhere, our attorneys, you know, things like that,
[00:33:04] our accountant. How many of those are sending, how many of those are sending you a video message?
[00:33:09] I'm going to guess zero. So just by doing this alone, you're not only differentiating yourself
[00:33:14] for most REALTORS, 99% of REALTORS don't do this, but 99% of the other people they pay for
[00:33:20] a very services aren't doing this either. And, and you're not asking them for anything. You're not
[00:33:25] saying, I need to say all this month, I hope you're ready to buy yourself, which can come across
[00:33:30] in some of these messaging if you're not really showing authentic interest. So Nick is doing something
[00:33:35] very, very smart. And he's also an authentic person. He's doing this because he cares about people.
[00:33:40] And he's ultimately saying, how do I connect with you? I want to connect with you. I'm thinking
[00:33:45] about you. You're important to me. And I'll give you one other pro tip for those of you that are
[00:33:49] going, oh my gosh, I don't, you know, sometimes I don't know what to say. Nick just gave a bunch of
[00:33:53] examples of what he might say. You know, use LinkedIn for this too. Don't forget about LinkedIn.
[00:33:58] LinkedIn will tell you whether somebody's got a job promotion or if they've celebrated a milestone
[00:34:03] at their job, you know, how many years they've been there or you can also look up the company they
[00:34:08] work for and see on Google news. Maybe you should know the company they work for. If you do,
[00:34:13] look, see if there's anything cool going on in that company. Hey, I just saw an article. I'm
[00:34:16] such and such. Right? These are connectors. And Nick obviously does this really, really well. So
[00:34:21] cheers to you, Nick, for that. And now we want to talk about comments. So this is a pretty simple one.
[00:34:27] We're talking about social media comments on your 333. We're talking about, you know, basically just
[00:34:33] commenting on people's posts. I'm guessing saying, hey, that vacation looks awesome or, hey,
[00:34:38] that dinner looks great or glad your kids did that recital or is that sort of the type of. Yeah,
[00:34:43] yeah, exactly. Again, it's being top of mind. But with social media, it also helps the algorithm.
[00:34:48] Right? The more the more that DJ and I are in conversation, the more likely Instagram before
[00:34:53] using Instagram as an example, if DJ and I are in conversation, I'm more likely now to see DJ's
[00:34:59] post and DJ's more likely to see my post. So when I do go to post anything that it might be
[00:35:03] whether it's a video or if you are doing like just listed your soul, there's something to be said
[00:35:08] for that because it is a top of mind relevancy thing. But now you're more likely to see it. And
[00:35:13] if you're in contact with three new people a day sending comments or direct messages, those
[00:35:17] people are more likely to see your information. And again, it's that it's that human piece of just
[00:35:21] having conversation with people and commenting on what's going on in their life. Yeah, I'll share with
[00:35:26] everyone just a quick strategy that I'm using in the recruiting arm, which I think you can
[00:35:30] transpose this over into the how do I get clients side? So I used to think of really clever ways
[00:35:37] to recruit REALTORS via email and have cute little, you know, funny sayings or something that was
[00:35:44] make people chuckle or maybe sometimes I just say, hey, this is all the cool stuff we offer.
[00:35:49] You should look at us if you're ever thinking about making a switch, give us a call.
[00:35:52] You know, and I did that for 13 years for almost 14 years with very limited success, right?
[00:35:58] Because what I took me a long time to figure this out. And this is probably what we all know anyway,
[00:36:03] people don't really like to be sold or at least not have there are people that do like to be sold.
[00:36:07] But they're in the vast minority, I think of the public. The other, you know, the vast majority of
[00:36:12] people want to be heard and seen and felt like, you know, they're cared about. So how do you
[00:36:18] demonstrate that in a reach out? Well, Nick just gave you a whole bunch of reasons.
[00:36:23] Know what's going on in their life. Reach out to them, comment on their posts, you know,
[00:36:27] send them a video and ask them how their kids are doing or how, you know, ex in their business
[00:36:32] or their life is doing. But what I started doing for recruiting and a Nick, I want to get your
[00:36:37] impression of this is now I send a basically a two sentence email, even if it's somebody I've never
[00:36:45] talked to before. And usually I'll know that I'll know something about them. So I'll say, hey,
[00:36:50] I noticed you, you're up 300% this year. Like that's incredible in this market. Just curious,
[00:36:56] how are you doing that? I'd love to find out more about you. And I have got so many responses.
[00:37:03] I went from a point one response. Now these are cold emails. They don't know me. They're not in my
[00:37:07] sphere. I would get a point one response. So very, very few. I'm getting a point five response
[00:37:13] now, which doesn't sound like much. It's still half of 1%. But I can send out lots of these messages
[00:37:19] in a, I can't really scale it very easily. But I can send these out very quickly. It shows that I
[00:37:25] know something about them. And it's asking them to engage. I'm going, I might say like, wow,
[00:37:30] that's really amazing. How do you do that? It's kind of what we do on the show, right? So I'm
[00:37:35] curious to Nick, if you receive, because you get recruited, you're a big, a big producer in Detroit.
[00:37:41] What kind of recruiting messages do you get to set a curiosity?
[00:37:45] Yeah, I mean, I actually haven't really seen that. It's usually the, you know, a couple
[00:37:50] paragraphs long. Here's what we offer. Yeah. And it's the catchy, the catchy subject line that
[00:37:56] you get every single time. So it's a pretty quick, you know, see and delete situation.
[00:38:02] But yeah, I mean, I really like that. I think that's good. Everybody wants to talk about
[00:38:06] themselves and what they're doing and what's working. Everybody's pretty quick to do that, right?
[00:38:10] So it gives people the opportunity to talk about themselves and, and, and, you know, who knows how long
[00:38:17] who who knows how long ago they were able to do that, but people do like to speak on themselves and
[00:38:22] what they're doing and what's going on in their life. So give them an opportunity to do it.
[00:38:26] And by the way, I want to mention how Nick got in contact with us. He reached out. He is doing exactly
[00:38:31] what he did to us is exactly what he does with his clients, which he's he reached out. He said,
[00:38:37] Hey, I really like your show. I've been a listener for for a long time. I've listened to it's like
[00:38:41] over 200 episodes, which I haven't even listened to 200 episodes of my own show. But I appreciate that
[00:38:46] you did. And you said, it's really made an impact on me. And I'd like to tell you about what impact
[00:38:50] it's made. He sent this to me in an Instagram drug message. And it's not like I don't get those
[00:38:56] every single day of the year. I probably get one or two of those a week at best and we have lots
[00:39:02] of listeners, ravaging 12,000 downloads a day. So there's lots of people listening. But Nick went
[00:39:06] out of his way to say, here's what your show means to me. And I really appreciate you doing what
[00:39:10] you do. And he didn't say, I want to be a guest. How do you have me on? He just said, Hey, this means
[00:39:15] a lot to me. Thank you. And I was like, Oh, I definitely want to have this guy on. And you know,
[00:39:20] because number one, he's super flattering. And you know, a a a turn of phrase can always catch my eye.
[00:39:25] But also he told me about the reason I do this show is to make an impact to have help people. And
[00:39:32] and I'm just asking the question. So it's really our guests like Nick that are actually doing the
[00:39:36] heavy lifting. But I'm glad that it has an impact. And I'm grateful to Nick for saying, Hey,
[00:39:41] thank you for doing this because I just I you know, getting a thank you is always appreciated. And
[00:39:47] it just so happened. You were talking about for two at his timing. Nick did that and it
[00:39:51] the exact moment in my we were planning our first webinar. And I said, I need somebody to be
[00:39:58] coached. And I go, Oh, this is the guy. I mean, it was like 10 minutes before I was like, I got to
[00:40:03] get somebody to be coached. I have all these listeners. I don't want to have to do an announcement
[00:40:07] and say, I want to be coached and everyone's going to, you know, and then I'm going to have to filter
[00:40:11] through it. And then this bad hit my inbox out of nowhere. And things like that happen. And then
[00:40:16] a week later, you know, two weeks later, Nick was on the show. And now he's being interviewed. So
[00:40:21] things like this, these things do have impact. You know, and again, this isn't Nick's doing us a
[00:40:26] favor. So this isn't really helping Nick as a business owner. But it's helping me and my podcasts.
[00:40:31] And I'm grateful that it helps him as well. So just wanted to just share that story because
[00:40:37] those things happen, you know, reach out and stay in touch with the people that that means something
[00:40:42] to you. Okay, so then let's talk about direct messages. So we're now back to, you know, you're
[00:40:46] sending videos. You're following three people a day. You're commenting on there on posts. And
[00:40:52] what do you send in a direct message? Yeah. So I think number one, the lowest hanging fruit when it
[00:40:57] comes to sending a message is Facebook because Facebook every single day gives you a list of who's
[00:41:01] birthdays it, right? Whoever's birthday is today. And you know, if you have north of 500
[00:41:09] friends that you're, you know, that you're following or that you're friends with on Facebook,
[00:41:12] I can guarantee it's at least someone's birthday today, right? So that's kind of lowest hanging
[00:41:16] fruit. And what I do there, again, it's the personal, it's the personalized message, right? So
[00:41:20] rather than just posting on our wall, like potentially hundreds of people are going to do,
[00:41:24] send them a direct message or send them a text message. But in terms of social media platforms,
[00:41:29] send them the direct message or whatever, you know, whatever personal spend you want to put on it,
[00:41:34] that's a good one to do. And then very similar, like if it's not a birthday, again, it could be,
[00:41:38] you know, let's say you've made it through your three comments. And you're looking for another reason
[00:41:43] to reach out to someone else. So it could be a story or it could be a feed post that they posted on.
[00:41:50] And again, they went on vacation, they just got married, they just had a baby or the kid just,
[00:41:54] you know, scored the winning goal in their soccer game or whatever it might be. You know, it's a
[00:41:59] reason to reach out and again, just send a personal message. And again, it helps the algorithm.
[00:42:03] So you're staying on top of mind and being in front of people.
[00:42:07] Love it. Now I want to quickly just ask about your content that you post that is, you know, on
[00:42:14] social media. So how often are you doing it and what types of content are you posting? Because we
[00:42:20] talked about how you're interacting with followers and friends. But what are you actually posting if
[00:42:24] anything? Yeah. Yeah. So I utilize, I utilize two platforms regularly, Facebook and Instagram.
[00:42:31] Those are kind of my two. Those are those are where I'm at. I really like Instagram. I just like
[00:42:35] the platform of it. But also it's easy for me to use. And that's where I have most of my interaction.
[00:42:40] So what I'm doing is I'm trying to put up anywhere from three to five stories a day. And those are
[00:42:47] just days in a life, right? That's if I'm on a showing or if I'm on a listing appointment, I just
[00:42:50] say if I have a listing coming soon or you know, you're out of showing and you see something funny.
[00:42:56] Like use that opportunity to post and put it on a story. I use my feed. I'm usually posting at
[00:43:02] least once, if not twice a day on my feed on Instagram and on Facebook. I do utilize just listed
[00:43:11] just sold, right? And for nothing else, but to stay top of mind to let people know, hey, I'm doing
[00:43:16] business. And again, it's it goes back to that scenario where you know, I'm at a wedding.
[00:43:20] Haven't talked to somebody in 10 years and we've been friends on Facebook and all the sudden,
[00:43:24] hey, you know, Nick, it looks like you're doing great with real estate, right? Don't people are
[00:43:28] going to see it, right? So, but I also try to do more value ad post as well. So, you know, I do a lot
[00:43:36] for the I have been starting to post more for the agent community, like best tips and tricks and
[00:43:42] what I'm doing that's working. And so I'm doing a lot of that like real, reals in the for on
[00:43:47] Instagram, where that has become a big piece of my real estate content or my Instagram content is
[00:43:53] actually geared towards real estate agents and helping them. So again, it for a real estate agent,
[00:43:58] it's just top of mind post what you're doing. Do the things you're doing. If you're brand new,
[00:44:02] one of the things that I started with anytime you're going to a show. Or even if you don't have
[00:44:07] a showing schedule, right? Like for the brand new real estate agent, and I say this all the time,
[00:44:11] the brand new real estate agent doesn't have any clients, you're going out and you're probably
[00:44:15] practicing getting into into into houses by opening up lock boxes and just going to see homes and
[00:44:19] doing some self teaching of like, okay, how would I orchestrate the showing or, you know, whatever
[00:44:24] I might be use those opportunities pull out your phone and video tape yourself opening the door
[00:44:29] or, you know, walking through the home and it's a really nice kitchen or it's a really nice bathroom
[00:44:33] or you see something funny or something even something that's a little bit ugly, right? I mean,
[00:44:37] post about it. It shows people that you're in the industry. It shows people that you're active,
[00:44:42] that you're doing things. One of the biggest things that I see most people that fall short on is
[00:44:48] they're posting things outside of the industry other than their personal life and family, right?
[00:44:55] So for instance, like, you know, if you're if for me it's you're working out in the morning and
[00:45:00] I can't tell whether you're whether you're target audience is someone that you're trying to
[00:45:05] become a personal trainer for because you're recording all of your workouts and putting them online
[00:45:08] or are you trying to push your content out to let people know that hey, I'm a real estate agent.
[00:45:13] Like be really clear on what your message is and what you want to be known for and a lot of
[00:45:17] those lines, I mean, for my for my personal page on Facebook and Instagram, I do tend to be about
[00:45:24] 60 to 70% business and 30 to 40% personal. I do like a mix of both, but I definitely want that
[00:45:30] business opportunity to let people know that hey, this is what I'm doing.
[00:45:34] So on your business page, when it comes to video, you're probably not posting, hey,
[00:45:39] just finished a tough workout. That would go more on your personal page. So I actually so I just
[00:45:44] have one page. So my personal is my business and my business. So you'll got so the vast majority
[00:45:49] of your content is going to be business. You said about a 70 30 split and then you're also posting
[00:45:54] here's day in the life. Here's what else I do outside of that. And if we really think about
[00:45:59] this strategy. So let's talk. Let's think about what Nick's doing from a much larger. And by the way,
[00:46:05] I won't actually before I get to that, when I talk about Nick mentioning something and we just quickly
[00:46:09] breeze past it, I want to back up. He's posting content for other REALTORS. Now let's think about why
[00:46:14] Nick might be doing that or what's the benefit other than Nick being a wonderful guy and giving away
[00:46:19] some value to the audience. Yes, what might come his way as a result? Well, a person is doing 103
[00:46:26] deals a year. Probably need some help at some point. He is going to hit his maximum number of hours
[00:46:31] and he is going to need a team maybe or he's going to say, nope, I'm just going to stay myself. But
[00:46:37] having options is a good thing. And so Nick is showing the community. Here's what I do. I can show
[00:46:43] you how to do this or here's some free tips. And guess what people are going to do with Nick. They're
[00:46:47] going to reach out and say, I want to talk to you. I want to I want to join forces with you. And Nick
[00:46:51] also works for a company that has this really cool referral system where you can have people
[00:46:55] kind of working with you. And so this is a very, very wise, wise strategy for anybody who's looking
[00:47:02] to build their team at track more ages. I should be doing this for recruiting agents. So this
[00:47:09] that is a really, really smart strategy. And also at the very least, even if it never attracts
[00:47:14] another agent, you're helping people, which is incredible. Right. So Nick's doing all of those things.
[00:47:21] And yeah, so incredible stuff there. Yeah, I would say one more thing. One benefit of that too
[00:47:26] is it gets you recognized by other agents in your market. Right. So they feel like they know you.
[00:47:31] Exactly. Exactly. And if they see that, hey, this is someone who is well educated, well knowledgeable,
[00:47:36] closing a lot of deals. Guess what? When your offer shows up in their inbox, you have some form of
[00:47:41] familiarity, whether they've worked it through or not. And I mean, at this day and age, everybody,
[00:47:45] I mean, if we're going out to a restaurant, right? If we're going to go to a restaurant, the first
[00:47:48] thing most people do, it's not asking a friend. It's going to reviews and it's going to their
[00:47:54] social media page to see what does the menu look like? What does the atmosphere feel like? So I mean,
[00:47:59] even in that, right? I mean, it's it forms the educational background of saying, okay, Nick's
[00:48:04] offer just ended up in my inbox. He's working with a client. Like, is this someone because listing
[00:48:09] agents as you should, you're doing your due diligence on not only the buyer, but also the agent to
[00:48:13] make sure that the agent's closed. And so it helps with that as well. I love that. So you're
[00:48:18] really hitting gosh, all sides from a marketing perspective, I that's my background and I'm
[00:48:25] beyond impressed with this. I want to talk about now, let's move over to your past clients, your
[00:48:30] repeat business. So we're moving away from sort of the finding, attracting new business while
[00:48:37] you're still we're still talking about that. But what are we doing to maintain and deepen the
[00:48:41] relationships of those that we've worked with before? Yeah, so with with past clients, I mean,
[00:48:47] your past client campaign, if you will, your past client campaign is super important whether whether
[00:48:52] that's organized through a your CRM, I use follow up boss. So whether it's organized through that,
[00:48:58] you're giving tags to know when to reach out, whether it's the video text messages because those
[00:49:02] past clients become ice here of influence in their in my context. So I'm talking to them at least
[00:49:06] four times a year. What I also recommend for past clients, I do something that's very, very simple.
[00:49:12] At the beginning of the year, and if you haven't yet, do it now, I would print off a one page sheet
[00:49:17] of paper that shows all 12 months. And the goal is to have something in every single month a reason
[00:49:23] to reach out. So whether you're doing client events. So for me, you know, I do three client events
[00:49:28] for my past clients, my closed clients who are my clients, I don't I don't necessarily love
[00:49:33] client and past clients because they're still your clients. So three client events a year,
[00:49:38] winter, fall, and then a summer. And then some additional touch points like maybe you do,
[00:49:44] this is one that I capitalize on is my team runs what we call a CMA week and we make it fun
[00:49:48] within our team. It's a competitive atmosphere and there's, you know, there's rewards or prizes
[00:49:52] for the team that wins or the individual that wins. But three times a year, I'm going to reach out
[00:49:56] to all of my past clients or people within my sphere of influence and tell them the benefit of,
[00:50:01] you know, most people are always interested in the value of their home, right? And most people go
[00:50:04] to different sites and like everyone wants to know, what is their equity stake in their home?
[00:50:09] Of course, I just I just got my Zillow report today. And by the way, whether we agree or disagree
[00:50:14] that Zillow's accurate, I jump on that email, even though I could, well, I'd hope I could at least do
[00:50:20] it as good of a job running a CMA on myself. I don't run a CMA on myself, but guess what Zillow does
[00:50:26] every month for me. And I got that email and I jumped, it was actually down 0.1% and I actually got
[00:50:31] a little upset. But honestly, that's kind of I'm not selling. It's kind of a silly thing. I shouldn't
[00:50:36] really be paying attention. It's like looking at your weight every single day. It's probably not a
[00:50:39] great idea because of weights fluctuate like price, home prices, month to month or day to day. But
[00:50:45] everybody wants to know. So I love that you do that. Yeah. So CMA week, right? And another benefit of
[00:50:50] that is if you have somebody who purchased a home and did not put 20% down, they have private
[00:50:56] mortgage insurance, right? And so if they purchased a home two years ago, but they might have a
[00:51:00] position now to where they have enough equity to save them that $100 a month or whatever their
[00:51:04] private mortgage insurance is now you're actually giving them something of value. It's not just a
[00:51:08] home value estimate. You're also saying, Hey, this could be something you could take to your lender
[00:51:13] and wave your PMI and it could save you $100 to $200 a month, right? So I do three client events.
[00:51:18] I do three CMA weeks and my team does three CMA weeks. So that covers half of the year. That's six
[00:51:23] touch points. I also do three what I call beyond real estate weeks. So I pick three different
[00:51:29] months and it's something not real estate related, right? It's for me around Thanksgiving and around
[00:51:34] the Christmas time around Christmas time. I'll do a pie drop off or how people come and pick up ice.
[00:51:39] So just something again, personal doesn't have to do with real estate. Just say thank you.
[00:51:43] Wanted to give this to you and your family. And again, figure out what that is for you. Something
[00:51:49] beyond real estate. So that takes up nine of the 12 and then the other three what I personally do
[00:51:54] in Michigan are whether it's very seasonal. So I generally send out three times a year in
[00:51:59] preparation of the winter and preparation of summer and then going back into the winter. I'll send
[00:52:03] or I'm sorry, so going into the winter so like sometime in the fall and then in the spring
[00:52:08] heading into the summer and then the spring heading into the fall heading into the winter.
[00:52:13] I send out a checklist of different things. You know, what might just be as simple as
[00:52:17] make sure you're changing your furnace filters and make sure that you're changing your
[00:52:20] smoke detector batteries. For us again, there's things where in the winter is if you're going to go
[00:52:24] on vacation for a week and we're expecting, you know, but freezing weather, you do not want to
[00:52:30] have your temperature set lower than about 65 degrees in your home or your pipes could freeze.
[00:52:33] So it's just little things like that where, you know, home maintenance tips,
[00:52:38] tips and tricks and here's what to expect. And again, it's just giving something a value but also
[00:52:42] being relevant and staying top of mind. So each month and thank you for that tip. Each month you
[00:52:48] have some sort of touch point. You mentioned it could be the four video calls. It could be the
[00:52:54] client appreciation events. It could be the seasonal. Hey, get ready for this season. It could be the
[00:53:00] non real estate related things that you're doing. And but I didn't hear is what I didn't hear
[00:53:08] is newsletter. Are you an email newsletter guy? I am not. I am not. Interesting. So you're the first
[00:53:15] person I've talked to that is not now. Why are you not doing email newsletter? So for me,
[00:53:21] personally, it becomes one of those things where number one, it can become repetitive and we're kind
[00:53:28] of fluffing it up. And so for me is I want to give tax full outreaches with actual value. And I
[00:53:38] want it to be personal, not something that they feel like is being spread out throughout 200 different
[00:53:43] people. Right. So for me, that I mean, it's just a personal preference. It's something that I
[00:53:47] haven't done for that reason. And that's really the only reason why. I wrote an article for a real
[00:53:53] estate magazine once in the title. We'll tell you my opinion, which was nobody wants to read your
[00:53:58] real estate newsletter. So that was my opinion. But regardless of whether people want to read a real
[00:54:04] estate newsletter or not, by the way, I get about a hundred of these from agents, which I've never
[00:54:08] signed up for. By the never once sign up for real estate newsletter. And these are not my
[00:54:13] past REALTORS that help me buy and sell properties. These are just other REALTORS who are like,
[00:54:18] hey, he's on my contact list, he's getting my newsletter. And you know, it's fine. It's nice. It's
[00:54:22] whatever. I've never read one of them, not one. And maybe I'm different. Maybe your clients,
[00:54:27] everybody's clients love to read that. I don't know. But certainly I don't read them. And again,
[00:54:33] it's also what everyone else is already doing. So you don't need to set out a real estate newsletter.
[00:54:38] You're the person sitting next to you probably is. But I love that I love that you're not doing that
[00:54:42] because that is a very common strategy that agents do. And then they think, well, I'm touching my
[00:54:47] clients once a month with this newsletter. And yeah, technically you are. But maybe there's a way
[00:54:52] that you could do that more effectively. And more like you said, you know, more strict or
[00:54:59] yeah, more strategically, right? You're really thinking about how do I actually provide value?
[00:55:03] Not just like, and by the way, again, this goes back to my recruiting. I used to just say,
[00:55:07] here's all the cool stuff I'm up to. Here's all the cool stuff our firm's doing. And nobody really
[00:55:11] cared that much. As much as I thought it was cool. And I went, oh, yeah, because every firm says
[00:55:16] that every firm says they're the greatest support technology and training everybody says it. So
[00:55:21] it's not all that differentiated. It's more about getting a personalized, some personalized attention.
[00:55:26] Okay. Now I want to switch to so by the way, that takes care of your repeat clients because they're
[00:55:31] and again, again, repeat clients is ongoing. Clients is really the phrase, you were touching them
[00:55:37] in some way and in different ways every single month. And so they're getting a lot of contact with
[00:55:43] you and your business, but in really fun and engaging ways. So I love that. And now let's get into
[00:55:51] circle prospecting. For those of us that don't know what circle prospecting is, could you explain that?
[00:55:56] Yeah. So circle prospecting the way that I kind of capitalize on it and the way that I,
[00:56:01] the way that I kind of explain it is that it's outbound prospecting. And I use it around
[00:56:07] a couple of different scenarios, but it's it's pulling local homeowners contact information.
[00:56:11] You have their address, you have their phone number, sometimes, you know, some platforms offer
[00:56:14] the email as well. I like the cold outreach of a phone call. And so you're getting in contact with
[00:56:20] homeowners and giving them a call based on, you know, a handful of different reasons. So what I do
[00:56:26] is I have a couple of different strategies that I use or reasons to call. So number one, and one
[00:56:31] that a lot of people don't think about is around buyers. Number one is if you, if you have a buyer,
[00:56:37] who is looking in a specific neighborhood, it's a really good reason to call. It's a more of like
[00:56:41] a geographic for me. You call around for your buyer in a specific neighborhood or within a specific
[00:56:46] school district. And it's having conversations with those homeowners saying I have an active buyer
[00:56:51] looking to move in to a home within the next couple of months. Curious if you've had any thought of
[00:56:55] potentially making a move or selling your home. If you got a price that made sense, even if it was
[00:56:59] off market, right? I love that piece of it because a lot of people, the guard kind of comes down and
[00:57:03] it's like, well, I don't want to get my home ready. I don't want to have a ton of people come into the
[00:57:06] home and what happens if someone steals something and all of the things that happen with that. So buyers
[00:57:11] that are looking in specific areas, the other reason I use it around my buyers is let's say they put
[00:57:16] it in an offer on a home and maybe the offer didn't get accepted. Well, I now know that that neighborhood
[00:57:21] is something that they're looking for. So why wouldn't I capitalize on that opportunity to call
[00:57:26] those local homeowners in the neighborhood and say, hey, my buyer just made an offer on a home
[00:57:29] that was for sale in your neighborhood. Unfortunately, we got beat out. I'm curious if you happen to have
[00:57:33] an insane conversation. I'm curious if you happen to have any thought of selling. If you got a price
[00:57:37] that made sense, I'm working with someone actively making offers and looking to move into the area.
[00:57:41] The other time that I use it for my buyers is if I have gone under contract or closed on a home
[00:57:46] because it's a really good opportunity. And same thing could be said if you're on a team or you're
[00:57:49] in an office and someone had a buyer going under contract in an area that you would want to work
[00:57:54] or service might as well use that as an opportunity as well to pick up potential listings. So that's
[00:58:03] why I'm curious. I use it on multiple occasions, but when I have a home that I'm going to be putting
[00:58:06] on the market, I usually call it four different times when we're in coming soon status or the week
[00:58:11] before going live, the week or the day we go live, that week we go live, the week we go pending and
[00:58:15] the week that it actually closes and is sold. Every call is a little bit different, right? The first
[00:58:21] two calls in coming soon and active, I'm looking for a buyer, but I'm also getting my name out there
[00:58:26] to the local neighbors to say, hey, I'm a real estate agent actively listing a home in your neighborhood.
[00:58:30] I want them to know that Nick Harris is getting ready to list a home in their neighborhood. So
[00:58:36] that's where that piece of it comes in. It's the coming soon and the active. And then once we go
[00:58:40] pending and once we sell, I now have actual information to give to them. I can tell them, hey,
[00:58:46] we listed at X price and we had this many showing, we got this many offers and it ended up going
[00:58:50] under contract price, right? You have actual information and market data to present to them
[00:58:56] and in a great scenario, right? Where let's say you did end up getting multiple offers,
[00:59:00] you have five offers, you can only take one. So that means there's four buyers that are still out
[00:59:05] there. And if you can go to a homeowner and say, hey, we ended up getting five offers. So there's
[00:59:09] still four buyers that are actively looking in this neighborhood. I'm just curious if you happen
[00:59:12] if you happen to have any thought of making a move or selling your home, if you got a person that
[00:59:16] will hold. I'm pausing because my jaw is dropping. So you, I'm not even, I've done this for seven
[00:59:22] years. I've never, never heard of anybody doing this. So we are talking about you are contacting.
[00:59:28] These are cold calls. These are the coldest of cold calls. These are people that do not know you,
[00:59:34] do, do not know whether they even like or trust you. You are saying, hey, I'm, first of all,
[00:59:39] I'm listing a home in this area. Hate, by the way, I just went pending as the second call. Third
[00:59:43] and the fourth would be, hey, here's what just happened. And we had a lot of showings. We had a lot
[00:59:48] of offers. And I was curious. And here's what happened. Would you be curious in participating in this
[00:59:54] in some way? That is unbelievable. That is amazing. What are the, what are the responses when you make
[01:00:02] these calls? Yeah. So you're, you know, you're going to get a mix of everything, right? I mean,
[01:00:06] you can kind of go up both ends of the spectrum. You're going to have the person that says, yes,
[01:00:09] I've actually been thinking about it. We love to have you over today. And then you're going to have
[01:00:12] the people who can't hang up on you fast enough. Right. So, and then anything in between, you know,
[01:00:18] it's all about having those tactful conversations. And these are the conversations that I have with
[01:00:22] the agents that I, that I help coach and mentor, if you will, and that reach out to me. And these are
[01:00:27] the conversations that I have with them about how to best script and put into, put into words to keep
[01:00:34] a conversation going, right? Because if someone shows, if they're not quick to get you off the phone,
[01:00:38] they have some interest at some, some level, right? There's some interest, even if it's just knowing
[01:00:42] the value of their home. So how can you continue that conversation to, again, be top of mind,
[01:00:47] when they do think about it, but also get in front of them, whether it's a home estimate or just
[01:00:51] to give them data, even if it's just to get their email. Now they're in your database. You have a
[01:00:55] name, a number you haven't addressed, and you have an email. Now they're in your database. And
[01:00:59] next time a home cell is you're sending them an update of, hey, another home just sold in your
[01:01:02] neighborhood. Here's what it's sold for. Right. So, you know, you have, you have a, you have a wide
[01:01:07] variety of different conversations that can take place anywhere on that spectrum. It's either, hey,
[01:01:11] come, you know, ready to go, come list me. It could be a get off the phone, never call me again,
[01:01:15] or it could be anything in the middle where you're just trying to pull out as much information as you
[01:01:19] can. And it might be leaving voice mails that never get returned. Exactly. That probably happens to.
[01:01:25] And again, Nick's not trying to make a sale. He is presenting something that may be of interest
[01:01:34] to the person he's calling, right? He's not selling anything. He's not saying, hey, I want to list
[01:01:40] your property. Everybody wants to list everybody's property. Of course, he's saying, hey, this is a thing
[01:01:44] that happened that's relevant to you. And by the way, you know, we know everyone, every neighbor's
[01:01:50] nosy, you talk about open houses. I forgot that was one of the calls. So, open house, that was,
[01:01:55] did I get that right? Yeah. So, like, if you're in, if you're in a two-in-one, soon status,
[01:01:59] they're getting ready to go live and you're planning on having an open house, the opening weekend,
[01:02:03] or the second weekend, it's a good opportunity to invite those neighbors to the open house and how
[01:02:07] they get to experience what it is that you do at an open house as well. And to get to see what the
[01:02:11] inside of their neighbor's home looks like, which is also something they're very interested in.
[01:02:15] That's most often what people are interested in. Of course. And it gives you an opportunity to get
[01:02:20] them signed in and now you have their email address. Exactly. I mean, this, Nick, I, I have to say,
[01:02:25] I'm absolutely floored by the tightness of this and you're willingness to do very difficult things.
[01:02:34] It is not a lot of fun to pick up the phone and call somebody who's a homeowner who really
[01:02:39] doesn't want the phone call and then be able to have a nice conversation. Yes, it happens.
[01:02:44] And that's great. And you also get a lot of hang-ups, probably some unkind messages as well,
[01:02:51] unkind interactions. And it's worth still worth doing. It's kind of like doing push-ups in the gym
[01:02:58] and until you collapse, which I, by the way, I, or rather, I'll give a different one. If anyone
[01:03:04] wants to see a really brutal exercise, there's a lot of them. Look up eccentric pull-ups, which I
[01:03:09] was doing yesterday. Those are no fun. And those, those, you pull yourself up one and then slowly go
[01:03:16] down seven seconds. That's the way we do it. And it's not like I can do a dozen push-ups. I can't,
[01:03:20] or pull-ups. I can do about seven at my best. And those are critical because they really help build
[01:03:28] the muscle faster and they're no fun at all and they hurt and you want to cry afterwards.
[01:03:33] So, but that's why they're worth doing. So I always think, you know, life is about in my opinion,
[01:03:41] or rather the most, the most fulfillment, I think, in life comes from doing really hard things
[01:03:48] that are good for you. And calling everybody in a neighborhood to let them know about this
[01:03:53] property is good for them and it's good for you. So it's actually a win-win, even if they tell
[01:03:59] you to buzz off. Okay, great. Moving on to the next house. That is unbelievably. I cannot tell you.
[01:04:05] I can say to me that the benefit of that arm of my business and that pillar of building leads is
[01:04:10] that you're not only working with sellers, number one, because they actively own the home. But it's
[01:04:15] also potential for two deals, right? Because they need to go and buy a new home. They may, you know,
[01:04:20] they may have the opportunity for they're going to live with family, they're going to rent. But more
[01:04:23] often than not, you know, I was from my experience, over 50% of the time, they're either looking to move
[01:04:29] somewhere locally, whether it's downsize or upsize, or they're looking to move out of state. And so
[01:04:34] it's a referral for you as well. Yeah, it's a no-brainer. But it requires doing those pull-ups that are
[01:04:41] no fun. But it doesn't need to be fun. It just needs to be effective and it needs to be good for the
[01:04:46] other person. And this, these kind of quote, you know, I live in a condo building. We only have 45
[01:04:51] units. We don't have hundreds and hundreds of units. So with somebody wants to live in our building,
[01:04:55] there's limited inventory. There's usually only one place for sale at best at any given time.
[01:05:00] Nobody has ever called me and said, and by the way, we have tears. So like, if I'm, you know,
[01:05:05] my particular unit's the same of, you know, seven other tears. And I've never gotten one phone call.
[01:05:11] Never got one postcard. Never received one letter saying, hey, I just sold so and so's place. I have,
[01:05:17] we got a lot of people interested. Would you be interested in having a conversation? Because I
[01:05:22] want to love to connect you with these, these buyers. Not one. And I don't think it's because everyone
[01:05:27] knows I'm an agent because I don't even practice real estate. So you could definitely prospect. And
[01:05:33] amazing. So I'm sure if Nick was here in Chicago, I, and he sold something in my building, I would
[01:05:39] get a call from him. So that's, that's incredible. So we're talking about neighborhood dialing. Again,
[01:05:45] you're willing to do a lot of things that, and again, I suspect this comes back to your excellent
[01:05:52] strengths in sports, you know, you, you were a college athlete. And in order to rise to that level,
[01:05:58] you just had to work a lot harder than most people, right? You had to put in the time that most
[01:06:02] weren't willing to do that as a personal trainer. You have to keep your body in an incredible shape,
[01:06:07] also to be an athlete too. I imagine that discipline really serves you in your business now.
[01:06:14] Yeah, absolutely. I think it's played a huge role. And again, it's for me, it's, it's having similar
[01:06:19] to that athletic background. It's having a game plan in motion. And then it's just acting on it,
[01:06:23] right? A lot of people just don't know what to do. Or what their daily schedule should look like. And
[01:06:27] my, my calendars filled out for every, I mean, I have something blocked off every moment of my working
[01:06:33] day, where I have a task that I'm going to be doing from the moment I start to the moment I'm done.
[01:06:39] And then when I'm done, I'm clocked out on with my family, I'm with my daughter and my wife. And,
[01:06:45] everything that I do is again, it's just having knowing what to do and then actually implementing it.
[01:06:50] I think that knowing what to do is the easy part, whether it's talking to different people or
[01:06:54] finding a mentor or even just reaching out to me, like helping with those things is the actual
[01:06:59] implementation and putting it into your calendar that a lot of people just, they can't do.
[01:07:04] Yeah, we're talking about, you know, intentionally creating the day that you think is most
[01:07:11] effective for you. And instead of being reactionary, right, we all have things flying at us, emails,
[01:07:18] client-appointing, client phone calls, problems, every, you know, every transaction has a problem at
[01:07:23] some point. So you have, you're going to have plenty to do today, whether you plan your day or not.
[01:07:28] But, you know, what at what cost, right? Does it come at the cost of time with your daughter or your
[01:07:34] wife, right? If you don't have time plan to handle not only what's coming in, but also how to
[01:07:41] keep the business running, meaning how am I growing my business every single day, not just reacting
[01:07:46] to my business, you're going to be not only less efficient, but you're going to have a lot more
[01:07:53] stress in your life. You know, you're going to be waiting for things to happen. Nick doesn't wait
[01:07:58] for things to happen. He just does the things that he knows are going to ultimately get him results
[01:08:03] and he makes modifications along the way. I'm sure there's been things you've tried that you're
[01:08:08] like, that just doesn't work for me. And I'm going to try something else. Is that happened where
[01:08:12] you've tried various, you know, I always think people who are the most successful fail the most,
[01:08:17] and they did just the failures don't get really talked about. But can you share with us one of your
[01:08:21] one of your failures just so that everybody can feel like you're a human being. You have issues
[01:08:27] just like everybody else. Yeah, I mean, there's definitely, you know, there's things that I've tried
[01:08:30] that just haven't worked. I can't necessarily think of anything off the top of my head, but there's
[01:08:34] absolutely things that I've tried and just don't end up working. I think where actually most people
[01:08:38] fall short is not doing things long enough, not giving it enough time to actually produce fruit.
[01:08:45] Right. I mean, it's everybody you can hear like stick to a couple of different things. It's the
[01:08:50] same thing with social media like master one. Don't try to be on all platforms doing everything.
[01:08:54] Stick with one. Do it really well. And then maybe once you've mastered it, you can move into a
[01:08:58] second, you know, a second form. But anything that anything, you know, work doing today needs to
[01:09:03] be worth doing for a decade. And it's about sticking to it long enough to actually see the fruit of
[01:09:10] it. You know, most people are, and this is a real estate is very cyclical, right? I mean, you,
[01:09:15] the the client that you're working with today and even the contract that you signed today, if you're
[01:09:20] working with a buyer, that's not closing in, you know, in most cases throughout the US, it's not
[01:09:24] closing for a month, if not two months from now. So even the work that you're putting in today,
[01:09:28] doesn't bear fruit for at least another month or two. And at the same thing can go with generating
[01:09:32] leads, prospecting, and whatever you're doing, working on your business and in your business,
[01:09:36] it's not going to have, you know, it's not going to have a payout today. Do it long enough to give
[01:09:42] it time. And so generally, my recommendation is if if you can stick with something for about six
[01:09:46] months, do it for six months, if you're absolutely seeing nothing from that, then you have two options.
[01:09:51] It's either the platform or whatever you're doing is not working or you need to change the way
[01:09:55] you're doing it. Yeah, it's funny. I, I'm going through a version of this myself. So I created this
[01:10:01] new marketing campaign. I'm doing videos to recruit agents. I talked about how I'm changing up my
[01:10:07] emails. And we have now seen a 74 and a half percent increase in traffic to our recruiting website,
[01:10:14] which is amazing, except I'm not seeing a lot of conversions into people who are really interested
[01:10:21] in reaching out. So now I have to go, okay, I know how to drive traffic to the website through
[01:10:27] the content I create. Now I need to figure out which, you know, when people build things too,
[01:10:33] they get really emotionally invested in them, whether it's, you know, an ad you put out,
[01:10:37] whether it's a brochure, whether it's a technique you try, you get emotionally connected to it.
[01:10:42] And I got emotionally, I get emotionally connected to the website I built because it's beautiful.
[01:10:45] I think it works perfectly. It's just the best looking, you know, recruiting
[01:10:49] REALTOR website that I've ever seen and I'm very proud of it. Yes, it's not converting.
[01:10:55] So I have to now eat a little bit of humble pie and go, okay, now I need to figure out how to get
[01:11:01] people to take action. And even though aesthetically, I think it looks perfect, there's something I'm
[01:11:07] missing. There's something it's not quite hitting. And now I have to figure that out. But the reality
[01:11:12] of it is, is I just, I also have to keep driving traffic there. So we're talking about refinement.
[01:11:17] And Nick is really an unbelievable refiner. He knows all of his numbers. When you go back and
[01:11:22] listen to his coaching session, you will find out he knows exactly what converts. He knows how much
[01:11:27] time to put in. And as a result of all of knowing his numbers, we talk about knowing your numbers in
[01:11:32] the market. But knowing your numbers in your business really helps you figure out how to plan your day.
[01:11:37] I mean, that tells you, okay, I have to put certain amount of money in, you know, I'm sorry,
[01:11:41] I started to put certain amount of time in this bucket, this bucket, in this bucket. Why only
[01:11:45] have, you know, X number of hours in the day. Nick figures that out ahead of time. And then he just
[01:11:50] sticks to his bucket, sticks to his time block it. From an accountability perspective, we didn't
[01:11:55] talk about that. I just wanted to maybe end with this. Do you have an accountability partner? Do
[01:11:59] you have a coach? How are you staying? Because, you know, obviously, you're a super self-discipline guy.
[01:12:05] I'm sure accountability, you had a coach as an athlete, you know, what is your sort of
[01:12:10] processor on getting coached? Yeah, so I do have a coach within my organization and within my team.
[01:12:18] And one of the nice things about the organization that I'm with, again, that coach is financially
[01:12:22] incentivized for me to do well with better he does, right? But in addition to that, you know,
[01:12:28] it's I do have a coach and I do have through that. And it's something that's, you know,
[01:12:35] that I take very seriously and having some type of mentor or some type of coach to help not only
[01:12:40] give you direction, but also track metrics, see what's working, what's not, give different
[01:12:45] alternatives and actually see what it is that you're doing, being held accountable to someone,
[01:12:49] whether it's a coach or a friend, whatever the case may be, someone who, someone who's,
[01:12:53] ideally, someone who's in a position that you want to be in is where we should be looking.
[01:12:58] And who's done what you want to do. That's where we should be looking. And so I highly recommend it.
[01:13:02] But yes, I do have a coach and someone who keeps me accountable to that. And for no other reason,
[01:13:07] then I find that we are, we are, we will let ourselves off the hook before we will disappoint someone else.
[01:13:18] Right? We will watch that extra hour of TV because we had a hard day. But if we had an appointment
[01:13:25] set with somebody, I bet we'd make it. I know I would. So for no other reason than
[01:13:32] getting yourself to do thing, this is embarrassing. I'll share this with people. I have a challenge
[01:13:37] waking up at the time that I want to wake up. I don't hit the snooze, but I just don't wake up.
[01:13:42] I wake up and then I go back to bed. And I've had this problem forever and I could beat myself
[01:13:46] up about it or I could find a solution. And I finally found a solution and I have somebody who
[01:13:51] is basically my assistant. She lives in a different part of the world. So she's at a different time
[01:13:57] than we are here. And it just so happens that the time I want to wake up is a really easy time
[01:14:02] for her to call me on WhatsApp and say it's time to wake up. Now, I'm not proud that I need to have
[01:14:07] somebody to help me wake up. It's a little embarrassing. I have a little judgment about that. But
[01:14:11] I don't care because it works because I will never let that phone ring for more than two rings.
[01:14:17] Because I am not going to have somebody halfway across the world calling me and just me not
[01:14:22] paying attention. That is even more embarrassing. That's humiliating. That's and it's not respectful of
[01:14:27] her time. It's not so I'll disrespect my own time all day long. I'm not going to disrespect
[01:14:32] someone else's. So if you struggle with procrastination or letting yourself off the hook, well,
[01:14:37] you're human. That makes you normal. Now, find solutions for that. Get someone else. Even if it's
[01:14:42] you got to have your spouse wake you up at 5 a.m. or whatever time. You know what?
[01:14:46] Doesn't matter. Everyone's everyone's human. So just a little just a little you know,
[01:14:51] inside into my life where people go, wow, you do so many things. You must, you know,
[01:14:55] you really have it all figured out. I'm like, not really. I just have systems. It's same with you.
[01:14:58] You have systems. You know what you're doing every day. So anyway, my head is spinning from all
[01:15:04] of the great stuff that Nick mentioned. I want to open this up to our audience to let them know that
[01:15:11] Nick is excited to connect with you as well. So Nick provides content for agents. He's also,
[01:15:17] you know, just leading by example. You could just see what he's doing on social media.
[01:15:22] And you could, you know, obviously see some of the great stuff he's doing and apply it to your own
[01:15:26] business. Nick, aside from Instagram, which everyone should follow Nick at Nick Harris underscore
[01:15:35] REALTOR. I'll have a link to that in the show notes. Nick, if anyone wants to shoot you an email
[01:15:39] or give you a call, what's the best way they should do that? Yeah, I would definitely say reach out to

[01:16:07] more regularly. So if this was impactful for you and boy, if it wasn't, I'm I'd have it all wrong

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.

Today, my guest is Nick Harris with eXp, with Best Life and Company Metro Detroit. Let me tell you more about Nick. Now, Nick Harris is a licensed REALTOR based in the Metro Detroit Michigan area with a passion for real estate that dates back to his college years. What began as a self-taught exploration of real estate, investing quickly turned into a thriving career. After starting his journey at United wholesale mortgage, Nick knew he was ready to make the leap to become a full-time REALTOR with just, this isn't, well, I'm going to get to the incredible part in a second. He basically got his license within two weeks, jumped in, on board, and this is what is really amazing. Since then, Nick has closed an impressive average. This is his average of 103 homes per year for the last three years. He does not have a team. It is just him. 103 homes per year for the last three years, building a reputation as a top performer in the area. But what truly sets him apart is his dedication to not only growing his business, but also mentoring fellow agents. Nick is passionate about helping other REALTOR's, build long-term success, showing them how to not only make a living, but to set themselves and their families up for long-term wealth and financial security. Today, he's committed to sharing his knowledge and experience with others to help them reach their full potential in the real estate industry. I want everybody to follow Nick on his Instagram, which we will have a link to in the show notes, but it is at Nick Harris underscore REALTOR. Nick, welcome. I will say welcome back to the show because it's technically your first time on keeping it real, you were featured last month as well. So welcome back. Yeah, thank you for having me. I'm excited to chat with you and hopefully give some value to the listeners. I really encourage everyone to go back a few episodes and listen to Nick's first appearance. Now, he wasn't a guest on the show in the traditional sense that he is today, but he was part of our very first ever webinar. And by the way, we have another one coming up. I don't know when this is going to release, but we have one coming up on February 25th. Hopefully this will be out by then. And for all of our listeners, we have a free promo code.

It was incredibly courageous and vulnerable. Nick basically bared his business soul to an alive coaching session. Nick came on board with somebody from the locker room and a Brent Scott, who is an amazing coach and Brent walked Nick through his entire business where Nick scored himself in various aspects. And Nick is doing really, really well in his business. And it was really cool thing because even as you listen to Nick talk about his business, you will kind of go along with it and you can score yourself and get benefit from that. So just go a few episodes back. Look for the coaching session that we had with Nick Harris. And again, we're doing this again. We have another person we're coaching at the end of at this webinar. But we have three sessions that are going on this webinar. First is a top producer. We have Daniel Dahl, who's one of the top agents in Chicago. She's going to be talking about how she's doing that. We have another coaching session with a young agent here in Chicago, Melanie Miller, who's doing three transactions a month. She's crushing it. And we're going to talk about her business. And then we have Kim Rippberg to do another video session about how to do better in video this upcoming year. And keeping it realwebinar.com, use the promo code podcast to make it free. All right, Nick. Let's get to you. Sorry about the big commercial there. But I was really excited to continue to do this. And thank you for being part of our first one. Nick reached out to me, which was, I always love it when agents do that. And it was so kind. And he had a lot of nice things to say about our show. And we just love it when agents listen. And we really appreciate you. So now let's talk about how you got involved with real estate. So walk us through it. How did you make the switch? Yeah, so again, I appreciate you having me on. I got interested in real estate. And you mentioned it in the bio and thanks for that. But got interested in real estate from an investment standpoint. So I can trace back to like 11th, 12th grade in high school, where I had an interest in real estate investing. New I wanted to build some type of rental portfolio. And so it started with just self education. That was my first experience with real estate. All of just self educating. And then I actually went to college, played college baseball. Got my degree in something completely different. Like most people do in health and exercise science. Out of college became a strength conditioning coach. Then went on to be a personal trainer and then COVID hit. And so obviously that industry kind of got thrown for a loop. And I took on a position as an account executive at United wholesale mortgage. So my first job in real estate in some degree was for a mortgage lender United wholesale mortgage, which is out of Michigan here. And so I was an account executive there. I worked on it was business to business. So I wasn't having conversations with buyers and sellers. I was having conversations with loan officers and brokers and loved it. But started to get this feel for the real estate agent side of things. And again, it wasn't something that I considered again, just self educating. And that's kind of when I picked up on different YouTube university, but also podcasts like keeping it real podcast. And started to listen to some things as far as not only real estate investing, but also becoming a potential agent. So when I was at UWM or United wholesale mortgage, we my little section got sent home because somebody had caught COVID. So we all got sent home working from home. And I thought, okay, this is the perfect opportunity for me now to actually have the time to study for my real estate license exam. So first week I was home with sent home for 14 days. First week, study for the exam. Second week, took it, passed it. Went back to the office, was actually planning on giving my two weeks notice, because I wanted to dive in as a real estate agent full time headfirst. And when I went back, another loop got a promotion. So stuck with it, I'm like, okay, let me see what I can do for. Let's see what this offers for a little bit. And after about a month of doing it, I was still just sitting with. I was sitting on my license, not actively doing anything, just waiting. And then made the decision, okay, I'm going to jump into real estate. As a real estate agent full time. So that's kind of how like the ball got rolling as far as when I got licensed. And I got licensed back in June of 2021. So this upcoming June of 2025 will be the end of year four. So I want to skip to the end of your first year and then kind of work backwards. So how did you do in your first year? Yeah, so first year. So first, so again, I started in June. So I kind of look at it in two different phases, right? Because you have all of I had June all the way through December of 2021. And then you kind of kick through December to June again, it's like my first calendar year. Sure, for my first calendar year, I believe the numbers. I believe I closed around 80 transactions in that first calendar year. And I forgot the volume of that. But our average price point in the metro Detroit area is around like 350 to 400. But I was working with primarily a lot of investors to start. So it was lower price points. Again, it was something that I had a passion for. And at that time, I wasn't yet an investor. I didn't have a portfolio of my own. But knew the lingo, knew the conversation, knew the numbers, knew what people were looking for because I had been studying it on my own. And so that's kind of where I jumped in that first, because that was all I knew as a real estate agent. And my career has progressed to primarily working with primary home buyers and sellers where we sit today. Yeah, let's talk about jumping into the investor space, which is not a common pathway for a new agent. Right? There are usually, I'm sure a lot of our listeners would like to add in working with investors onto their client lists. But most agents I talk to do not start that way. They start out as you're doing now with primary home buyers and sellers. So when you were starting out, how were you able to sort of, because well, let's talk about finding investors. Because a lot of times people who don't work with investors might think, well, do I have to have an investor first before I can start finding opportunities? So walk us through the process of what comes first? You find the deal and then you find the investor or you find the investor first and then the deal. Yeah, so the way that it worked for me specifically was I found the investor first and then found the deal. Right? So I have been running numbers and looking at different things on my own, again, just in my own interest. But for me, it worked out where I found the investor or investors first and then found the deal for them. So for me, again, I came from Health and Exercise field and I was a personal trainer. I was a personal trainer at the Diamond Club. We have a we have a chain gym here called Lifetime and it was the Diamond Club. One of the most expensive gyms in the area. So you're kind of around that clientele. And in a lot of that, just normal conversation with my client, as the client that I was training, I noticed a trend of upwards of 50, 60, 70 percent of them had real estate investment. So it kind of started there, right? Because I transitioned out of the personal training and the Health and Exercise Science field into working at a lender than I got my license. But I had those relationships still because I connected on a deeper level with those people. Remember that they had investment portfolios of their own, whether it was commercial or residential. And so that was a really easy conversation for me. I went right back into them. And so that was like, that was a small majority of where I went to the investor first. The rest of it for me was jumping into local REI, like real estate investing groups. So whether you can find something in your local market, for me, it was Facebook groups. So searching different investor groups in whatever state you're in for me, it's Michigan. And just asked to join those groups to have local meetups. So kind of connecting with different people and just having conversations. It really came from reaching out to people that I knew who had real estate investments from the investment side, but then also getting involved in some of the networks of the markets through for me, Facebook groups in my local area and going to some of those meetups and just having conversations. Yeah, that's really interesting. So you basically found the investors through, you know, your personal training. And you know, this is brings up a good point for those of us that have part-time jobs. You know, if your part-time job can feed your business, whatever it might be, maybe you're a server at a restaurant or a bartender or a teacher or, you know, a nurse or really any profession that you service the public, you know, you have opportunities to say, oh, by the way, I also do this other thing. And so I really, that's, that's was great, great way. So you found the investors, you already knew how to find the opportunities because, of course, you were looking for those yourself as well as working on the mortgage side. You probably saw how deals got put together and what investors were looking for. And that's, that's amazing. So that makes perfect sense. I also have interviewed a lot of agents who didn't start with the investor list. They found the deals first. And then they, what I've heard from many people is find the deal and the money comes a lot faster than you might think because everybody wants a deal. Yeah. Anyone who's cash heavy is as interested in parking that cash somewhere that has good tax benefits and a nice rate of return. So that's, that's fantastic. I really love that. So now a lot of times people who work with investors stay on that track and that becomes their entire life or the vast majority of their business. You've decided to branch out and work with primary home buyers and sellers, you know, the retail folks. So tell us about why did you decide to add that into your business and and how has that transition been going for you? Yeah. So the switch initially happens. They're going from focusing on investors to retail or primary home buyers and sellers. Happen number one for the motive of again, the investments in my market tend to be cash flow heavy. We're not, you know, the metroidy trade market is not a super high appreciation market. Now, of course, we have appreciation, but it's not a super high appreciation market. It's not sure. It's not your Airbnb or your short-term rental. It's more so your long-term rental properties. And so average price points lower, right? So I was, what I found was the amount of worth that I had to do to make the income that I wanted was double the amount of triple because of the price point. So for me, it came from a a want to service higher price points. And in addition to that, it gives you the ability to step back a little bit instead of closing, you know, 100 transactions a year you could do half for twice the purchase price or the sales price and still have the same outcome as far as income as a real estate agent. So that was really for me. That was the motivating factor of, and not only that, but also like I wasn't solely working with investors at the beginning, right? Like it was, it was a good chunk of my business, but I thoroughly enjoyed the process of helping someone, whether it was a first-time home buyer or helping somebody to downsize or to scale up or they had a need to move rather than just looking to make an investment. So I really started to enjoy that. And the same thing on the sales side, like I loved helping people capitalize on that career at their home and make as much as they could. We're all incentivized to do that, right? So that was what I really just started my momentum started going that way. And that's that's what I took my focus to and it's been going great. You know, in my, the most sales I've had in a year and the reason that, and I know you mentioned at the beginning, about it is 103 transactions a year over the last three years. Three years ago, it's slowly gone down, right? So three years ago, that was because it was 121 transactions, and I went to 118, and then I made the sole focus of, okay, I want to work with primary buyers and sellers now. So I cut my transactions in almost half. I think this pasture I closed 67, but the total sales volume went up north of 2 million. So half the deals were 2 million more in total volume. That's a good, a good exchange. That is, so I, you know, I was going to make a joke that you're slipping, but you know, you're becoming way more efficient and effective. That is truly incredible. So you saw bigger opportunity, maybe with the, or at least less, less hours with bigger opportunity. Yeah. And boy, that makes perfect sense. And what a great thing to sort of recognize. But a different skill set, right? Like working with primary home buyers and sellers is a different, tell us about what are the main differences between helping an investor secure property and helping, you know, someone buying their primary residents. Yeah. So, you know, for investors, a lot of it comes down to the numbers, right? The numbers have to make sense. And based on their criteria, they're looking for a long term buying hold, or they look something that's going to cash flow, be cash flow heavier, they're looking for something that's going to be appreciation heavy because on the investment scale, you kind of can look at it on either under the spectrum, right? It's either going to favor cash flow or it's going to favor appreciation. And it's hard to find that middle ground, right? So as far as that's concerned, it, you know, it's investors is more so about the numbers. Does it make sense financially? And doesn't make sense based on their criteria for a primary home buyer and seller, obviously, you know, let's talk buyer because investors were buying buyers are going to buy their next home. Of course, it has to fit the criteria that they have or the need that they want for the home. It has to have X amount of bedrooms or bathrooms or square footage or this school district, that school district, but a lot of it is emotional as well. So it's a different, it's a different spin. And for us, we are in the sales industry. It's a different spin on helping someone come to a decision based on what they told you, take that information. And instead of it being about numbers, oftentimes, the numbers are still involved. It still has to financially make sense for them, but it's also about that emotional process and what they are looking for and getting them into that home. Did you find that the transition was an easy one for you going from more of the, we'll say, left brain side, the logical, you know, just get the numbers to make sense. I'm an investor. I don't have too much emotion other than how my financial part of it is doing versus the home owner who, of course, once the financial security do, but also has a lot tied to, of course, where they live. Was that transition easy for you or was it a different skill set to learn? Not necessarily. It wasn't like a huge, wasn't a huge skill set change. You know, the same thing still go into it. It's still a real estate transaction due diligence is still the same. And the conversation is still the same. For me, it was just a little bit more fun to have the conversations with, you know, with primary home buyers and sellers and talk about that and what it means for them and their family. Same thing on the investment side, like it still has a lasting, you know, impression on them and their family and they're doing that for a reason. But for me, it was more fun to do that with primary buyers and sellers. You feel like you're making a different impact and maybe one that's a more personalized impact and one that maybe is more meaningful to, you know, to the purchaser or seller. That's wonderful. So you found that that's what you enjoy doing the most. Although I'm sure you still help investors as well. I'm sure that's not completely stopped. But making that transition is not very easy either because those two types of clients, those two client avatars, the investor and the primary you know, primary property owner or buyer is, you know, they're looking for different things and they're not congregating in the same spaces. So how did you start to find, you know, somebody looking to buy a seller primary residence? And you know, we understand how you found the investors and but how did you find the regular clients? Yeah. So for me, I have a handful of lead pillars that I that I really died in. So number one is fear of influence or SOI. Just the people that I know, right? Roll it X to people, others in your contacts, whether you know them from middle school, high school, college, local gym, whatever child's daycare, whatever the case may be and then just people who know and like and trust you. So number one is your fear of influence, just staying in contact with them. And through that also is social media, right? It's a good medium to stay top of mind and have conversations and stay involved in people's lives. So I kind of group those two, although it's one A and one B, I kind of group that into one because, you know, that it's it's my fear of influence and this is the people that I that I'm regularly staying in contact with and so or with. So fear of influence number two would be past clients and referrals. Obviously having the ability to work with those type of people and get referrals from them or have them repeat, you know, sales, maybe they bought a home four years ago and they need to they need to up size and they need to downsize, right? So number two would be past clients and referrals. And then number three, where I get a majority of my business from is actually outbound. Prospecting with circle prospecting or geographic farming and neighborhood dialing. So that's been a huge, huge one for me because that's that's allowing me now to get in contact with actual homeowners, people who own a home that also need that are looking to sell number one or potentially looking to sell, but they also if they sell, they need to move and buy somewhere and whether it's local and I can work with them on both of those. So it gives, you know, it's the same client for two transactions or they may be looking to move out of state. And so it's a good referral of passive approach to the real estate, to the real estate business as well. I want to tackle all three of these. I've been taking notes because I don't want to miss any of this because you have you first of all, you know your numbers, which is amazing and and you also understand what's working for you and what isn't and how to make refinements. So I want to start with fear of influence because that might seem the most obvious to our listeners. Of course, we should be staying in contact with the people that already know like and trust us. I'd like any talked about using social media as part of the strategy for that and I'm assuming also reaching out directly to those people, the one-to-one conversations maybe I don't know if you're texting or phone calls or email or all, but can you walk us through a little bit about how do you stay in touch with your sphere? Yeah, so a couple of different and again, I call them my game plans or my place. Again, coming in from the from the athletic background, like if I have a game plan in front of me, it's easy for me to implement. So I have a couple of things that I do on a regular basis during a normal week, work week. So Monday through Friday, Monday through Friday, I do what I call a social 3333 and you can plug whatever number you want into them. Maybe do a social 4444555, whatever it is, but for me, social media, I'm going to follow three new people today. So that's the first three, three new follows, whether it's Facebook, Instagram, whatever, medium that you're on. You following them. Correct. Yep. So it could be mutual friends. It could be if you go to your local gym or you go to a restaurant often or you go to whatever it might be or your child's daycare and they have a page, you might just see that you know, follow three of those people and I'll put you in front of them. So this is so this is again just building that database. So number one is three new follows or friend requests. Number three is three or number two is three comments on a post, whether it's a real or someone's post. And then the third category is three direct messages. So it's three follows, three comments, three direct messages. Again, just staying top of mind, staying relevant, nothing to do with real estate at all. It's just being involved in people's lives. Maybe they got married a week ago and you saw them post about it. So you're going to comment or send them a direct message. So social 3333 and with my sphere of influence, I also run a play where Monday through Friday, I send out five video text messages or five text messages a day to my sphere of influence. And these are people that are I'm already in contact with or have contact with. So what I do for me, I just go into my phone contacts, right? For other people that might be their Facebook friends or might be their Instagram followers. For me, I just use my phone contacts and I start from A to Z. And on Monday, I'll start at A. And you know, maybe it's Aaron. Aaron is the first one. I'm going to send Aaron, depending on if I've had a conversation with Aaron in the past or if I maybe I haven't talked to Aaron in a year, right? I'm just going to send the reason I like video text messages because it's more personal. People are generally more likely to open it when they can and in a scenario where they can respond, rather than just read a text that never respond. And again, it's nothing. It's nothing real estate related. It's just checking in with people. Again, you might call out. You notice that Aaron went on a vacation last week to Florida and you know, you're just saying, Hey, Aaron, it's been a while. I was just cleaning up my contacts. It came across your name. I actually saw you went to Florida last week. It looked awesome. Hope you had good weather. We'd love to catch up with you and hear more about what's going on in your life. I hope you're doing well and let's catch up soon. Right. So I send five of those a day. One second. So thank you. That is amazing stuff. So you're using social media almost as a research and development arm of your company to see, hey, I'm going to call Aaron. I need to I want to talk about something with Aaron. Let me look to see if he's posted anything to see maybe I something I could talk about. If there's no posts, then you know, you might just check in. Hey, how's it going? I wanted to check in see how you're doing. How's work, but whatever. And are you doing that via like if your iPhone user are using FaceTime, are you using a third party solution like bomb bomb or loom? How are you doing that? Yeah. So for me, it's just it's just my phone. So I use my iPhone and I send a video, right? And if it's you know, oh, yeah, I'm sorry, not FaceTime. Yeah, just a video. Yeah. If you have the discrepancy of sometimes the videos don't show up great to Android's and vice versa. So you know, in those scenarios, maybe I just send a voice recording or I'll send an actual text message, but I try to send a video text message as often as I can. And yeah, it's just pick five. And what I found is as I'm working through my contacts and sending five a day Monday through Friday, it takes me, you know, each video is maybe 10 seconds long. If you have something to really talk about, maybe you're at like 30 seconds. But I sent five a day and what I found is I get through my entire contact list about once a quarter. So now I'm doing that again, starting over a disease and I'm in contact with those people four times a year at a minimum. So everyone gets four video messages from you. By the way, pro tip for anyone listening. If you are an iPhone user, I don't know how to do this the reverse way, but as an iPhone user, if you are sending messages and you are sending them to an Android user, it does. It can and may degrade the quality because Apple has a closed system. And that's just how they play. But what you can do is you can copy the iCloud link and send them the direct link and they can view that directly in a web browser. So there is a way to get it to them. And it looks almost identical to if you were to send them, in other words, it shows up almost identically in their text chain as it would if you would have sent it directly to them. So for anyone out there who has got a lot of Android users in your in your sphere, in your contact list, consider that as a little pro tip. So I love that. So every one of your customers, sorry, every one of your friends, really, everybody in your sphere gets four messages a day of, hey, just thinking about you, hope all as well. Let's catch up. How often, and I don't think the reason to do this are rather the expectation probably isn't, well, they're going to call me right back. Or I would assume most of them probably don't. But talk about why do you do this? Yeah, so again, again, like you mentioned, it's not always that you're going to get a response, it's not always that you're going to be that you're, I mean, the ultimate goal is to say, hey, Nick, thanks for reaching out. We're actually thinking about selling our house. Sure, of course. That's almost too easy, right? But that's up to the gods, right? So yeah. Right, so I mean, the whole part of it is that you at least put yourself in front of them, right? Even if they're not in a position to respond, even if they never respond, they heard from you, they might like the message or at least you know they got it, right? And it's just, it's just to be a person, be relevant, right? Be a human being, have conversations, let them know you're thinking about them, everybody likes to be thought of. And if you can bring up recent things in their lives, or you remember something that happened recently in their life and you can bring it up, or you bring up a memory of, you know, two years ago, the last time you saw me, you bring up a memory, like people like that stuff. So yeah, so that it's huge, you know, you just, for me, it's just staying top of mind being in front of people. And the same thing goes for social media, right? Not everyone likes your folks, not everyone is commenting underpost. But, you know, I can't tell you how many times I've gone to a wedding from a, from a friend in college and I haven't seen, you know, I haven't seen potentially the people that are at that wedding in five, six, seven, eight years. And someone will walk up to me and the first thing, one of the first things they say to me is it looks like you're, you're killing it in real estate. Like, congratulations, how's everything going, right? And I had no idea like other than being friends with them on social media, they haven't shown any interest. But it's being top of mind, it's being there. So that when someone thinks of real estate, it's, oh yeah, next to real estate agent, I see you doing really well, I should reach out to them. Yeah. And, and I, again, just that if everyone just did a video message to everyone in their sphere four times a year, you will see results from that. And you might not see them this year, you might not see them even next year because people would only buy and sell every seven years or so over primary residence. So it might not happen right away. But it is people remember, first of all, let's all think about does any service provider in our life? Anyone? Is it accountants, financial advisors, our dentist, our, you know, person who cuts our hair? You know, these are all service providers that, you know, you can always go elsewhere, our attorneys, you know, things like that, our accountant. How many of those are sending, how many of those are sending you a video message? I'm going to guess zero. So just by doing this alone, you're not only differentiating yourself for most REALTORS, 99% of REALTORS don't do this, but 99% of the other people they pay for a very services aren't doing this either. And, and you're not asking them for anything. You're not saying, I need to say all this month, I hope you're ready to buy yourself, which can come across in some of these messaging if you're not really showing authentic interest. So Nick is doing something very, very smart. And he's also an authentic person. He's doing this because he cares about people. And he's ultimately saying, how do I connect with you? I want to connect with you. I'm thinking about you. You're important to me. And I'll give you one other pro tip for those of you that are going, oh my gosh, I don't, you know, sometimes I don't know what to say. Nick just gave a bunch of examples of what he might say. You know, use LinkedIn for this too. Don't forget about LinkedIn. LinkedIn will tell you whether somebody's got a job promotion or if they've celebrated a milestone at their job, you know, how many years they've been there or you can also look up the company they work for and see on Google news. Maybe you should know the company they work for. If you do, look, see if there's anything cool going on in that company. Hey, I just saw an article. I'm such and such. Right? These are connectors. And Nick obviously does this really, really well. So cheers to you, Nick, for that. And now we want to talk about comments. So this is a pretty simple one. We're talking about social media comments on your 333. We're talking about, you know, basically just commenting on people's posts. I'm guessing saying, hey, that vacation looks awesome or, hey, that dinner looks great or glad your kids did that recital or is that sort of the type of. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Again, it's being top of mind. But with social media, it also helps the algorithm. Right? The more the more that DJ and I are in conversation, the more likely Instagram before using Instagram as an example, if DJ and I are in conversation, I'm more likely now to see DJ's post and DJ's more likely to see my post. So when I do go to post anything that it might be whether it's a video or if you are doing like just listed your soul, there's something to be said for that because it is a top of mind relevancy thing. But now you're more likely to see it. And if you're in contact with three new people a day sending comments or direct messages, those people are more likely to see your information. And again, it's that it's that human piece of just having conversation with people and commenting on what's going on in their life. Yeah, I'll share with everyone just a quick strategy that I'm using in the recruiting arm, which I think you can transpose this over into the how do I get clients side? So I used to think of really clever ways to recruit REALTORS via email and have cute little, you know, funny sayings or something that was make people chuckle or maybe sometimes I just say, hey, this is all the cool stuff we offer. You should look at us if you're ever thinking about making a switch, give us a call. You know, and I did that for 13 years for almost 14 years with very limited success, right? Because what I took me a long time to figure this out. And this is probably what we all know anyway, people don't really like to be sold or at least not have there are people that do like to be sold. But they're in the vast minority, I think of the public. The other, you know, the vast majority of people want to be heard and seen and felt like, you know, they're cared about. So how do you demonstrate that in a reach out? Well, Nick just gave you a whole bunch of reasons. Know what's going on in their life. Reach out to them, comment on their posts, you know, send them a video and ask them how their kids are doing or how, you know, ex in their business or their life is doing. But what I started doing for recruiting and a Nick, I want to get your impression of this is now I send a basically a two sentence email, even if it's somebody I've never talked to before. And usually I'll know that I'll know something about them. So I'll say, hey, I noticed you, you're up 300% this year. Like that's incredible in this market. Just curious, how are you doing that? I'd love to find out more about you. And I have got so many responses. I went from a point one response. Now these are cold emails. They don't know me. They're not in my sphere. I would get a point one response. So very, very few. I'm getting a point five response now, which doesn't sound like much. It's still half of 1%. But I can send out lots of these messages in a, I can't really scale it very easily. But I can send these out very quickly. It shows that I know something about them. And it's asking them to engage. I'm going, I might say like, wow, that's really amazing. How do you do that? It's kind of what we do on the show, right? So I'm curious to Nick, if you receive, because you get recruited, you're a big, a big producer in Detroit. What kind of recruiting messages do you get to set a curiosity? Yeah, I mean, I actually haven't really seen that. It's usually the, you know, a couple paragraphs long. Here's what we offer. Yeah. And it's the catchy, the catchy subject line that you get every single time. So it's a pretty quick, you know, see and delete situation. But yeah, I mean, I really like that. I think that's good. Everybody wants to talk about themselves and what they're doing and what's working. Everybody's pretty quick to do that, right? So it gives people the opportunity to talk about themselves and, and, and, you know, who knows how long who who knows how long ago they were able to do that, but people do like to speak on themselves and what they're doing and what's going on in their life. So give them an opportunity to do it. And by the way, I want to mention how Nick got in contact with us. He reached out. He is doing exactly what he did to us is exactly what he does with his clients, which he's he reached out. He said, Hey, I really like your show. I've been a listener for for a long time. I've listened to it's like over 200 episodes, which I haven't even listened to 200 episodes of my own show. But I appreciate that you did. And you said, it's really made an impact on me. And I'd like to tell you about what impact it's made. He sent this to me in an Instagram drug message. And it's not like I don't get those every single day of the year. I probably get one or two of those a week at best and we have lots of listeners, ravaging 12,000 downloads a day. So there's lots of people listening. But Nick went out of his way to say, here's what your show means to me. And I really appreciate you doing what you do. And he didn't say, I want to be a guest. How do you have me on? He just said, Hey, this means a lot to me. Thank you. And I was like, Oh, I definitely want to have this guy on. And you know, because number one, he's super flattering. And you know, a a a turn of phrase can always catch my eye. But also he told me about the reason I do this show is to make an impact to have help people. And and I'm just asking the question. So it's really our guests like Nick that are actually doing the heavy lifting. But I'm glad that it has an impact. And I'm grateful to Nick for saying, Hey, thank you for doing this because I just I you know, getting a thank you is always appreciated. And it just so happened. You were talking about for two at his timing. Nick did that and it the exact moment in my we were planning our first webinar. And I said, I need somebody to be coached. And I go, Oh, this is the guy. I mean, it was like 10 minutes before I was like, I got to get somebody to be coached. I have all these listeners. I don't want to have to do an announcement and say, I want to be coached and everyone's going to, you know, and then I'm going to have to filter through it. And then this bad hit my inbox out of nowhere. And things like that happen. And then a week later, you know, two weeks later, Nick was on the show. And now he's being interviewed. So things like this, these things do have impact. You know, and again, this isn't Nick's doing us a favor. So this isn't really helping Nick as a business owner. But it's helping me and my podcasts. And I'm grateful that it helps him as well. So just wanted to just share that story because those things happen, you know, reach out and stay in touch with the people that that means something to you. Okay, so then let's talk about direct messages. So we're now back to, you know, you're sending videos. You're following three people a day. You're commenting on there on posts. And what do you send in a direct message? Yeah. So I think number one, the lowest hanging fruit when it comes to sending a message is Facebook because Facebook every single day gives you a list of who's birthdays it, right? Whoever's birthday is today. And you know, if you have north of 500 friends that you're, you know, that you're following or that you're friends with on Facebook, I can guarantee it's at least someone's birthday today, right? So that's kind of lowest hanging fruit. And what I do there, again, it's the personal, it's the personalized message, right? So rather than just posting on our wall, like potentially hundreds of people are going to do, send them a direct message or send them a text message. But in terms of social media platforms, send them the direct message or whatever, you know, whatever personal spend you want to put on it, that's a good one to do. And then very similar, like if it's not a birthday, again, it could be, you know, let's say you've made it through your three comments. And you're looking for another reason to reach out to someone else. So it could be a story or it could be a feed post that they posted on. And again, they went on vacation, they just got married, they just had a baby or the kid just, you know, scored the winning goal in their soccer game or whatever it might be. You know, it's a reason to reach out and again, just send a personal message. And again, it helps the algorithm. So you're staying on top of mind and being in front of people. Love it. Now I want to quickly just ask about your content that you post that is, you know, on social media. So how often are you doing it and what types of content are you posting? Because we talked about how you're interacting with followers and friends. But what are you actually posting if anything? Yeah. Yeah. So I utilize, I utilize two platforms regularly, Facebook and Instagram. Those are kind of my two. Those are those are where I'm at. I really like Instagram. I just like the platform of it. But also it's easy for me to use. And that's where I have most of my interaction. So what I'm doing is I'm trying to put up anywhere from three to five stories a day. And those are just days in a life, right? That's if I'm on a showing or if I'm on a listing appointment, I just say if I have a listing coming soon or you know, you're out of showing and you see something funny. Like use that opportunity to post and put it on a story. I use my feed. I'm usually posting at least once, if not twice a day on my feed on Instagram and on Facebook. I do utilize just listed just sold, right? And for nothing else, but to stay top of mind to let people know, hey, I'm doing business. And again, it's it goes back to that scenario where you know, I'm at a wedding. Haven't talked to somebody in 10 years and we've been friends on Facebook and all the sudden, hey, you know, Nick, it looks like you're doing great with real estate, right? Don't people are going to see it, right? So, but I also try to do more value ad post as well. So, you know, I do a lot for the I have been starting to post more for the agent community, like best tips and tricks and what I'm doing that's working. And so I'm doing a lot of that like real, reals in the for on Instagram, where that has become a big piece of my real estate content or my Instagram content is actually geared towards real estate agents and helping them. So again, it for a real estate agent, it's just top of mind post what you're doing. Do the things you're doing. If you're brand new, one of the things that I started with anytime you're going to a show. Or even if you don't have a showing schedule, right? Like for the brand new real estate agent, and I say this all the time, the brand new real estate agent doesn't have any clients, you're going out and you're probably practicing getting into into into houses by opening up lock boxes and just going to see homes and doing some self teaching of like, okay, how would I orchestrate the showing or, you know, whatever I might be use those opportunities pull out your phone and video tape yourself opening the door or, you know, walking through the home and it's a really nice kitchen or it's a really nice bathroom or you see something funny or something even something that's a little bit ugly, right? I mean, post about it. It shows people that you're in the industry. It shows people that you're active, that you're doing things. One of the biggest things that I see most people that fall short on is they're posting things outside of the industry other than their personal life and family, right? So for instance, like, you know, if you're if for me it's you're working out in the morning and I can't tell whether you're whether you're target audience is someone that you're trying to become a personal trainer for because you're recording all of your workouts and putting them online or are you trying to push your content out to let people know that hey, I'm a real estate agent. Like be really clear on what your message is and what you want to be known for and a lot of those lines, I mean, for my for my personal page on Facebook and Instagram, I do tend to be about 60 to 70% business and 30 to 40% personal. I do like a mix of both, but I definitely want that business opportunity to let people know that hey, this is what I'm doing. So on your business page, when it comes to video, you're probably not posting, hey, just finished a tough workout. That would go more on your personal page. So I actually so I just have one page. So my personal is my business and my business. So you'll got so the vast majority of your content is going to be business. You said about a 70 30 split and then you're also posting here's day in the life. Here's what else I do outside of that. And if we really think about this strategy. So let's talk. Let's think about what Nick's doing from a much larger. And by the way, I won't actually before I get to that, when I talk about Nick mentioning something and we just quickly breeze past it, I want to back up. He's posting content for other REALTORS. Now let's think about why Nick might be doing that or what's the benefit other than Nick being a wonderful guy and giving away some value to the audience. Yes, what might come his way as a result? Well, a person is doing 103 deals a year. Probably need some help at some point. He is going to hit his maximum number of hours and he is going to need a team maybe or he's going to say, nope, I'm just going to stay myself. But having options is a good thing. And so Nick is showing the community. Here's what I do. I can show you how to do this or here's some free tips. And guess what people are going to do with Nick. They're going to reach out and say, I want to talk to you. I want to I want to join forces with you. And Nick also works for a company that has this really cool referral system where you can have people kind of working with you. And so this is a very, very wise, wise strategy for anybody who's looking to build their team at track more ages. I should be doing this for recruiting agents. So this that is a really, really smart strategy. And also at the very least, even if it never attracts another agent, you're helping people, which is incredible. Right. So Nick's doing all of those things. And yeah, so incredible stuff there. Yeah, I would say one more thing. One benefit of that too is it gets you recognized by other agents in your market. Right. So they feel like they know you. Exactly. Exactly. And if they see that, hey, this is someone who is well educated, well knowledgeable, closing a lot of deals. Guess what? When your offer shows up in their inbox, you have some form of familiarity, whether they've worked it through or not. And I mean, at this day and age, everybody, I mean, if we're going out to a restaurant, right? If we're going to go to a restaurant, the first thing most people do, it's not asking a friend. It's going to reviews and it's going to their social media page to see what does the menu look like? What does the atmosphere feel like? So I mean, even in that, right? I mean, it's it forms the educational background of saying, okay, Nick's offer just ended up in my inbox. He's working with a client. Like, is this someone because listing agents as you should, you're doing your due diligence on not only the buyer, but also the agent to make sure that the agent's closed. And so it helps with that as well. I love that. So you're really hitting gosh, all sides from a marketing perspective, I that's my background and I'm beyond impressed with this. I want to talk about now, let's move over to your past clients, your repeat business. So we're moving away from sort of the finding, attracting new business while you're still we're still talking about that. But what are we doing to maintain and deepen the relationships of those that we've worked with before? Yeah, so with with past clients, I mean, your past client campaign, if you will, your past client campaign is super important whether whether that's organized through a your CRM, I use follow up boss. So whether it's organized through that, you're giving tags to know when to reach out, whether it's the video text messages because those past clients become ice here of influence in their in my context. So I'm talking to them at least four times a year. What I also recommend for past clients, I do something that's very, very simple. At the beginning of the year, and if you haven't yet, do it now, I would print off a one page sheet of paper that shows all 12 months. And the goal is to have something in every single month a reason to reach out. So whether you're doing client events. So for me, you know, I do three client events for my past clients, my closed clients who are my clients, I don't I don't necessarily love client and past clients because they're still your clients. So three client events a year, winter, fall, and then a summer. And then some additional touch points like maybe you do, this is one that I capitalize on is my team runs what we call a CMA week and we make it fun within our team. It's a competitive atmosphere and there's, you know, there's rewards or prizes for the team that wins or the individual that wins. But three times a year, I'm going to reach out to all of my past clients or people within my sphere of influence and tell them the benefit of, you know, most people are always interested in the value of their home, right? And most people go to different sites and like everyone wants to know, what is their equity stake in their home? Of course, I just I just got my Zillow report today. And by the way, whether we agree or disagree that Zillow's accurate, I jump on that email, even though I could, well, I'd hope I could at least do it as good of a job running a CMA on myself. I don't run a CMA on myself, but guess what Zillow does every month for me. And I got that email and I jumped, it was actually down 0.1% and I actually got a little upset. But honestly, that's kind of I'm not selling. It's kind of a silly thing. I shouldn't really be paying attention. It's like looking at your weight every single day. It's probably not a great idea because of weights fluctuate like price, home prices, month to month or day to day. But everybody wants to know. So I love that you do that. Yeah. So CMA week, right? And another benefit of that is if you have somebody who purchased a home and did not put 20% down, they have private mortgage insurance, right? And so if they purchased a home two years ago, but they might have a position now to where they have enough equity to save them that $100 a month or whatever their private mortgage insurance is now you're actually giving them something of value. It's not just a home value estimate. You're also saying, Hey, this could be something you could take to your lender and wave your PMI and it could save you $100 to $200 a month, right? So I do three client events. I do three CMA weeks and my team does three CMA weeks. So that covers half of the year. That's six touch points. I also do three what I call beyond real estate weeks. So I pick three different months and it's something not real estate related, right? It's for me around Thanksgiving and around the Christmas time around Christmas time. I'll do a pie drop off or how people come and pick up ice. So just something again, personal doesn't have to do with real estate. Just say thank you. Wanted to give this to you and your family. And again, figure out what that is for you. Something beyond real estate. So that takes up nine of the 12 and then the other three what I personally do in Michigan are whether it's very seasonal. So I generally send out three times a year in preparation of the winter and preparation of summer and then going back into the winter. I'll send or I'm sorry, so going into the winter so like sometime in the fall and then in the spring heading into the summer and then the spring heading into the fall heading into the winter. I send out a checklist of different things. You know, what might just be as simple as make sure you're changing your furnace filters and make sure that you're changing your smoke detector batteries. For us again, there's things where in the winter is if you're going to go on vacation for a week and we're expecting, you know, but freezing weather, you do not want to have your temperature set lower than about 65 degrees in your home or your pipes could freeze. So it's just little things like that where, you know, home maintenance tips, tips and tricks and here's what to expect. And again, it's just giving something a value but also being relevant and staying top of mind. So each month and thank you for that tip. Each month you have some sort of touch point. You mentioned it could be the four video calls. It could be the client appreciation events. It could be the seasonal. Hey, get ready for this season. It could be the non real estate related things that you're doing. And but I didn't hear is what I didn't hear is newsletter. Are you an email newsletter guy? I am not. I am not. Interesting. So you're the first person I've talked to that is not now. Why are you not doing email newsletter? So for me, personally, it becomes one of those things where number one, it can become repetitive and we're kind of fluffing it up. And so for me is I want to give tax full outreaches with actual value. And I want it to be personal, not something that they feel like is being spread out throughout 200 different people. Right. So for me, that I mean, it's just a personal preference. It's something that I haven't done for that reason. And that's really the only reason why. I wrote an article for a real estate magazine once in the title. We'll tell you my opinion, which was nobody wants to read your real estate newsletter. So that was my opinion. But regardless of whether people want to read a real estate newsletter or not, by the way, I get about a hundred of these from agents, which I've never signed up for. By the never once sign up for real estate newsletter. And these are not my past REALTORS that help me buy and sell properties. These are just other REALTORS who are like, hey, he's on my contact list, he's getting my newsletter. And you know, it's fine. It's nice. It's whatever. I've never read one of them, not one. And maybe I'm different. Maybe your clients, everybody's clients love to read that. I don't know. But certainly I don't read them. And again, it's also what everyone else is already doing. So you don't need to set out a real estate newsletter. You're the person sitting next to you probably is. But I love that I love that you're not doing that because that is a very common strategy that agents do. And then they think, well, I'm touching my clients once a month with this newsletter. And yeah, technically you are. But maybe there's a way that you could do that more effectively. And more like you said, you know, more strict or yeah, more strategically, right? You're really thinking about how do I actually provide value? Not just like, and by the way, again, this goes back to my recruiting. I used to just say, here's all the cool stuff I'm up to. Here's all the cool stuff our firm's doing. And nobody really cared that much. As much as I thought it was cool. And I went, oh, yeah, because every firm says that every firm says they're the greatest support technology and training everybody says it. So it's not all that differentiated. It's more about getting a personalized, some personalized attention. Okay. Now I want to switch to so by the way, that takes care of your repeat clients because they're and again, again, repeat clients is ongoing. Clients is really the phrase, you were touching them in some way and in different ways every single month. And so they're getting a lot of contact with you and your business, but in really fun and engaging ways. So I love that. And now let's get into circle prospecting. For those of us that don't know what circle prospecting is, could you explain that? Yeah. So circle prospecting the way that I kind of capitalize on it and the way that I, the way that I kind of explain it is that it's outbound prospecting. And I use it around a couple of different scenarios, but it's it's pulling local homeowners contact information. You have their address, you have their phone number, sometimes, you know, some platforms offer the email as well. I like the cold outreach of a phone call. And so you're getting in contact with homeowners and giving them a call based on, you know, a handful of different reasons. So what I do is I have a couple of different strategies that I use or reasons to call. So number one, and one that a lot of people don't think about is around buyers. Number one is if you, if you have a buyer, who is looking in a specific neighborhood, it's a really good reason to call. It's a more of like a geographic for me. You call around for your buyer in a specific neighborhood or within a specific school district. And it's having conversations with those homeowners saying I have an active buyer looking to move in to a home within the next couple of months. Curious if you've had any thought of potentially making a move or selling your home. If you got a price that made sense, even if it was off market, right? I love that piece of it because a lot of people, the guard kind of comes down and it's like, well, I don't want to get my home ready. I don't want to have a ton of people come into the home and what happens if someone steals something and all of the things that happen with that. So buyers that are looking in specific areas, the other reason I use it around my buyers is let's say they put it in an offer on a home and maybe the offer didn't get accepted. Well, I now know that that neighborhood is something that they're looking for. So why wouldn't I capitalize on that opportunity to call those local homeowners in the neighborhood and say, hey, my buyer just made an offer on a home that was for sale in your neighborhood. Unfortunately, we got beat out. I'm curious if you happen to have an insane conversation. I'm curious if you happen to have any thought of selling. If you got a price that made sense, I'm working with someone actively making offers and looking to move into the area. The other time that I use it for my buyers is if I have gone under contract or closed on a home because it's a really good opportunity. And same thing could be said if you're on a team or you're in an office and someone had a buyer going under contract in an area that you would want to work or service might as well use that as an opportunity as well to pick up potential listings. So that's why I'm curious. I use it on multiple occasions, but when I have a home that I'm going to be putting on the market, I usually call it four different times when we're in coming soon status or the week before going live, the week or the day we go live, that week we go live, the week we go pending and the week that it actually closes and is sold. Every call is a little bit different, right? The first two calls in coming soon and active, I'm looking for a buyer, but I'm also getting my name out there to the local neighbors to say, hey, I'm a real estate agent actively listing a home in your neighborhood. I want them to know that Nick Harris is getting ready to list a home in their neighborhood. So that's where that piece of it comes in. It's the coming soon and the active. And then once we go pending and once we sell, I now have actual information to give to them. I can tell them, hey, we listed at X price and we had this many showing, we got this many offers and it ended up going under contract price, right? You have actual information and market data to present to them and in a great scenario, right? Where let's say you did end up getting multiple offers, you have five offers, you can only take one. So that means there's four buyers that are still out there. And if you can go to a homeowner and say, hey, we ended up getting five offers. So there's still four buyers that are actively looking in this neighborhood. I'm just curious if you happen if you happen to have any thought of making a move or selling your home, if you got a person that will hold. I'm pausing because my jaw is dropping. So you, I'm not even, I've done this for seven years. I've never, never heard of anybody doing this. So we are talking about you are contacting. These are cold calls. These are the coldest of cold calls. These are people that do not know you, do, do not know whether they even like or trust you. You are saying, hey, I'm, first of all, I'm listing a home in this area. Hate, by the way, I just went pending as the second call. Third and the fourth would be, hey, here's what just happened. And we had a lot of showings. We had a lot of offers. And I was curious. And here's what happened. Would you be curious in participating in this in some way? That is unbelievable. That is amazing. What are the, what are the responses when you make these calls? Yeah. So you're, you know, you're going to get a mix of everything, right? I mean, you can kind of go up both ends of the spectrum. You're going to have the person that says, yes, I've actually been thinking about it. We love to have you over today. And then you're going to have the people who can't hang up on you fast enough. Right. So, and then anything in between, you know, it's all about having those tactful conversations. And these are the conversations that I have with the agents that I, that I help coach and mentor, if you will, and that reach out to me. And these are the conversations that I have with them about how to best script and put into, put into words to keep a conversation going, right? Because if someone shows, if they're not quick to get you off the phone, they have some interest at some, some level, right? There's some interest, even if it's just knowing the value of their home. So how can you continue that conversation to, again, be top of mind, when they do think about it, but also get in front of them, whether it's a home estimate or just to give them data, even if it's just to get their email. Now they're in your database. You have a name, a number you haven't addressed, and you have an email. Now they're in your database. And next time a home cell is you're sending them an update of, hey, another home just sold in your neighborhood. Here's what it's sold for. Right. So, you know, you have, you have a, you have a wide variety of different conversations that can take place anywhere on that spectrum. It's either, hey, come, you know, ready to go, come list me. It could be a get off the phone, never call me again, or it could be anything in the middle where you're just trying to pull out as much information as you can. And it might be leaving voice mails that never get returned. Exactly. That probably happens to. And again, Nick's not trying to make a sale. He is presenting something that may be of interest to the person he's calling, right? He's not selling anything. He's not saying, hey, I want to list your property. Everybody wants to list everybody's property. Of course, he's saying, hey, this is a thing that happened that's relevant to you. And by the way, you know, we know everyone, every neighbor's nosy, you talk about open houses. I forgot that was one of the calls. So, open house, that was, did I get that right? Yeah. So, like, if you're in, if you're in a two-in-one, soon status, they're getting ready to go live and you're planning on having an open house, the opening weekend, or the second weekend, it's a good opportunity to invite those neighbors to the open house and how they get to experience what it is that you do at an open house as well. And to get to see what the inside of their neighbor's home looks like, which is also something they're very interested in. That's most often what people are interested in. Of course. And it gives you an opportunity to get them signed in and now you have their email address. Exactly. I mean, this, Nick, I, I have to say, I'm absolutely floored by the tightness of this and you're willingness to do very difficult things. It is not a lot of fun to pick up the phone and call somebody who's a homeowner who really doesn't want the phone call and then be able to have a nice conversation. Yes, it happens. And that's great. And you also get a lot of hang-ups, probably some unkind messages as well, unkind interactions. And it's worth still worth doing. It's kind of like doing push-ups in the gym and until you collapse, which I, by the way, I, or rather, I'll give a different one. If anyone wants to see a really brutal exercise, there's a lot of them. Look up eccentric pull-ups, which I was doing yesterday. Those are no fun. And those, those, you pull yourself up one and then slowly go down seven seconds. That's the way we do it. And it's not like I can do a dozen push-ups. I can't, or pull-ups. I can do about seven at my best. And those are critical because they really help build the muscle faster and they're no fun at all and they hurt and you want to cry afterwards. So, but that's why they're worth doing. So I always think, you know, life is about in my opinion, or rather the most, the most fulfillment, I think, in life comes from doing really hard things that are good for you. And calling everybody in a neighborhood to let them know about this property is good for them and it's good for you. So it's actually a win-win, even if they tell you to buzz off. Okay, great. Moving on to the next house. That is unbelievably. I cannot tell you. I can say to me that the benefit of that arm of my business and that pillar of building leads is that you're not only working with sellers, number one, because they actively own the home. But it's also potential for two deals, right? Because they need to go and buy a new home. They may, you know, they may have the opportunity for they're going to live with family, they're going to rent. But more often than not, you know, I was from my experience, over 50% of the time, they're either looking to move somewhere locally, whether it's downsize or upsize, or they're looking to move out of state. And so it's a referral for you as well. Yeah, it's a no-brainer. But it requires doing those pull-ups that are no fun. But it doesn't need to be fun. It just needs to be effective and it needs to be good for the other person. And this, these kind of quote, you know, I live in a condo building. We only have 45 units. We don't have hundreds and hundreds of units. So with somebody wants to live in our building, there's limited inventory. There's usually only one place for sale at best at any given time. Nobody has ever called me and said, and by the way, we have tears. So like, if I'm, you know, my particular unit's the same of, you know, seven other tears. And I've never gotten one phone call. Never got one postcard. Never received one letter saying, hey, I just sold so and so's place. I have, we got a lot of people interested. Would you be interested in having a conversation? Because I want to love to connect you with these, these buyers. Not one. And I don't think it's because everyone knows I'm an agent because I don't even practice real estate. So you could definitely prospect. And amazing. So I'm sure if Nick was here in Chicago, I, and he sold something in my building, I would get a call from him. So that's, that's incredible. So we're talking about neighborhood dialing. Again, you're willing to do a lot of things that, and again, I suspect this comes back to your excellent strengths in sports, you know, you, you were a college athlete. And in order to rise to that level, you just had to work a lot harder than most people, right? You had to put in the time that most weren't willing to do that as a personal trainer. You have to keep your body in an incredible shape, also to be an athlete too. I imagine that discipline really serves you in your business now. Yeah, absolutely. I think it's played a huge role. And again, it's for me, it's, it's having similar to that athletic background. It's having a game plan in motion. And then it's just acting on it, right? A lot of people just don't know what to do. Or what their daily schedule should look like. And my, my calendars filled out for every, I mean, I have something blocked off every moment of my working day, where I have a task that I'm going to be doing from the moment I start to the moment I'm done. And then when I'm done, I'm clocked out on with my family, I'm with my daughter and my wife. And, everything that I do is again, it's just having knowing what to do and then actually implementing it. I think that knowing what to do is the easy part, whether it's talking to different people or finding a mentor or even just reaching out to me, like helping with those things is the actual implementation and putting it into your calendar that a lot of people just, they can't do. Yeah, we're talking about, you know, intentionally creating the day that you think is most effective for you. And instead of being reactionary, right, we all have things flying at us, emails, client-appointing, client phone calls, problems, every, you know, every transaction has a problem at some point. So you have, you're going to have plenty to do today, whether you plan your day or not. But, you know, what at what cost, right? Does it come at the cost of time with your daughter or your wife, right? If you don't have time plan to handle not only what's coming in, but also how to keep the business running, meaning how am I growing my business every single day, not just reacting to my business, you're going to be not only less efficient, but you're going to have a lot more stress in your life. You know, you're going to be waiting for things to happen. Nick doesn't wait for things to happen. He just does the things that he knows are going to ultimately get him results and he makes modifications along the way. I'm sure there's been things you've tried that you're like, that just doesn't work for me. And I'm going to try something else. Is that happened where you've tried various, you know, I always think people who are the most successful fail the most, and they did just the failures don't get really talked about. But can you share with us one of your one of your failures just so that everybody can feel like you're a human being. You have issues just like everybody else. Yeah, I mean, there's definitely, you know, there's things that I've tried that just haven't worked. I can't necessarily think of anything off the top of my head, but there's absolutely things that I've tried and just don't end up working. I think where actually most people fall short is not doing things long enough, not giving it enough time to actually produce fruit. Right. I mean, it's everybody you can hear like stick to a couple of different things. It's the same thing with social media like master one. Don't try to be on all platforms doing everything. Stick with one. Do it really well. And then maybe once you've mastered it, you can move into a second, you know, a second form. But anything that anything, you know, work doing today needs to be worth doing for a decade. And it's about sticking to it long enough to actually see the fruit of it. You know, most people are, and this is a real estate is very cyclical, right? I mean, you, the the client that you're working with today and even the contract that you signed today, if you're working with a buyer, that's not closing in, you know, in most cases throughout the US, it's not closing for a month, if not two months from now. So even the work that you're putting in today, doesn't bear fruit for at least another month or two. And at the same thing can go with generating leads, prospecting, and whatever you're doing, working on your business and in your business, it's not going to have, you know, it's not going to have a payout today. Do it long enough to give it time. And so generally, my recommendation is if if you can stick with something for about six months, do it for six months, if you're absolutely seeing nothing from that, then you have two options. It's either the platform or whatever you're doing is not working or you need to change the way you're doing it. Yeah, it's funny. I, I'm going through a version of this myself. So I created this new marketing campaign. I'm doing videos to recruit agents. I talked about how I'm changing up my emails. And we have now seen a 74 and a half percent increase in traffic to our recruiting website, which is amazing, except I'm not seeing a lot of conversions into people who are really interested in reaching out. So now I have to go, okay, I know how to drive traffic to the website through the content I create. Now I need to figure out which, you know, when people build things too, they get really emotionally invested in them, whether it's, you know, an ad you put out, whether it's a brochure, whether it's a technique you try, you get emotionally connected to it. And I got emotionally, I get emotionally connected to the website I built because it's beautiful. I think it works perfectly. It's just the best looking, you know, recruiting REALTOR website that I've ever seen and I'm very proud of it. Yes, it's not converting. So I have to now eat a little bit of humble pie and go, okay, now I need to figure out how to get people to take action. And even though aesthetically, I think it looks perfect, there's something I'm missing. There's something it's not quite hitting. And now I have to figure that out. But the reality of it is, is I just, I also have to keep driving traffic there. So we're talking about refinement. And Nick is really an unbelievable refiner. He knows all of his numbers. When you go back and listen to his coaching session, you will find out he knows exactly what converts. He knows how much time to put in. And as a result of all of knowing his numbers, we talk about knowing your numbers in the market. But knowing your numbers in your business really helps you figure out how to plan your day. I mean, that tells you, okay, I have to put certain amount of money in, you know, I'm sorry, I started to put certain amount of time in this bucket, this bucket, in this bucket. Why only have, you know, X number of hours in the day. Nick figures that out ahead of time. And then he just sticks to his bucket, sticks to his time block it. From an accountability perspective, we didn't talk about that. I just wanted to maybe end with this. Do you have an accountability partner? Do you have a coach? How are you staying? Because, you know, obviously, you're a super self-discipline guy. I'm sure accountability, you had a coach as an athlete, you know, what is your sort of processor on getting coached? Yeah, so I do have a coach within my organization and within my team. And one of the nice things about the organization that I'm with, again, that coach is financially incentivized for me to do well with better he does, right? But in addition to that, you know, it's I do have a coach and I do have through that. And it's something that's, you know, that I take very seriously and having some type of mentor or some type of coach to help not only give you direction, but also track metrics, see what's working, what's not, give different alternatives and actually see what it is that you're doing, being held accountable to someone, whether it's a coach or a friend, whatever the case may be, someone who, someone who's, ideally, someone who's in a position that you want to be in is where we should be looking. And who's done what you want to do. That's where we should be looking. And so I highly recommend it. But yes, I do have a coach and someone who keeps me accountable to that. And for no other reason, then I find that we are, we are, we will let ourselves off the hook before we will disappoint someone else. Right? We will watch that extra hour of TV because we had a hard day. But if we had an appointment set with somebody, I bet we'd make it. I know I would. So for no other reason than getting yourself to do thing, this is embarrassing. I'll share this with people. I have a challenge waking up at the time that I want to wake up. I don't hit the snooze, but I just don't wake up. I wake up and then I go back to bed. And I've had this problem forever and I could beat myself up about it or I could find a solution. And I finally found a solution and I have somebody who is basically my assistant. She lives in a different part of the world. So she's at a different time than we are here. And it just so happens that the time I want to wake up is a really easy time for her to call me on WhatsApp and say it's time to wake up. Now, I'm not proud that I need to have somebody to help me wake up. It's a little embarrassing. I have a little judgment about that. But I don't care because it works because I will never let that phone ring for more than two rings. Because I am not going to have somebody halfway across the world calling me and just me not paying attention. That is even more embarrassing. That's humiliating. That's and it's not respectful of her time. It's not so I'll disrespect my own time all day long. I'm not going to disrespect someone else's. So if you struggle with procrastination or letting yourself off the hook, well, you're human. That makes you normal. Now, find solutions for that. Get someone else. Even if it's you got to have your spouse wake you up at 5 a.m. or whatever time. You know what? Doesn't matter. Everyone's everyone's human. So just a little just a little you know, inside into my life where people go, wow, you do so many things. You must, you know, you really have it all figured out. I'm like, not really. I just have systems. It's same with you. You have systems. You know what you're doing every day. So anyway, my head is spinning from all of the great stuff that Nick mentioned. I want to open this up to our audience to let them know that Nick is excited to connect with you as well. So Nick provides content for agents. He's also, you know, just leading by example.
