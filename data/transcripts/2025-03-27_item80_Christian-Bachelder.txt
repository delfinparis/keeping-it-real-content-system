[00:01:19] Today's episode is brought to you by Corded.io.
[00:01:23] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team?
[00:01:27] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:31] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:34] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:36] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:39] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are
[00:01:44] looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also
[00:01:50] looking to leave you?
[00:01:51] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents.
[00:01:56] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:01] Corded.io looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and
[00:02:06] shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:09] Not only does it do that, but Corded.io went and visited my recruiting website and read
[00:02:14] everything I offer.
[00:02:16] So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:21] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:23] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:25] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:30] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, Corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:02:38] That's Corded.io.
[00:02:40] And now, onto the show.
[00:02:56] Today, on the show is a legend.
[00:02:59] We have Christian Batchelder from the one brokerage, which is a nationwide lending brokerage.
[00:03:05] I'm going to tell you more about Christian in a sec.
[00:03:08] Together with David Green, who, by the way, has been featured on our show, another legend.
[00:03:13] If you guys aren't familiar with Christian and David, bigger pockets is where they became
[00:03:19] very big celebrities in the influencers in the real estate world.
[00:03:25] They have podcasts and they just absolutely crushed it over there.
[00:03:29] Bigger pockets is an online community for real estate investors to congregate and talk
[00:03:35] and discuss and learn.
[00:03:37] And it's the number one platform for real estate investors.
[00:03:40] And these guys were kind of the face of the company for a lack of a better word.
[00:03:45] And so we are so excited to have Christian on the show.
[00:03:48] But let me tell you about Christian.
[00:03:49] Christian co-founded the one brokerage deemed the fastest growing broker in the nation.
[00:03:55] In 2021 and 2022 ranked in the top 20 brokerages by funded loan value.
[00:04:01] Christian is a UC Berkeley grad.
[00:04:03] He has a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering, but hated the industry and wanted to get out
[00:04:07] of capped earning potential.
[00:04:09] He got into real estate with the help of a childhood family friend who had some success
[00:04:13] in the business and discovered he had a knack for connecting with people and adding value
[00:04:17] to their mindsets, investments and journeys.
[00:04:20] He has a licensed real estate insurance, a real estate agent, insurance and mortgage broker.
[00:04:26] Bachelor regularly host masterminds, seminars and webinars with real estate groupers.
[00:04:32] He teaches, by the way, he teaches the teachers.
[00:04:34] He is that at that level.
[00:04:36] He teaches people everything from investing principles to how to buy your thousandth property
[00:04:41] with a focus on why what markets target, how to find the best loan, how to protect
[00:04:46] one's investments with insurance and other forms of asset protection.
[00:04:51] This guest speaker purchased 15 properties in 12 months last year employing the same
[00:04:56] principles he teaches.
[00:04:58] He created a course for one of his team role in to teach the fundamentals of the sales
[00:05:02] process, how to become the best advisor possible, how to get the most out of the career
[00:05:07] path and tips on succeeding in any market.
[00:05:10] I want everybody to go check out his brokerage.
[00:05:14] It is the one number one, the one brokerage.com will have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:05:18] Give him an opportunity on your next purchase.
[00:05:21] He would love to earn your business.
[00:05:23] Christian, welcome.
[00:05:25] Absolutely.
[00:05:25] I can't ask for much more in introduction.
[00:05:28] I appreciate all the kind words that I hopefully, in the same way we ran our business and
[00:05:32] kind of the mentality that we approach everything with.
[00:05:34] Hopefully I can bring some value to you, your listeners and everybody who may be tuning
[00:05:38] in today.
[00:05:39] You guys are legends.
[00:05:41] You took bigger pockets, podcasts to the very top of the charts and it's probably still
[00:05:48] at the top of the charts.
[00:05:49] It is the number one place people go to learn about real estate investing, agents and lay
[00:05:55] people alike.
[00:05:57] Our audience are agents and so they want to hear all about what's going on in the
[00:06:02] lending world.
[00:06:02] You are in the middle of it.
[00:06:05] You are right in the smack dab middle of what's going on.
[00:06:10] We always can talk about rates and people do want to talk about that, I guess.
[00:06:15] We really just want to talk about how do we keep our business rolling.
[00:06:18] Whatever the rates are doing, we saw that last year, the last two Fed cuts, rates didn't
[00:06:25] move.
[00:06:26] Lending rates didn't move with the Fed cuts, which is really interesting.
[00:06:30] We can talk about that as well.
[00:06:31] I want to get into your story.
[00:06:32] Let's learn about you.
[00:06:34] Tell us about how did you get into the real estate business?
[00:06:37] Yeah, I understand.
[00:06:38] As you shared, I'll start off graduating from UC Berkeley.
[00:06:43] I was very fortunate to have a stellar education.
[00:06:45] My mom slaved away for more days than she needed to make that happen for me and that's my
[00:06:53] ultimate appreciation for us and foremost.
[00:06:56] But I made a stupid decision.
[00:06:57] I went majored in something I didn't enjoy.
[00:06:58] I was good at it.
[00:06:59] I was skilled.
[00:07:00] I was talented.
[00:07:01] But I couldn't sit in front of a lab computer all day typing in algorithms of chemical formula
[00:07:07] and code and everything else.
[00:07:10] I dabbed a little bit in the industry.
[00:07:12] I did some internships.
[00:07:13] Just couldn't find something.
[00:07:16] I was raised in a, maybe some listeners have some adherence to this.
[00:07:21] I was raised in a house where you went for the sciences and there's not other options.
[00:07:26] My grandpa was a doctor.
[00:07:27] My mom's a nurse.
[00:07:28] My uncle's a surgeon.
[00:07:30] Pretty much success to me was synonymous with the science industry, healthcare, stuff
[00:07:35] like that.
[00:07:35] Sure.
[00:07:37] I didn't know you could major in business.
[00:07:39] That sounds so short-sighted now.
[00:07:41] I didn't know you could even do that.
[00:07:42] Because my family was so just set in their ways.
[00:07:46] So after graduating, I realized, oh, the richest person I know owns a gas station.
[00:07:53] That's kind of weird.
[00:07:54] That's not what my family told.
[00:07:55] I think the doctor should be a richest person I know.
[00:07:57] Doctors and lawyers.
[00:07:58] That you should be, right?
[00:08:01] But then I started really just going around and asking people and one of my buddies
[00:08:04] growing up, he always had a new car when we were growing up.
[00:08:08] He always had the coolest new toy, the new cell phone, the new whatever.
[00:08:13] I wasn't super wealthy growing up for a period of my childhood.
[00:08:16] I was on food stamps, I believe it or not.
[00:08:19] Before my mom got her nursing job.
[00:08:22] So I just went and asked him, what do you do?
[00:08:25] And turns out he was in real estate.
[00:08:28] He did some investments that were out of the country.
[00:08:30] He was proven so he had some investments in Peru.
[00:08:33] But he opened up a brokerage in America, right?
[00:08:35] And real estate and the lending brokerage, helping people find property and finance it.
[00:08:39] And he was also an insurance broker.
[00:08:41] And funny, you can kind of see why I decided to be what I did.
[00:08:45] And he realized that, hey, there's a need for the financial service industry.
[00:08:48] And he targeted, you know, mainly a Hispanic database, right?
[00:08:53] So people who couldn't necessarily go into a bank and get the normal loans.
[00:08:57] They didn't communicate with the banker very well.
[00:08:59] They didn't understand not only a language barrier, but just kind of the culture.
[00:09:04] 
[00:09:04] They trusted him, though.
[00:09:07] He was kind of like the hefe, right?
[00:09:10] And so I got to see a very unique perspective.
[00:09:13] I fell in love with it.
[00:09:14] I fell in love with being able to understand real estate and understand finances in a way
[00:09:18] that I never took a finance class in college.
[00:09:20] You know, I didn't know what an interest rate was.
[00:09:22] You know, I didn't know really anything.
[00:09:26] So kind of had a whole, you know, brave new world open up to me.
[00:09:31] And just like I said, fell in love with it.
[00:09:33] Fell in love with being able to help people find, you know, the new investment
[00:09:37] or even their first primary residence, you know, helping them get out of renting
[00:09:40] and start building up some equity and realize home ownership.
[00:09:43] You know, then obviously packaging all the other services of assisting with financing
[00:09:46] and even protecting it via insurance, right?
[00:09:49] And going to one place kind of my dream was what this is kind of coalesced into now.
[00:09:55] Going to one place that you can get the advice of everywhere, right?
[00:09:58] You don't have to go to a farmers or a state farm and then go to a RE/MAX
[00:10:01] and then go to a chase to get a mortgage and then go over here to get a property
[00:10:05] management company and then go over here to get tax advice.
[00:10:08] The long term goal of the one brokerage is to be the one brokerage for everything you need, right?
[00:10:14] And while we're still working on aspects of it, the property management, the tax prep,
[00:10:17] all that, our lending really, really, really took off because I think arguably that's one of the
[00:10:25] biggest needs in the industry, right? Everything's important, but you can't buy anything without
[00:10:30] financing, right? And it's a lot of times it is much more complicated than what you see online,
[00:10:37] right? And there's a lot of people that say a lot of stuff like they know what they're doing and it's
[00:10:42] you know, being in it now for as long as I have being fortunate enough to work with the types of
[00:10:46] people. Like you said, I've definitely found myself in the position of advising the advisors,
[00:10:52] right? The gurus and the course providers are usually calling me and to host my portion of their
[00:10:57] course. And that's not a dig to them at all. That's that's absolute, you know, appreciation that I
[00:11:05] have for them and being able to put me in those positions. Yeah, no, you're you have a legendary
[00:11:11] reputation and somebody who is often sought after to get their opinion and their perspective on
[00:11:18] not just how to be a better loan officer or real estate agent, but also just what's going on in
[00:11:23] the industry. And right now, you know, I think we're dealing, we were talking about this just
[00:11:28] before we went on alive, which was, you know, we have this inventory issue. We just don't have much,
[00:11:34] there's not much out there. Part of that I think is due to the refinance that happened,
[00:11:39] you know, the big refinance boom that obviously all of us remember from several years, many years ago.
[00:11:44] And, you know, we are all locked into these lower interest rates that we, you know, don't want to leave.
[00:11:50] And also we get to work from home now for a lot of us. So there's that piece of it too. So we have,
[00:11:56] you know, all of this going on yet in the last year was the 30, the lowest home sales 30 years,
[00:12:07] believe it or not. So we had, we have just have a lot, lot happening. Tell me what you think's going
[00:12:13] on right now and what you would do. Yeah, we were, we were chatting a little bit about this before,
[00:12:18] and it's, it's going to be able to put this out there now. And just on the, on the kind of number
[00:12:22] side of what you're saying, we're, you know, we were all time lows, you know, inventory and sales,
[00:12:27] just in my industry alone, in loan officers, I believe going back to 2021, if you compare the
[00:12:33] license loan officers from then till now, about 80% of them have left the industry. So, yeah, I saw
[00:12:39] that or out of five loan officers that were here during COVID are gone, which is crazy to think about.
[00:12:44] I mean, a name another industry that in four years has an 80% withdrawal from that's wild, right?
[00:12:50] But taking that aside, what I think I have kind of a unique take on this. And I, I got a little
[00:12:57] bit of pushback on bigger pockets for saying this because it could be coded as maybe fear mongering,
[00:13:01] not how I intend this, but I'll do a little mental exercise with all listeners. Go back to your
[00:13:07] childhood. Who did you know that owned multiple homes? I didn't know anybody, right? My grandma owned
[00:13:13] it. My grandma owned a house. My mom didn't yet when I was a kid, but you know, I had like an uncle
[00:13:18] who owned a house, right? Like, you know, people who had long term jobs, but like nobody was investing
[00:13:23] in Florida or investing in the smokies or I live in California. So that's like across, you know,
[00:13:27] the country, even like going up and buying maybe I had a friend who owned like a vacation cabin
[00:13:33] in Tahoe or mammoth or big bear, you know, something that you go to once or twice a year.
[00:13:38] People weren't buying like rentals though, right? And of course, there were. It was just much,
[00:13:43] much fewer and farther between, right? And everybody that I asked this, most people say, no, yeah,
[00:13:49] I can't really remember anybody that had like a portfolio when I was a kid, right? Sure. And I think with
[00:13:55] the surge of accessibility of advice, bigger pockets, your show podcast, just the ease
[00:14:04] that getting advice can come with now. You know, a lot of people go take a course, right? From some
[00:14:11] guru, some provider, whatever, right? I'd learn how to invest in real estate and they can learn
[00:14:16] cap rates and NOIs and interest rates and how to invest and what the out payments you need and
[00:14:20] what loan product you need. You're probably hearing somebody like me in that course, discussing
[00:14:23] different loan products, right? That just wasn't around before, right? If you wanted a loan,
[00:14:28] you would go to Washington Mutual, right? Which is, yeah, those who remember, that was pre-chase,
[00:14:33] right? Or you'd go, you'd go to your bank of America, you go to Wells Fargo and like,
[00:14:36] that's how you got a mortgage before, right? And most times they didn't like giving you
[00:14:40] mortgages that were for a house across the country, right? So I think what we're witnessing is a
[00:14:47] combination of multiple factors. Obviously, the interest rates have a have a say, of course.
[00:14:52] That led to the golden handcuffs where people just don't want to get out, you know, people who
[00:14:56] qualified at 3% just don't qualify for a comparable home at 7%. So they stay put, right? So there's
[00:15:01] an objective barrier of leaving there that a lot of homeowners are in. On top of that,
[00:15:07] we have a lack of building and that's, I think, arguably the most important thing. If any of you guys
[00:15:16] have built, I've dabbled with it. I've helped a lot of clients with fixed and flipped loans or
[00:15:21] ran up construction loans, whatever it is. It is a nightmare to get through the legal loop holes
[00:15:26] and the city and council and zoning and ordinance and everything you have to go through to build
[00:15:31] anything, right? That's hard. Obviously, on top of that, the cost, right? You know, lumbering
[00:15:38] with all these tariffs and everything going on now, you know, we get most of our lumber from Canada.
[00:15:43] It's not getting cheaper. It's not getting cheaper. Right? So when you put all these things together,
[00:15:49] yes, obviously you have a recipe for something that was easy to get prior becoming harder. But when
[00:15:55] you also combine that with, you're no longer competing with people in your neighborhood.
[00:16:02] You're competing with the Californian, buying a rental property. You're competing with BlackRock.
[00:16:07] You're completing with these institutional buyers that 20 years ago, 30 years ago, 40 years ago,
[00:16:12] didn't exist. They weren't doing this, right? Even myself, I own 20, something single-family homes
[00:16:20] now. Like I'm a competitor for people in Florida in Tennessee and North Carolina and Arizona.
[00:16:24] I don't live there, right? 30 years ago, I would have not been anywhere near them. And now I wouldn't
[00:16:28] have had access. 100%. Right? I wouldn't have known how to get a property management. I wouldn't
[00:16:32] have known how to run an Airbnb. I'm a short-term rental investor for those curious. You know, I wouldn't
[00:16:37] have known how to finance that. Like, yeah, it wouldn't have been an option. And now, I think what
[00:16:43] we're witnessing is a significant consolidation of real estate, not necessarily a crash, not necessarily
[00:16:49] anything like that. I think, and I'll say my very, you know, kind of edgy thing here that I said
[00:16:58] on bigger pockets, I'm under the assumption that if you don't buy real estate in the next five to
[00:17:02] 10 years, I'm not sure you will be able to after that as somebody who doesn't own real estate. And
[00:17:07] that's not fear-mongering. That's not me pressure-staling you. That's not me saying, you know, please go
[00:17:13] do this so I can make a commission. None of that. Even if I wasn't in the industry, I see signs
[00:17:18] that if they're not turned around, so if there's not laws that go into place that limit these
[00:17:23] big institutional buyers or, you know, different tax brackets for these types of things,
[00:17:29] I think they're just going to keep doing it. And I think people like me are going to keep doing it
[00:17:32] because it is the best investment that I see available to make. I love real estate. I believe in it.
[00:17:38] I believe it builds generational wealth and I want my kids to have it. And I think the people
[00:17:44] doing it are going to continue doing it. And eventually it will reach a breaking point where we're
[00:17:48] not building as fast as the investors can buy. And that leaves nothing left for your first time home
[00:17:53] buyer. And that's kind of a frightful time. And you guys hear, you know, things like Blackwark saying,
[00:17:59] you'll, you know, you'll own nothing and be happy. I wouldn't be like, that's not me. You know,
[00:18:04] like I'm going to, I'm going to get a piece of the pie, right? And I recommend if you guys are
[00:18:08] sitting on the fence, rates are hard, qualifying is hard. 100%. Talk to a lender, find a way to do it.
[00:18:16] Most people can, whether it's getting a co-signer, whether it's qualifying as a household, whether it's
[00:18:20] selling something else you have, because if you want to buy real estate, the longer you wait, the
[00:18:25] harder it's going to get. And I firmly, right now there's a little bit of an opportunity, although I
[00:18:32] hate to even use the word opportunity because it's, it's, it technically is, but it's not a super
[00:18:38] attractive opportunity. But because there's not much inventory, there's not much competition. So in
[00:18:44] that sense, you might be getting things that a bit of a discount right now. So I think that's what
[00:18:48] REALTORS ought to be having conversations with two, they're, they're clients really talking about
[00:18:54] what do you want to do in the next couple of years? Do you want to move? Now might be the time,
[00:18:58] yes, you're going to give up, if you're a current homeowner, you're going to give up that 3% rate,
[00:19:02] but you're maybe going to get, and you're going to double that rate potentially, or more,
[00:19:07] more than double it. But, you know, eventually you'll be able to refi that down, but you can,
[00:19:15] maybe even, you'll have a lot less competition. Yeah, that's making, I mean, if anybody was buying
[00:19:20] during COVID, I was in that category. You guys remember you weren't buying anything and asking,
[00:19:26] you weren't buying anything, you know, with good terms for you. Yes, the interest rates were nice,
[00:19:30] but you were overpaying for things, right? And now, you know, like you mentioned, there is,
[00:19:34] there is an opportunity to get stuff, you know, at market value, probably even below market value,
[00:19:37] you get some seller credit, save on closing costs, buy your rate down, you know, there's,
[00:19:41] there's much more opportunity for that now. It's still not easy. I don't want to, I'm not trying to
[00:19:47] create a facade here. It's a difficult time to invest in real estate. I think it's a difficult time,
[00:19:52] just economically for our country right now, right? Kind of no matter what sector you're in.
[00:19:56] And I think real estate provides a unique opportunity that a lot of other things don't,
[00:20:01] you know, and it's, it's, when you look at, you know, comparing real estate to the stock market,
[00:20:07] comparing real estate to a 401k or in almost every scenario, it's hard to make an argument against
[00:20:13] right? Especially when you take advantage of low down payment options and, you know, refinancing
[00:20:18] when the rates get good, you know, I learned this the other day, you know, in most countries,
[00:20:21] you can't refinance a lot of people don't know this. So the word mortgage, it means I believe it
[00:20:27] means a death packed. That's what it means death or a death pledge. I think it means death pledge.
[00:20:32] Because the word mortgage was intended to stay there till you die. Now in America, we have a 30
[00:20:37] or more years, which obviously is until you die. But I was talking to somebody who I think was
[00:20:42] Spanish or Italian and he said, what is refinance? Like, what does that mean? And I'm like,
[00:20:46] oh, that's whenever it's beneficial for you, you can tell the lender are deals off. I want a new one.
[00:20:51] And he's like, can the lender do that to you? I'd love the rates to go up. I'm like, I've never
[00:20:57] been asked that what? No, the lender can't do that to you. He's like, that's not fair. I'm like,
[00:21:02] I've never heard somebody, you know, think about it this way. I'm like, yeah, I guess that's not
[00:21:06] fair for the bank, but it's fair for us. He's like, oh my God, I want to invest in America.
[00:21:09] When we get alone where I'm from, like, you can't refinance. There's no such thing.
[00:21:13] And I thought that was so interesting. I'm like, wow, we take the little things like that. We
[00:21:16] take for granted. Right? It's like everybody went and got a 3% rate during COVID.
[00:21:21] That's because of the way the American financial system set up. You know, you could go spur your last
[00:21:25] lender that had you at a 6% and you could go, you know, pair up with one that's at 3 and put
[00:21:30] yourself in a much better financial position. Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. I think there's
[00:21:35] two, there's the there is an opportunity for agents who really because we know that home value
[00:21:41] prices have gone up, right? So over the last five years, if you sold somebody at home, odds are
[00:21:47] the value has appreciated to some degree. So they're going to be happy with you. They're going to
[00:21:51] like you. They're going to be grateful that they made that investment. And you just got to get
[00:21:57] them over that sort of lending or the lending rate hurdle. But understand that, you know, you'd
[00:22:02] date the rate you marry the house, right? That's always been the for primary residents, for sure.
[00:22:07] Yeah, 100% and I mean, I we kind of we preach a pretty cool investing strategy that I think a lot
[00:22:14] of agents would be would be really really benefited by knowing this. We preach the one house
[00:22:20] of your strategy, which is what it sounds like, obviously, it's one house you buy one house a year,
[00:22:26] right? But the idea is it's a replacement to your typical 401k or your typical IRA, right? So the
[00:22:31] people that are doing, you know, your three to eight percent 401k and IRA contributions every year,
[00:22:36] take that aside and you can put that as a three to five percent down payment on a new home and you
[00:22:40] move primary residences every year. Now the thought process is, oh, well, now I don't have a retirement.
[00:22:48] Well, if you had your 401k, you tap into it when you're what 65, whatever it is, right? You start
[00:22:54] paying some taxes at that point, which you think taxes are going to be higher or lower when you're 65,
[00:22:58] probably higher, right? But regardless, even if you're in some tax benefit,
[00:23:02] the benefit of the account, if you're buying a house every year and you do that for the next
[00:23:06] 15 to 20 years and you put them on, you know, let's say 30 year notes and you start this at 35,
[00:23:13] that means you end when you're 65. Your first year of retirement when you're 65, you have the very
[00:23:19] first house you bought paid off and full now because you've extended 30 years, you paid off
[00:23:24] well, you can go do a cash out refinance and that's tax-free and that's a rental property now
[00:23:31] paying for itself and I, what do you think of $500,000 houses worth 30 years from now?
[00:23:36] $3 million maybe? Something crazy. Yeah. So you go cash out $2.5 million
[00:23:40] retirement and boom, you have your first year of income in retirement, $2.5 million tax-free.
[00:23:48] Amazing. And what happens in your 31? Well, now my second house I bought is paid off.
[00:23:54] You want $2.5 million again or you want to hold off with your first $2.5 million?
[00:23:58] Okay, well let's subsidize your retirement now by financing the real estate that you bought
[00:24:02] over the course of 30 years, never putting down more than 5% because you just did a primary
[00:24:07] residence every year. Now that's uncomfortable. You have to move a lot but when you look at that
[00:24:14] return of millions of dollars a year of tax-free in your retirement, I know a lot of people who take
[00:24:19] that deal. You know, I would take that deal. 100%. So getting into real estate investing can be
[00:24:26] a lot easier and people think people think they need a huge amount of money. You don't in a lot of
[00:24:30] cases. You need to be able to qualify for these loans and that's the hard part right now.
[00:24:36] So talking to a lender, you know, if an agent's listed this, have your borrower, talk to a lender,
[00:24:42] have you talked to a lender, talk through solutions that they can come. Oh, we need to seize your
[00:24:46] earnings a little longer. We need to, you know, get a higher paying job. We need to add your sister
[00:24:50] or your girlfriend on to here that can qualify with you. Maybe your parents can co-sign.
[00:24:55] There's always a creative solution, right? Just starting the conversation is what most people never
[00:25:02] get to the point of though. So let's, yeah, let's break that process down again because I'm very
[00:25:08] fascinated by this. So essentially what we're doing is we're moving every year, we're finding a new
[00:25:13] property that we like and walk us through kind of how that works. Yeah. So let's say, I mean,
[00:25:19] let's just say we have a household income of $100,000 a year, right? Two people making 50K,
[00:25:24] pretty average, right? So let's say that those people would be, I think most people would put about
[00:25:31] 15% into retirement. They try, right? So 15 grand is going into retirement. I'm saying instead of
[00:25:37] that, yeah, if you took 15 grand that first year, you've worked one year. Good job. You've saved
[00:25:42] incredible. Take 15 grand and put 3% down on a new primary residence. That's $500,000 property.
[00:25:49] That will buy you a starter home in most markets in America. If you're in San Francisco, it's not,
[00:25:53] but you're also probably 100 grand, you're probably not making San Francisco. So it skills with the
[00:25:57] area, right? You go put 3% down for your first home, you buy a property, you try to flint that
[00:26:05] mortgage, you try to get comfortable with the payments. It's probably more than you're going to
[00:26:08] pay in rent right now, but that's what we got. Okay? The second year, that $500,000 property,
[00:26:15] maybe it's worth 510 or 520 now, right? There's something in some amount of appreciation. Great. Leave
[00:26:19] it alone. You now move with your next $15,000 that you made, maybe you got a little bit of a raise
[00:26:24] at work set that money aside. Let's say we have 20,000. In year two, we're buying a new house,
[00:26:30] leaving our old one and converting it to a rental property. You can think of this intelligently,
[00:26:35] maybe you target a multi-family, maybe you target a condo, something that can rent for close to
[00:26:40] what the mortgage is, right? Even if it's a small loss, that's okay. So in year two, now you have one
[00:26:45] property that's basically cash flow neutral, and you have your new property that you just moved into.
[00:26:50] And you put a grand total of 15 and let's call it 20, $35,000 down and you bought a million dollars
[00:26:56] of real estate. That's pretty cool, right? Yeah. I didn't think $50,000 could buy me a million
[00:27:03] dollars in real estate. That sounds incredible. Cool. And now you copy and paste. And if you do that
[00:27:08] every year, your rents are going up. If ever a COVID comes again, you take your entire portfolio and
[00:27:14] refinance it down. All the 7% rates now turn into fours or fives, right? And you keep that portfolio
[00:27:20] and you just keep paying that mortgage, keep paying it, keep paying it, keep paying it, keep paying.
[00:27:24] Remember, I took away your retirement, so you don't have that, right? So at some point,
[00:27:30] you're going to want to cash out of your investments. If you were in stocks, that means you're selling
[00:27:35] the stock, if it was retirement, that means you're withdrawing and you're paying whatever fees or
[00:27:39] taxes or deferred that you have at that point. In real estate, that means you're leveraging or selling.
[00:27:45] 30 years down the line, we follow the same trajectory. The first property we bought, now is 100% paid off.
[00:27:52] We leverage it. Or you sell it. You can sell a property every year in your retirement if you want.
[00:27:56] Then you get the full equity, right? And you guys can imagine if you
[00:28:01] track back here, what 30 years ago would have been, what, 95? What could you buy houses for in your
[00:28:10] area, 90, 95? 300,000? Yeah, I'd say even less than that. I mean, I know, I know some people were buying,
[00:28:18] I mean, my grandma bought her house for $40,000. It's worth like 3 million now. Granted, she was on
[00:28:25] like a dirt road that's now all been developed. So that's a unique one. But sure, a couple hundred
[00:28:29] thousand dollars, right? Those properties aren't worth that now. And you put 5% down of 100,
[00:28:35] $200, 300,000. And now you're sitting on $2 million in equity in your retirement and you did that
[00:28:41] for 30 years. There's not a way that fails. Even if one of those properties, like you have to
[00:28:49] fix somebody and you're way cash flow negative, once you start building it up, they're supporting each
[00:28:55] other, right? Like you're going to be okay, right? And eventually you can start cutting into the
[00:29:02] money that you're paying on rent anyway. So like your primary residence is always going to be an
[00:29:06] expense. You can build it up to the point where your rentals cover your primary, you start living
[00:29:10] for free. That's where you get into multi-family and house hacking, depending on how uncomfortable you
[00:29:14] want to be. But the mindset is still replace. What I think is one of the biggest cons in America is
[00:29:21] the 401k with something that actually puts you ahead. Right? Yeah, it's super interesting.
[00:29:29] Makes a ton of sense. And my mind is spinning because I need to start building up my portfolio as well.
[00:29:36] Because you're absolutely right, you know, markets go up and down. Obviously stock market does
[00:29:41] raise over time. If we think the average 401k is probably going to average, I don't know,
[00:29:46] seven to nine percent a year over time per year. It's not bad. Pretty decent, you know,
[00:29:51] double your money every 10 years or so. That's good investment. But you're also at the, you're
[00:29:58] also really at the mercy of whatever is happening at that time when you need that money. And the idea
[00:30:05] of building a home portfolio or investment portfolio of real estate is particularly interesting
[00:30:13] because we see the trends of home buying trends have gone down. Right? We've seen less younger people
[00:30:19] in particular, they're buying homes later. I think the average home first time home buyer last year
[00:30:25] was 38 years old. And that was up from like 35 the year before. So people are buying homes later.
[00:30:32] They're renting a lot longer. So this, this is a huge opportunity. I just think people also,
[00:30:38] because of the, I think it's the work from home thing that's been so much of the catalyst for this,
[00:30:43] because people can be a little bit more nomadic. They can go. They can, they can go from here to there
[00:30:47] and are all connected with technology. So there's this ability to like all of here for a little while,
[00:30:52] that all of there for a little while. And I'll just kind of sprint across the country, renting and,
[00:30:56] and you know, there's a lot of advantages to renting too, which is you get better stuff usually.
[00:31:03] I'm a weird example of this. I don't, I don't own where I currently, you guys probably tell my background
[00:31:07] here. I'm in an apartment. I have a portfolio of 20 plus properties and I don't own where I live
[00:31:12] personally because I'm exactly like you said, I travel a lot. I like to get around. I don't like
[00:31:16] having a big mortgage when I'm not there. You know, I get to buy new stuff every year. A lot of
[00:31:21] times my places come furnished. Right? I didn't buy this furniture behind me. Or I came with the
[00:31:26] apartment. It's obvious. I don't, I live very lightly. Right? Now that's not the right move for
[00:31:31] everybody. Right? Those people who are building a family and, you know, building a relationship.
[00:31:35] They want a place that they can call home base. But if you can fit into that category where, you know,
[00:31:41] you can supremely, I mean, I'm paying a tenth here, what I would pay for a house in my area.
[00:31:46] Right? And I still get to live all my family and friends. I still get all the cool amenities of
[00:31:50] living in sunny SoCal. And I'm paying less than what? Less than about 24 hundred bucks a month
[00:31:58] in this place that if I was owning a property, same thing with three bedrooms and in a backyard,
[00:32:04] I'm paying eight, nine grand a month in a mortgage. Right? Crazy. And that money instead is going
[00:32:10] to my investments. I'm doing it. I'm practicing what I preach. I'm doing the same thing where I'm
[00:32:14] buying rentals every year. Right? And my goal is in 30, 35, 40 years whenever I finally
[00:32:22] decided to call it quits. There's going to be a very good opportunity there to leverage subsidize
[00:32:26] my retirement and ultimately have have a really cool, really cool thing to pass down to whoever comes
[00:32:31] after me. Right? Yeah, I think agents who are not sort of thinking about the strategy as a
[00:32:39] education piece to bring to your clients, you're really missing an opportunity here because
[00:32:44] you can just crunch the numbers. I mean, heck, just go to chat GPT and ask them to explain this to you.
[00:32:49] Chat GPT, I'll explain it to you very effectively as well. And you can even practice your pitch
[00:32:54] with chat GPT as well. But the idea is that, you know, people are always looking for investment
[00:33:00] opportunities. The markets, obviously great financial advisors will can handle all of that stuff.
[00:33:05] But you now have this opportunity to bring a second sort of stream of income. And,
[00:33:08] you know, also too, you know, 401k is do not provide a steady stream of income along the way.
[00:33:13] There's tax benefits, of course, on the way out. Sure. But are along the way and on the way out. But
[00:33:18] but I like the idea of having my money work for me today. And so, you know, there's there's this
[00:33:26] thing that, you know, it's really funny. Like we have to live somewhere. We all have to live somewhere.
[00:33:31] So you're either going to be renting or buying everyone's always going to be renting or buying.
[00:33:34] And there's a trend towards more renting. Now, what does that mean for the real estate agent
[00:33:39] industry? I don't know. I hope it continues to be flourish and I guess we'll see. But you want to
[00:33:47] obviously bring these opportunities to your clients because they're going to learn about it anyway.
[00:33:51] Yeah. And it would be the person that does it. And, you know, tell us, tell us about your brokerage.
[00:33:55] Why did you build your own brokerage? Yeah, yeah, good question. Really. So I actually started out as a
[00:34:00] real estate agent. Did that for quite a while and then I realized I was sending referrals to, you
[00:34:07] know, a lender that wasn't doing a good job. So I said, okay, let me see how hard that is. Right?
[00:34:11] Let's see what that's about. Start a mortgage brokerage. After that realized, hey, there's
[00:34:16] insurance on the other side of that and in the same format that my, my quote unquote mentor had set
[00:34:20] up for me when I started. I said, hey, I can do all this. This makes sense. Now I'm solely focused
[00:34:28] on the lending aspect. But I started it because I once again, there was just, there was a need,
[00:34:33] right? When I would talk to people, showing them houses, you know, doing that ever,
[00:34:37] they wouldn't know how to discuss, how do I budget this? What is my monthly payment going to be?
[00:34:42] What's my interest rate? What if I, can I refinance in the future? What if I want to add an ADU?
[00:34:47] What would the rental income be for that? You know, and there were just so many questions that I
[00:34:50] saw such an opportunity there to answer that I honestly became the brokerage, you know, the,
[00:34:57] the roles that I have today because I was curious. Like I was going and seeking out those answers.
[00:35:03] And as I found them, I wanted to turn around and give them to customers, right?
[00:35:09] So really, I became a mortgage broker because I was getting mortgages.
[00:35:12] Right? I was starting to get interested in my property and I, I was fascinated by the industry and
[00:35:17] I thought there was a, there was a supreme lack in what was available, whether it was online or
[00:35:23] in the community or just what I saw, you know, with my family, right? My family didn't know.
[00:35:27] They thought, oh, you go to Chase to get a loan. Well, Chase only does, you know,
[00:35:32] primary, this and very clean cut investment loans. And I would hear, you know, I was,
[00:35:37] I would listen to bigger pockets before I was on it. And he's just saying, like, how are these
[00:35:41] guys aren't getting loans at Chase? Chase wouldn't give David Green a loan. He's got 85 single-family
[00:35:47] homes in Jacksonville. He's way past the conventional loan limit, right? And that's where I started
[00:35:53] to realize there's a whole wonderful world, right? Behind the scenes of lending that, once I started
[00:35:59] realizing was there, I couldn't help but share it, right? Yeah, it's, it's so great. And, you know,
[00:36:07] we're so excited to have you on the show. And we really want to bring this to our audience to think
[00:36:12] about not just for yourself, but obviously for your clients. Like, this is a real opportunity for
[00:36:17] to build up, build equity, build retirement. And I'm excited about it because I need to do this as well.
[00:36:25] I do not always have confidence as much confidence in the stock market as I, well, number one,
[00:36:31] I'm not picking individual stocks. I stopped doing that a million years ago. But I just, you know,
[00:36:37] I have no control over that. I have literally no control over what happens to my investments. And I
[00:36:41] am diversified in the stock market, like all of us probably are. And that's good. And we should also
[00:36:47] have other streams of income too. So this is a great opportunity to bring to your home buyers,
[00:36:52] even if they're just primary resident people and they don't want to move. But okay, hey,
[00:36:56] maybe consider saving a little bit more, investing in property and just kind of running the numbers.
[00:37:01] And somebody like Christian can actually help you on the lending side of it. You can also explain
[00:37:06] how it works. And I jump in on intro calls with REALTORS and their clients all the time. Like,
[00:37:12] all the time, I don't just have to talk to your agent. I don't just have to talk to you. Let's all get
[00:37:15] together. We'll plan out a method of plan of attack together, right? Like, is this possible in
[00:37:20] the market you're searching it? Right? The agent can answer that better than I can. Like, I'm not a
[00:37:25] master in, we're a nationwide lender. I'm not a master in every zip code in America. But I can tell
[00:37:29] you what the bar work and qualify for and then you can kind of guide them to where that will work.
[00:37:34] Yeah, I love that. And the one brokerage.com is where you go to learn all about Christian and
[00:37:40] everything that they offer for real estate investments, also primary residents as well. They're
[00:37:45] licensed and all over, they can do loans all over the country. So definitely reach out to them.
[00:37:52] They are amazing. They're fantastic. And you also follow Christian on Instagram. It's the
[00:37:57] underscore one underscore broker. So the one broker with two underscores there. I will have a link
[00:38:03] to both of those in the show notes. But do us a favor. Check out his website. Check out his lending.
[00:38:09] Talk to him. Have him educate you so that you can educate your clients and keep your business
[00:38:16] rolling. Because again, if Christian is right and the real estate market continues to get gobbled up
[00:38:21] by institutional investors over the years, which we see no sign of that slowing down, we are going
[00:38:27] to have a shortage, right? We're going to have problems. We don't have issues. And so you want to
[00:38:33] start investing as quickly as possible. And certainly making the at least the pitch or the
[00:38:38] educational pitch to your clients and yourself have this conversation. It's really fun. It's
[00:38:44] exciting. And you don't also have to get those 2 a.m. phone calls as a property manager. There are
[00:38:49] solutions to that as well. So you don't don't have to worry about every part of that because
[00:38:54] obviously there's lots of services that can support that. But yeah, Christian, we're going to
[00:38:59] continue to obviously have you on every month. We're going to talk about this. We're going to
[00:39:02] educate our audience. And guys, bring us your questions. Let us know what you'd like Christian to
[00:39:07] talk about in particular around investing, running lending. You know, what are the creative strategies
[00:39:13] that are working for him and his clients? We want to hear from you. What are your clients asking
[00:39:18] you guys about? We will answer those on this show. So as always, when everybody to support Christian,
[00:39:26] go to the onebrokerage.com. Also, please tell a friend about this podcast, every real estate agent

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded.io looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but Corded.io went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, Corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit Corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's Corded.io. And now, onto the show. Today, on the show is a legend. We have Christian Batchelder from the one brokerage, which is a nationwide lending brokerage. I'm going to tell you more about Christian in a sec. Together with David Green, who, by the way, has been featured on our show, another legend. If you guys aren't familiar with Christian and David, bigger pockets is where they became very big celebrities in the influencers in the real estate world. They have podcasts and they just absolutely crushed it over there. Bigger pockets is an online community for real estate investors to congregate and talk and discuss and learn. And it's the number one platform for real estate investors. And these guys were kind of the face of the company for a lack of a better word. And so we are so excited to have Christian on the show. But let me tell you about Christian. Christian co-founded the one brokerage deemed the fastest growing broker in the nation. In 2021 and 2022 ranked in the top 20 brokerages by funded loan value. Christian is a UC Berkeley grad. He has a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering, but hated the industry and wanted to get out of capped earning potential. He got into real estate with the help of a childhood family friend who had some success in the business and discovered he had a knack for connecting with people and adding value to their mindsets, investments and journeys. He has a licensed real estate insurance, a real estate agent, insurance and mortgage broker. Bachelor regularly host masterminds, seminars and webinars with real estate groupers. He teaches, by the way, he teaches the teachers. He is that at that level. He teaches people everything from investing principles to how to buy your thousandth property with a focus on why what markets target, how to find the best loan, how to protect one's investments with insurance and other forms of asset protection. This guest speaker purchased 15 properties in 12 months last year employing the same principles he teaches. He created a course for one of his team role in to teach the fundamentals of the sales process, how to become the best advisor possible, how to get the most out of the career path and tips on succeeding in any market. I want everybody to go check out his brokerage. It is the one number one, the one brokerage.com will have a link to that in the show notes. Give him an opportunity on your next purchase. He would love to earn your business. Christian, welcome. Absolutely. I can't ask for much more in introduction. I appreciate all the kind words that I hopefully, in the same way we ran our business and kind of the mentality that we approach everything with. Hopefully I can bring some value to you, your listeners and everybody who may be tuning in today. You guys are legends. You took bigger pockets, podcasts to the very top of the charts and it's probably still at the top of the charts. It is the number one place people go to learn about real estate investing, agents and lay people alike. Our audience are agents and so they want to hear all about what's going on in the lending world. You are in the middle of it. You are right in the smack dab middle of what's going on. We always can talk about rates and people do want to talk about that, I guess. We really just want to talk about how do we keep our business rolling. Whatever the rates are doing, we saw that last year, the last two Fed cuts, rates didn't move. Lending rates didn't move with the Fed cuts, which is really interesting. We can talk about that as well. I want to get into your story. Let's learn about you. Tell us about how did you get into the real estate business? Yeah, I understand. As you shared, I'll start off graduating from UC Berkeley. I was very fortunate to have a stellar education. My mom slaved away for more days than she needed to make that happen for me and that's my ultimate appreciation for us and foremost. But I made a stupid decision. I went majored in something I didn't enjoy. I was good at it. I was skilled. I was talented. But I couldn't sit in front of a lab computer all day typing in algorithms of chemical formula and code and everything else. I dabbed a little bit in the industry. I did some internships. Just couldn't find something. I was raised in a, maybe some listeners have some adherence to this. I was raised in a house where you went for the sciences and there's not other options. My grandpa was a doctor. My mom's a nurse. My uncle's a surgeon. Pretty much success to me was synonymous with the science industry, healthcare, stuff like that. Sure. I didn't know you could major in business. That sounds so short-sighted now. I didn't know you could even do that. Because my family was so just set in their ways. So after graduating, I realized, oh, the richest person I know owns a gas station. That's kind of weird. That's not what my family told. I think the doctor should be a richest person I know. Doctors and lawyers. That you should be, right? But then I started really just going around and asking people and one of my buddies growing up, he always had a new car when we were growing up. He always had the coolest new toy, the new cell phone, the new whatever. I wasn't super wealthy growing up for a period of my childhood. I was on food stamps, I believe it or not. Before my mom got her nursing job. So I just went and asked him, what do you do? And turns out he was in real estate. He did some investments that were out of the country. He was proven so he had some investments in Peru. But he opened up a brokerage in America, right? And real estate and the lending brokerage, helping people find property and finance it. And he was also an insurance broker. And funny, you can kind of see why I decided to be what I did. And he realized that, hey, there's a need for the financial service industry. And he targeted, you know, mainly a Hispanic database, right? So people who couldn't necessarily go into a bank and get the normal loans. They didn't communicate with the banker very well. They didn't understand not only a language barrier, but just kind of the culture. They trusted him, though. He was kind of like the hefe, right? And so I got to see a very unique perspective. I fell in love with it. I fell in love with being able to understand real estate and understand finances in a way that I never took a finance class in college. You know, I didn't know what an interest rate was. You know, I didn't know really anything. So kind of had a whole, you know, brave new world open up to me. And just like I said, fell in love with it. Fell in love with being able to help people find, you know, the new investment or even their first primary residence, you know, helping them get out of renting and start building up some equity and realize home ownership. You know, then obviously packaging all the other services of assisting with financing and even protecting it via insurance, right? And going to one place kind of my dream was what this is kind of coalesced into now. Going to one place that you can get the advice of everywhere, right? You don't have to go to a farmers or a state farm and then go to a RE/MAX and then go to a chase to get a mortgage and then go over here to get a property management company and then go over here to get tax advice. The long term goal of the one brokerage is to be the one brokerage for everything you need, right? And while we're still working on aspects of it, the property management, the tax prep, all that, our lending really, really, really took off because I think arguably that's one of the biggest needs in the industry, right? Everything's important, but you can't buy anything without financing, right? And it's a lot of times it is much more complicated than what you see online, right? And there's a lot of people that say a lot of stuff like they know what they're doing and it's you know, being in it now for as long as I have being fortunate enough to work with the types of people. Like you said, I've definitely found myself in the position of advising the advisors, right? The gurus and the course providers are usually calling me and to host my portion of their course. And that's not a dig to them at all. That's that's absolute, you know, appreciation that I have for them and being able to put me in those positions. Yeah, no, you're you have a legendary reputation and somebody who is often sought after to get their opinion and their perspective on not just how to be a better loan officer or real estate agent, but also just what's going on in the industry. And right now, you know, I think we're dealing, we were talking about this just before we went on alive, which was, you know, we have this inventory issue. We just don't have much, there's not much out there. Part of that I think is due to the refinance that happened, you know, the big refinance boom that obviously all of us remember from several years, many years ago. And, you know, we are all locked into these lower interest rates that we, you know, don't want to leave. And also we get to work from home now for a lot of us. So there's that piece of it too. So we have, you know, all of this going on yet in the last year was the 30, the lowest home sales 30 years, believe it or not. So we had, we have just have a lot, lot happening. Tell me what you think's going on right now and what you would do. Yeah, we were, we were chatting a little bit about this before, and it's, it's going to be able to put this out there now. And just on the, on the kind of number side of what you're saying, we're, you know, we were all time lows, you know, inventory and sales, just in my industry alone, in loan officers, I believe going back to 2021, if you compare the license loan officers from then till now, about 80% of them have left the industry. So, yeah, I saw that or out of five loan officers that were here during COVID are gone, which is crazy to think about. I mean, a name another industry that in four years has an 80% withdrawal from that's wild, right? But taking that aside, what I think I have kind of a unique take on this. And I, I got a little bit of pushback on bigger pockets for saying this because it could be coded as maybe fear mongering, not how I intend this, but I'll do a little mental exercise with all listeners. Go back to your childhood. Who did you know that owned multiple homes? I didn't know anybody, right? My grandma owned it. My grandma owned a house. My mom didn't yet when I was a kid, but you know, I had like an uncle who owned a house, right? Like, you know, people who had long term jobs, but like nobody was investing in Florida or investing in the smokies or I live in California. So that's like across, you know, the country, even like going up and buying maybe I had a friend who owned like a vacation cabin in Tahoe or mammoth or big bear, you know, something that you go to once or twice a year. People weren't buying like rentals though, right? And of course, there were. It was just much, much fewer and farther between, right? And everybody that I asked this, most people say, no, yeah, I can't really remember anybody that had like a portfolio when I was a kid, right? Sure. And I think with the surge of accessibility of advice, bigger pockets, your show podcast, just the ease that getting advice can come with now. You know, a lot of people go take a course, right? From some guru, some provider, whatever, right? I'd learn how to invest in real estate and they can learn cap rates and NOIs and interest rates and how to invest and what the out payments you need and what loan product you need. You're probably hearing somebody like me in that course, discussing different loan products, right? That just wasn't around before, right? If you wanted a loan, you would go to Washington Mutual, right? Which is, yeah, those who remember, that was pre-chase, right? Or you'd go, you'd go to your bank of America, you go to Wells Fargo and like, that's how you got a mortgage before, right? And most times they didn't like giving you mortgages that were for a house across the country, right? So I think what we're witnessing is a combination of multiple factors. Obviously, the interest rates have a have a say, of course. That led to the golden handcuffs where people just don't want to get out, you know, people who qualified at 3% just don't qualify for a comparable home at 7%. So they stay put, right? So there's an objective barrier of leaving there that a lot of homeowners are in. On top of that, we have a lack of building and that's, I think, arguably the most important thing. If any of you guys have built, I've dabbled with it. I've helped a lot of clients with fixed and flipped loans or ran up construction loans, whatever it is. It is a nightmare to get through the legal loop holes and the city and council and zoning and ordinance and everything you have to go through to build anything, right? That's hard. Obviously, on top of that, the cost, right? You know, lumbering with all these tariffs and everything going on now, you know, we get most of our lumber from Canada. It's not getting cheaper. It's not getting cheaper. Right? So when you put all these things together, yes, obviously you have a recipe for something that was easy to get prior becoming harder. But when you also combine that with, you're no longer competing with people in your neighborhood. You're competing with the Californian, buying a rental property. You're competing with BlackRock. You're completing with these institutional buyers that 20 years ago, 30 years ago, 40 years ago, didn't exist. They weren't doing this, right? Even myself, I own 20, something single-family homes now. Like I'm a competitor for people in Florida in Tennessee and North Carolina and Arizona. I don't live there, right? 30 years ago, I would have not been anywhere near them. And now I wouldn't have had access. 100%. Right? I wouldn't have known how to get a property management. I wouldn't have known how to run an Airbnb. I'm a short-term rental investor for those curious. You know, I wouldn't have known how to finance that. Like, yeah, it wouldn't have been an option. And now, I think what we're witnessing is a significant consolidation of real estate, not necessarily a crash, not necessarily anything like that. I think, and I'll say my very, you know, kind of edgy thing here that I said on bigger pockets, I'm under the assumption that if you don't buy real estate in the next five to 10 years, I'm not sure you will be able to after that as somebody who doesn't own real estate. And that's not fear-mongering. That's not me pressure-staling you. That's not me saying, you know, please go do this so I can make a commission. None of that. Even if I wasn't in the industry, I see signs that if they're not turned around, so if there's not laws that go into place that limit these big institutional buyers or, you know, different tax brackets for these types of things, I think they're just going to keep doing it. And I think people like me are going to keep doing it because it is the best investment that I see available to make. I love real estate. I believe in it. I believe it builds generational wealth and I want my kids to have it. And I think the people doing it are going to continue doing it. And eventually it will reach a breaking point where we're not building as fast as the investors can buy. And that leaves nothing left for your first time home buyer. And that's kind of a frightful time. And you guys hear, you know, things like Blackwark saying, you'll, you know, you'll own nothing and be happy. I wouldn't be like, that's not me. You know, like I'm going to, I'm going to get a piece of the pie, right? And I recommend if you guys are sitting on the fence, rates are hard, qualifying is hard. 100%. Talk to a lender, find a way to do it. Most people can, whether it's getting a co-signer, whether it's qualifying as a household, whether it's selling something else you have, because if you want to buy real estate, the longer you wait, the harder it's going to get. And I firmly, right now there's a little bit of an opportunity, although I hate to even use the word opportunity because it's, it's, it technically is, but it's not a super attractive opportunity. But because there's not much inventory, there's not much competition. So in that sense, you might be getting things that a bit of a discount right now. So I think that's what REALTORS ought to be having conversations with two, they're, they're clients really talking about what do you want to do in the next couple of years? Do you want to move? Now might be the time, yes, you're going to give up, if you're a current homeowner, you're going to give up that 3% rate, but you're maybe going to get, and you're going to double that rate potentially, or more, more than double it. But, you know, eventually you'll be able to refi that down, but you can, maybe even, you'll have a lot less competition. Yeah, that's making, I mean, if anybody was buying during COVID, I was in that category. You guys remember you weren't buying anything and asking, you weren't buying anything, you know, with good terms for you. Yes, the interest rates were nice, but you were overpaying for things, right? And now, you know, like you mentioned, there is, there is an opportunity to get stuff, you know, at market value, probably even below market value, you get some seller credit, save on closing costs, buy your rate down, you know, there's, there's much more opportunity for that now. It's still not easy. I don't want to, I'm not trying to create a facade here. It's a difficult time to invest in real estate. I think it's a difficult time, just economically for our country right now, right? Kind of no matter what sector you're in. And I think real estate provides a unique opportunity that a lot of other things don't, you know, and it's, it's, when you look at, you know, comparing real estate to the stock market, comparing real estate to a 401k or in almost every scenario, it's hard to make an argument against right? Especially when you take advantage of low down payment options and, you know, refinancing when the rates get good, you know, I learned this the other day, you know, in most countries, you can't refinance a lot of people don't know this. So the word mortgage, it means I believe it means a death packed. That's what it means death or a death pledge. I think it means death pledge. Because the word mortgage was intended to stay there till you die. Now in America, we have a 30 or more years, which obviously is until you die. But I was talking to somebody who I think was Spanish or Italian and he said, what is refinance? Like, what does that mean? And I'm like, oh, that's whenever it's beneficial for you, you can tell the lender are deals off. I want a new one. And he's like, can the lender do that to you? I'd love the rates to go up. I'm like, I've never been asked that what? No, the lender can't do that to you. He's like, that's not fair. I'm like, I've never heard somebody, you know, think about it this way. I'm like, yeah, I guess that's not fair for the bank, but it's fair for us. He's like, oh my God, I want to invest in America. When we get alone where I'm from, like, you can't refinance. There's no such thing. And I thought that was so interesting. I'm like, wow, we take the little things like that. We take for granted. Right? It's like everybody went and got a 3% rate during COVID. That's because of the way the American financial system set up. You know, you could go spur your last lender that had you at a 6% and you could go, you know, pair up with one that's at 3 and put yourself in a much better financial position. Yeah, I think you're absolutely right. I think there's two, there's the there is an opportunity for agents who really because we know that home value prices have gone up, right? So over the last five years, if you sold somebody at home, odds are the value has appreciated to some degree. So they're going to be happy with you. They're going to like you. They're going to be grateful that they made that investment. And you just got to get them over that sort of lending or the lending rate hurdle. But understand that, you know, you'd date the rate you marry the house, right? That's always been the for primary residents, for sure. Yeah, 100% and I mean, I we kind of we preach a pretty cool investing strategy that I think a lot of agents would be would be really really benefited by knowing this. We preach the one house of your strategy, which is what it sounds like, obviously, it's one house you buy one house a year, right? But the idea is it's a replacement to your typical 401k or your typical IRA, right? So the people that are doing, you know, your three to eight percent 401k and IRA contributions every year, take that aside and you can put that as a three to five percent down payment on a new home and you move primary residences every year. Now the thought process is, oh, well, now I don't have a retirement. Well, if you had your 401k, you tap into it when you're what 65, whatever it is, right? You start paying some taxes at that point, which you think taxes are going to be higher or lower when you're 65, probably higher, right? But regardless, even if you're in some tax benefit, the benefit of the account, if you're buying a house every year and you do that for the next 15 to 20 years and you put them on, you know, let's say 30 year notes and you start this at 35, that means you end when you're 65. Your first year of retirement when you're 65, you have the very first house you bought paid off and full now because you've extended 30 years, you paid off well, you can go do a cash out refinance and that's tax-free and that's a rental property now paying for itself and I, what do you think of $500,000 houses worth 30 years from now? $3 million maybe? Something crazy. Yeah. So you go cash out $2.5 million retirement and boom, you have your first year of income in retirement, $2.5 million tax-free. Amazing. And what happens in your 31? Well, now my second house I bought is paid off. You want $2.5 million again or you want to hold off with your first $2.5 million? Okay, well let's subsidize your retirement now by financing the real estate that you bought over the course of 30 years, never putting down more than 5% because you just did a primary residence every year. Now that's uncomfortable. You have to move a lot but when you look at that return of millions of dollars a year of tax-free in your retirement, I know a lot of people who take that deal. You know, I would take that deal. 100%. So getting into real estate investing can be a lot easier and people think people think they need a huge amount of money. You don't in a lot of cases. You need to be able to qualify for these loans and that's the hard part right now. So talking to a lender, you know, if an agent's listed this, have your borrower, talk to a lender, have you talked to a lender, talk through solutions that they can come. Oh, we need to seize your earnings a little longer. We need to, you know, get a higher paying job. We need to add your sister or your girlfriend on to here that can qualify with you. Maybe your parents can co-sign. There's always a creative solution, right? Just starting the conversation is what most people never get to the point of though. So let's, yeah, let's break that process down again because I'm very fascinated by this. So essentially what we're doing is we're moving every year, we're finding a new property that we like and walk us through kind of how that works. Yeah. So let's say, I mean, let's just say we have a household income of $100,000 a year, right? Two people making 50K, pretty average, right? So let's say that those people would be, I think most people would put about 15% into retirement. They try, right? So 15 grand is going into retirement. I'm saying instead of that, yeah, if you took 15 grand that first year, you've worked one year. Good job. You've saved incredible. Take 15 grand and put 3% down on a new primary residence. That's $500,000 property. That will buy you a starter home in most markets in America. If you're in San Francisco, it's not, but you're also probably 100 grand, you're probably not making San Francisco. So it skills with the area, right? You go put 3% down for your first home, you buy a property, you try to flint that mortgage, you try to get comfortable with the payments. It's probably more than you're going to pay in rent right now, but that's what we got. Okay? The second year, that $500,000 property, maybe it's worth 510 or 520 now, right? There's something in some amount of appreciation. Great. Leave it alone. You now move with your next $15,000 that you made, maybe you got a little bit of a raise at work set that money aside. Let's say we have 20,000. In year two, we're buying a new house, leaving our old one and converting it to a rental property. You can think of this intelligently, maybe you target a multi-family, maybe you target a condo, something that can rent for close to what the mortgage is, right? Even if it's a small loss, that's okay. So in year two, now you have one property that's basically cash flow neutral, and you have your new property that you just moved into. And you put a grand total of 15 and let's call it 20, $35,000 down and you bought a million dollars of real estate. That's pretty cool, right? Yeah. I didn't think $50,000 could buy me a million dollars in real estate. That sounds incredible. Cool. And now you copy and paste. And if you do that every year, your rents are going up. If ever a COVID comes again, you take your entire portfolio and refinance it down. All the 7% rates now turn into fours or fives, right? And you keep that portfolio and you just keep paying that mortgage, keep paying it, keep paying it, keep paying it, keep paying. Remember, I took away your retirement, so you don't have that, right? So at some point, you're going to want to cash out of your investments. If you were in stocks, that means you're selling the stock, if it was retirement, that means you're withdrawing and you're paying whatever fees or taxes or deferred that you have at that point. In real estate, that means you're leveraging or selling. 30 years down the line, we follow the same trajectory. The first property we bought, now is 100% paid off. We leverage it. Or you sell it. You can sell a property every year in your retirement if you want. Then you get the full equity, right? And you guys can imagine if you track back here, what 30 years ago would have been, what, 95? What could you buy houses for in your area, 90, 95? 300,000? Yeah, I'd say even less than that. I mean, I know, I know some people were buying, I mean, my grandma bought her house for $40,000. It's worth like 3 million now. Granted, she was on like a dirt road that's now all been developed. So that's a unique one. But sure, a couple hundred thousand dollars, right? Those properties aren't worth that now. And you put 5% down of 100, $200, 300,000. And now you're sitting on $2 million in equity in your retirement and you did that for 30 years. There's not a way that fails. Even if one of those properties, like you have to fix somebody and you're way cash flow negative, once you start building it up, they're supporting each other, right? Like you're going to be okay, right? And eventually you can start cutting into the money that you're paying on rent anyway. So like your primary residence is always going to be an expense. You can build it up to the point where your rentals cover your primary, you start living for free. That's where you get into multi-family and house hacking, depending on how uncomfortable you want to be. But the mindset is still replace. What I think is one of the biggest cons in America is the 401k with something that actually puts you ahead. Right? Yeah, it's super interesting. Makes a ton of sense. And my mind is spinning because I need to start building up my portfolio as well. Because you're absolutely right, you know, markets go up and down. Obviously stock market does raise over time. If we think the average 401k is probably going to average, I don't know, seven to nine percent a year over time per year. It's not bad. Pretty decent, you know, double your money every 10 years or so. That's good investment. But you're also at the, you're also really at the mercy of whatever is happening at that time when you need that money. And the idea of building a home portfolio or investment portfolio of real estate is particularly interesting because we see the trends of home buying trends have gone down. Right? We've seen less younger people in particular, they're buying homes later. I think the average home first time home buyer last year was 38 years old. And that was up from like 35 the year before. So people are buying homes later. They're renting a lot longer. So this, this is a huge opportunity. I just think people also, because of the, I think it's the work from home thing that's been so much of the catalyst for this, because people can be a little bit more nomadic. They can go. They can, they can go from here to there and are all connected with technology. So there's this ability to like all of here for a little while, that all of there for a little while. And I'll just kind of sprint across the country, renting and, and you know, there's a lot of advantages to renting too, which is you get better stuff usually. I'm a weird example of this. I don't, I don't own where I currently, you guys probably tell my background here. I'm in an apartment. I have a portfolio of 20 plus properties and I don't own where I live personally because I'm exactly like you said, I travel a lot. I like to get around. I don't like having a big mortgage when I'm not there. You know, I get to buy new stuff every year. A lot of times my places come furnished. Right? I didn't buy this furniture behind me. Or I came with the apartment. It's obvious. I don't, I live very lightly. Right? Now that's not the right move for everybody. Right? Those people who are building a family and, you know, building a relationship. They want a place that they can call home base. But if you can fit into that category where, you know, you can supremely, I mean, I'm paying a tenth here, what I would pay for a house in my area. Right? And I still get to live all my family and friends. I still get all the cool amenities of living in sunny SoCal. And I'm paying less than what? Less than about 24 hundred bucks a month in this place that if I was owning a property, same thing with three bedrooms and in a backyard, I'm paying eight, nine grand a month in a mortgage. Right? Crazy. And that money instead is going to my investments. I'm doing it. I'm practicing what I preach. I'm doing the same thing where I'm buying rentals every year. Right? And my goal is in 30, 35, 40 years whenever I finally decided to call it quits. There's going to be a very good opportunity there to leverage subsidize my retirement and ultimately have have a really cool, really cool thing to pass down to whoever comes after me. Right? Yeah, I think agents who are not sort of thinking about the strategy as a education piece to bring to your clients, you're really missing an opportunity here because you can just crunch the numbers. I mean, heck, just go to chat GPT and ask them to explain this to you. Chat GPT, I'll explain it to you very effectively as well. And you can even practice your pitch with chat GPT as well. But the idea is that, you know, people are always looking for investment opportunities. The markets, obviously great financial advisors will can handle all of that stuff. But you now have this opportunity to bring a second sort of stream of income. And, you know, also too, you know, 401k is do not provide a steady stream of income along the way. There's tax benefits, of course, on the way out. Sure. But are along the way and on the way out. But but I like the idea of having my money work for me today. And so, you know, there's there's this thing that, you know, it's really funny. Like we have to live somewhere. We all have to live somewhere. So you're either going to be renting or buying everyone's always going to be renting or buying. And there's a trend towards more renting. Now, what does that mean for the real estate agent industry? I don't know. I hope it continues to be flourish and I guess we'll see. But you want to obviously bring these opportunities to your clients because they're going to learn about it anyway. Yeah. And it would be the person that does it. And, you know, tell us, tell us about your brokerage. Why did you build your own brokerage? Yeah, yeah, good question. Really. So I actually started out as a real estate agent. Did that for quite a while and then I realized I was sending referrals to, you know, a lender that wasn't doing a good job. So I said, okay, let me see how hard that is. Right? Let's see what that's about. Start a mortgage brokerage. After that realized, hey, there's insurance on the other side of that and in the same format that my, my quote unquote mentor had set up for me when I started. I said, hey, I can do all this. This makes sense. Now I'm solely focused on the lending aspect. But I started it because I once again, there was just, there was a need, right? When I would talk to people, showing them houses, you know, doing that ever, they wouldn't know how to discuss, how do I budget this? What is my monthly payment going to be? What's my interest rate? What if I, can I refinance in the future? What if I want to add an ADU? What would the rental income be for that? You know, and there were just so many questions that I saw such an opportunity there to answer that I honestly became the brokerage, you know, the, the roles that I have today because I was curious. Like I was going and seeking out those answers. And as I found them, I wanted to turn around and give them to customers, right? So really, I became a mortgage broker because I was getting mortgages. Right? I was starting to get interested in my property and I, I was fascinated by the industry and I thought there was a, there was a supreme lack in what was available, whether it was online or in the community or just what I saw, you know, with my family, right? My family didn't know. They thought, oh, you go to Chase to get a loan. Well, Chase only does, you know, primary, this and very clean cut investment loans. And I would hear, you know, I was, I would listen to bigger pockets before I was on it. And he's just saying, like, how are these guys aren't getting loans at Chase? Chase wouldn't give David Green a loan. He's got 85 single-family homes in Jacksonville. He's way past the conventional loan limit, right? And that's where I started to realize there's a whole wonderful world, right? Behind the scenes of lending that, once I started realizing was there, I couldn't help but share it, right? Yeah, it's, it's so great. And, you know, we're so excited to have you on the show. And we really want to bring this to our audience to think about not just for yourself, but obviously for your clients. Like, this is a real opportunity for to build up, build equity, build retirement. And I'm excited about it because I need to do this as well. I do not always have confidence as much confidence in the stock market as I, well, number one, I'm not picking individual stocks. I stopped doing that a million years ago. But I just, you know, I have no control over that. I have literally no control over what happens to my investments. And I am diversified in the stock market, like all of us probably are. And that's good. And we should also have other streams of income too. So this is a great opportunity to bring to your home buyers, even if they're just primary resident people and they don't want to move. But okay, hey, maybe consider saving a little bit more, investing in property and just kind of running the numbers. And somebody like Christian can actually help you on the lending side of it. You can also explain how it works. And I jump in on intro calls with REALTORS and their clients all the time. Like, all the time, I don't just have to talk to your agent. I don't just have to talk to you. Let's all get together. We'll plan out a method of plan of attack together, right? Like, is this possible in the market you're searching it? Right? The agent can answer that better than I can. Like, I'm not a master in, we're a nationwide lender. I'm not a master in every zip code in America. But I can tell you what the bar work and qualify for and then you can kind of guide them to where that will work. Yeah, I love that. And the one brokerage.com is where you go to learn all about Christian and everything that they offer for real estate investments, also primary residents as well. They're licensed and all over, they can do loans all over the country. So definitely reach out to them. They are amazing. They're fantastic. And you also follow Christian on Instagram.

Check out his lending. Talk to him. Have him educate you so that you can educate your clients and keep your business rolling. Because again, if Christian is right and the real estate market continues to get gobbled up by institutional investors over the years, which we see no sign of that slowing down, we are going to have a shortage, right? We're going to have problems. We don't have issues. And so you want to start investing as quickly as possible. And certainly making the at least the pitch or the educational pitch to your clients and yourself have this conversation. It's really fun. It's exciting. And you don't also have to get those 2 a.m. phone calls as a property manager. There are solutions to that as well. So you don't don't have to worry about every part of that because obviously there's lots of services that can support that. But yeah, Christian, we're going to continue to obviously have you on every month. We're going to talk about this. We're going to educate our audience. And guys, bring us your questions.
