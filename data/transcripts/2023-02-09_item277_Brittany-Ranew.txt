[00:04:34] Brittany, welcome to the show.
[00:04:36] Hi, DJ, thanks for having me.
[00:04:38] I appreciate it.
[00:04:39] I get very nervous when I talk to other podcast hosts.
[00:04:42] And when people hear this final version,
[00:04:44] they won't know that I screwed up three times
[00:04:46] in my introduction to you.
[00:04:48] So I am a little frazzled right now.
[00:04:50] So I have to get back to my center
[00:04:53] or else I am gonna be, it's funny, I get very nervous.
[00:04:56] Like I can't screw up in front of another broadcast.
[00:04:59] Oh God.
[00:05:00] But I did.
[00:05:03] Well, I think this is great.
[00:05:05] It's actually a great segue into what we're eventually
[00:05:08] gonna talk about, which are one of the topics
[00:05:11] with being mindset.
[00:05:12] So we'll get to a place where maybe I can take a lesson
[00:05:15] from you and learn how to quiet the voices in my head
[00:05:19] that are telling me I'm screwing this up.
[00:05:21] But before we get to me, let's talk about you.
[00:05:26] And I would love to hear one, actually I don't know this story
[00:05:30] as how you got into real estate.
[00:05:31] So if you don't mind sharing that.
[00:05:33] Yeah.
[00:05:34] So kind of an interesting path.
[00:05:37] I have a music background.
[00:05:38] So I actually went to school for music.
[00:05:40] I was a vocal major.
[00:05:42] Wow.
[00:05:43] Did you do that in Florida or somewhere else?
[00:05:45] So I'm from Mobile, Alabama, originally in Hornet Ray.
[00:05:48] So it was a local school there.
[00:05:50] And so we moved to St. Pete 2015.
[00:05:54] So I just like my husband and I born to raise a mobile
[00:05:57] and took a leap and moved to St. Pete.
[00:05:59] So yeah.
[00:06:01] So did you have dreams of being like a singer?
[00:06:05] Did you want to sing professionally or?
[00:06:07] I did.
[00:06:08] And I had a writing background as well.
[00:06:11] So definitely in that creative space.
[00:06:14] Sure.
[00:06:15] And so I was like, well, you know what?
[00:06:18] I'm not going to be a professional singer.
[00:06:20] At least at this moment in time.
[00:06:21] So why don't I pursue the music industry on the business side?
[00:06:26] So there is a local company, media company
[00:06:28] that I started working for a mobile.
[00:06:32] I mentioned having a creative side.
[00:06:34] So that was something I wanted to have my own business.
[00:06:37] So I started a vent planning company.
[00:06:39] So I was doing that on the side while it worked full time
[00:06:42] at this media company.
[00:06:44] And that was like, so we grow and kind of get in my feet
[00:06:48] with.
[00:06:48] And then I got laid off for my job after they sold
[00:06:52] to another company and closed down operations in mobile.
[00:06:56] So I was like, oh, what am I supposed to do with myself now?
[00:07:01] I mean, I'm young at my first real full time job
[00:07:04] at a college.
[00:07:05] So it was kind of traumatic to get laid off.
[00:07:08] So I had the vent planning company.
[00:07:10] And I was like, you know what?
[00:07:12] I've always loved houses.
[00:07:14] Real estate sounds like something else
[00:07:16] that I could really make my own.
[00:07:17] So I got my real estate license.
[00:07:20] It was I was doing both trying to build real estate,
[00:07:23] had the vent planning company.
[00:07:25] Then that wasn't really going the way I wanted it to.
[00:07:28] And I was starting to fall in love with real estate.
[00:07:30] I was like, you know what?
[00:07:31] I'm going to just go all in in real estate.
[00:07:34] And that was in about I got licensed in 2013,
[00:07:38] end of 13 and 2014 is where I really kind of like went full time.
[00:07:43] 
[00:07:44] Yeah, it's that's a quite a shift.
[00:07:46] But I guess with the event planning background
[00:07:48] and the media company background, it probably,
[00:07:51] especially you doing your own event planning,
[00:07:53] I imagine that probably was that the sort of first entrepreneurial thing
[00:07:57] that you did where you're like, okay,
[00:07:58] I want to be in charge of my own life
[00:08:00] in my own time and all of that.
[00:08:01] Yeah.
[00:08:02] And my husband was in kind of a not so great work environment.
[00:08:09] And I was like, you know what?
[00:08:11] If I have my own business that it's limitless,
[00:08:15] I can do whatever I want.
[00:08:17] You know, the income is limitless.
[00:08:19] And so I just had these dreams of like, all right,
[00:08:21] I'm going to help us build this different life,
[00:08:24] you know, life that we always imagined.
[00:08:28] And things didn't go exactly as planned.
[00:08:31] It was a lot slower growth than I wanted it to be,
[00:08:35] which came back to my mindset,
[00:08:37] but I didn't know that at the time.
[00:08:39] So when we moved to St.P,
[00:08:42] it was a job opportunity for my husband,
[00:08:43] Stephen, that was just life, it was a life changing move.
[00:08:48] And it just really helped me kind of get out of my shell
[00:08:51] and it helped put us on a path for really a better future.
[00:08:55] But so when you move to St.P,
[00:08:58] and by the way, if anyone out there has not visited
[00:09:01] St.P, it is just a lovely,
[00:09:04] even if it's just a day trip,
[00:09:06] because a lot of times,
[00:09:07] because I visit my sister in Tampa,
[00:09:09] which I'm there a lot,
[00:09:10] and I was telling Brittany earlier that,
[00:09:13] I mean, we didn't really talk about St.P,
[00:09:15] but because my mom, my parents,
[00:09:16] they're in clear water, which is also kind of a comparable
[00:09:19] type of area, although very different,
[00:09:21] but cool as well in a different way.
[00:09:24] And St.P, I always, I love the Dolly Museum.
[00:09:27] I love, I mean, just everything about St.P is just,
[00:09:30] it just feels kind of fancy and trendy and fun and cool
[00:09:33] and easy to fall in love with.
[00:09:36] So it is easy to fall in love with.
[00:09:39] And every time I leave it,
[00:09:41] even though it's only like a 30 minute drive
[00:09:42] back to my sister's 40 minutes,
[00:09:44] I'm like, oh, I love this place.
[00:09:47] There's more going on, I think,
[00:09:48] in St.P. than Clearwater,
[00:09:50] and that's not a dig at Clearwater at all.
[00:09:52] I love Clearwater.
[00:09:53] It's just a different,
[00:09:54] Clearwater is more of a beachy vibe,
[00:09:55] and St.P. it's a little bit more like
[00:09:57] of an upscale kind of fun,
[00:09:59] but it's also a very difficult place to become a rilter,
[00:10:02] because it's such an exclusive area,
[00:10:05] obviously prices are high, competition is high.
[00:10:08] There's just lots going on there.
[00:10:10] So I am really curious how you got started
[00:10:14] in St.P. because that's not an easy place to get started.
[00:10:20] No, and I was, like I said,
[00:10:23] I had some mindset issues that I was dealing with,
[00:10:26] so that was a struggle as well.
[00:10:28] So I decided to not start selling right away when we moved.
[00:10:34] And it was a hard decision,
[00:10:36] because I loved real estate,
[00:10:38] but it was ultimately the right one,
[00:10:40] because I needed to kind of get myself settled.
[00:10:45] So I actually was the office administrator
[00:10:48] for my office that I'm at
[00:10:50] at Premiere Set the Bees International Realty.
[00:10:52] So it was cool because I got to immerse myself
[00:10:57] in the market, learn,
[00:11:00] and I had like a steady paycheck,
[00:11:03] and then I could learn the company,
[00:11:06] and how amazing, when an amazing company is,
[00:11:08] and all the resources that we have,
[00:11:10] and it gave me time to build that sense of community.
[00:11:15] So that was in 2017,
[00:11:18] is when I got back into sales full time,
[00:11:21] and I did the ground running at that point.
[00:11:24] Yeah, because you, you know, that is,
[00:11:27] that's the first time in all of the people I've interviewed
[00:11:30] that I believe someone has gone that particular path.
[00:11:34] And as I'm hearing it now,
[00:11:35] it makes perfect sense,
[00:11:37] and I'm sort of shocked that I don't hear more people
[00:11:39] having done that.
[00:11:41] You know, basically the way I think about it is,
[00:11:42] it was almost, I mean, yes, you were paid,
[00:11:44] and you were paid to do that role.
[00:11:47] But I imagine it was just a learning experience.
[00:11:49] You had to absorb so much,
[00:11:51] probably great best practices,
[00:11:54] and maybe things not worth doing,
[00:11:56] and really just watching other,
[00:11:57] you're basically, or just in,
[00:11:59] if you were at an office where people came in,
[00:12:01] and the agents worked there,
[00:12:02] then boy, I can't even imagine what an education that was.
[00:12:06] Yeah, it was tremendous,
[00:12:08] and also just kudos to my company
[00:12:12] for letting me make that transition.
[00:12:15] You know, I went from office minister back into sales.
[00:12:18] So, you know, sometimes that can be a little sticky,
[00:12:21] because we are in a competitive environment,
[00:12:24] especially in Florida, you know.
[00:12:27] Yeah.
[00:12:28] But yeah, it was, it was the way I needed to do it,
[00:12:31] and I'm not gonna lie, say it was easy,
[00:12:33] because it was tough.
[00:12:35] I hurt my pride a little bit to not be selling,
[00:12:39] but it was definitely the right way for me.
[00:12:43] When you finally got into production,
[00:12:46] and that, so you had been in St. Pete
[00:12:47] for several years at that point, correct?
[00:12:50] Yes, to that, yeah.
[00:12:51] So 2015, so it was two,
[00:12:55] it was about a year and a half, basically,
[00:12:58] from when we moved to when I got back into sales.
[00:13:00] So, yeah.
[00:13:01] And so at that point still,
[00:13:03] and again, I don't know your sort of social life
[00:13:05] and how active you are getting out and meeting people,
[00:13:08] but essentially I'm assuming you didn't have a sphere
[00:13:10] of influence when you moved there,
[00:13:12] or at least how many small ones.
[00:13:14] Right, not in the zero.
[00:13:16] And then having to build that in,
[00:13:20] and it's interesting, because I am met,
[00:13:23] and I don't know that much about St. Pete,
[00:13:24] like the residents of St. Pete,
[00:13:26] I don't know how many are born and raised,
[00:13:27] live their whole lives there,
[00:13:29] but I bet it's a lot of people who move there
[00:13:31] at some point in their life,
[00:13:33] and it isn't a lot of born and raised,
[00:13:35] and sort of, I'm there my whole entire existence.
[00:13:38] So it's gotta be tough to really sort of establish oneself,
[00:13:41] because there's so much,
[00:13:43] so many people coming in and leaving,
[00:13:45] that you have all these other agents
[00:13:47] that are also trying to make those relationships
[00:13:50] with these new residents,
[00:13:52] or people who are newer to the area
[00:13:53] are thinking of moving there.
[00:13:55] How did you go about finding clients
[00:13:58] when you got into production?
[00:14:00] Yeah, I'm a very social person,
[00:14:03] so my husband, I joked that just about all the friends
[00:14:06] that we have here is because I made them first,
[00:14:09] so I was not afraid to get out there and meet people,
[00:14:14] and I think that's something that people forget,
[00:14:19] is it's kind of hard to make friends as an adult.
[00:14:21] Totally hard, yes.
[00:14:23] You have to put yourself out there and be vulnerable
[00:14:26] to be able to connect with new people.
[00:14:29] It's almost like dating, it's kind of a weird...
[00:14:32] It is very much that way, yes.
[00:14:34] So it's like I had to take the initiative
[00:14:36] to constantly meet people,
[00:14:39] and then when I met people like,
[00:14:40] hey, which like to hang out,
[00:14:42] it takes that, until you get into rhythm with people,
[00:14:45] where they start contacting you.
[00:14:47] So it was me just being really persistent,
[00:14:52] because I wanted to build community,
[00:14:53] because that's how I thrive.
[00:14:56] So again, it was just me being consistent
[00:14:58] and pursuing relationships,
[00:15:00] and over time it just got easier and easier,
[00:15:04] and we've lived here for eight years now,
[00:15:09] and we just love it, and we have the best friends, so.
[00:15:14] I was meeting with a newly licensed agent
[00:15:17] last night, or 4.30 yesterday,
[00:15:20] and she was asking me,
[00:15:23] she was interviewing our firm,
[00:15:25] and she's like, if you were me,
[00:15:26] and she was new to Chicago,
[00:15:28] she's like, I mean, she's been here for a year,
[00:15:29] but she's like, I don't really know hardly anyone.
[00:15:31] And I said, she goes,
[00:15:33] what would, if you were me, what would you do?
[00:15:35] And I said, you know, it's not easy.
[00:15:38] That's a tough position for anybody to be in,
[00:15:40] and I said, really if it was me,
[00:15:42] I would figure out every day how to meet like two or three
[00:15:45] new people and add them to my database.
[00:15:47] And that's actually a pretty difficult thing to do.
[00:15:49] It sounds like pretty simple,
[00:15:50] but I said, if I go your biggest problem is,
[00:15:54] you know, you don't have a large sphere,
[00:15:55] but you can remedy that.
[00:15:57] It just is gonna take a year or two,
[00:15:59] and you're going to have to meet people.
[00:16:00] That'll be like part of your day every day is,
[00:16:02] yes, you have to learn the real estate business
[00:16:04] and develop those skills and all of the normal
[00:16:07] being a good REALTOR stuff,
[00:16:08] but you really need to get out there
[00:16:10] and meet as many people as you can,
[00:16:11] get their information,
[00:16:12] and then figure out a way that you can stay in contact
[00:16:14] with them and provide value to them,
[00:16:16] and so that whenever they eventually are ready,
[00:16:19] but it was this adding people to your database.
[00:16:21] I'm like, it's kind of like,
[00:16:22] I call it the pushups of real estate when you're new.
[00:16:24] Like nobody really wants to do pushups,
[00:16:26] but it's a good idea if you want to build strength,
[00:16:28] and you can do it anywhere.
[00:16:30] That's kind of how I think about like building your business
[00:16:32] when you first start.
[00:16:33] Just meet as many people as you can, get their information,
[00:16:36] and then start to figure out how to stay in communication
[00:16:38] and community with them.
[00:16:40] And that actually leads me to this other thing I want to mention
[00:16:42] or talk about, which I think really fits into community
[00:16:46] is the podcast that you do.
[00:16:49] Tell us why you started doing it
[00:16:51] and how it's sort of gone for you.
[00:16:55] Yeah, so I, well, I will say kind of the initial thought
[00:16:59] came from Palm Ferry, which I know a lot of us agents
[00:17:04] listen to Palm Ferry, so he's always been so big on
[00:17:08] being video first and being like what he would call
[00:17:11] a digital mayor of your community.
[00:17:13] And I got inspired by that.
[00:17:15] It's like, oh, that'd be so fun.
[00:17:17] Like I love small business.
[00:17:18] I love shopping local.
[00:17:19] Maybe I can be the digital mayor of St.P.
[00:17:22] And then I was like, oh gosh, I don't know how,
[00:17:25] like I wasn't doing video consistently at that time.
[00:17:28] So I was like, I don't know how to do this.
[00:17:30] And this was probably in about 2019, I would say.
[00:17:33] I was really mulling this over.
[00:17:35] I was like, I don't know how to have videos
[00:17:37] and like go into a shop and I was thinking like news anchor,
[00:17:42] you know, it was just kind of that's what I was coming to mine.
[00:17:45] So I tabled it because I felt like a stuck.
[00:17:47] I don't know what to do with this.
[00:17:49] And I then started thinking about podcasts.
[00:17:53] And I was like, oh, wait a second.
[00:17:54] A podcast is way easier to start because it's just audio.
[00:17:58] I don't have to worry about the video.
[00:17:59] I can just get a business owner on the other side of the mic
[00:18:03] and ask them questions.
[00:18:05] And it's actually inexpensive to start up too
[00:18:07] with like the hosting platforms.
[00:18:09] So then I was like, okay, cool.
[00:18:12] I'll work on that.
[00:18:13] Well, I didn't get into it right away.
[00:18:17] It was like an idea I had that kind of set there
[00:18:19] for a couple more months.
[00:18:20] And I started 2020 and I was,
[00:18:22] I've been working with a business coach since the fall of 2019.
[00:18:26] So when we started 2020 and I was sharing these goals,
[00:18:29] he was like, okay, what do we got to do for you?
[00:18:32] You got to get this started.
[00:18:34] Like you've been holding on to this for too long.
[00:18:36] So I'm slowly but surely kind of putting these thoughts together
[00:18:40] to make the plan a launch podcast and then COVID happened.
[00:18:45] So I was like, oh, in our whole world's changed.
[00:18:49] So then I thought this is definitely a time
[00:18:53] that people need to be reminded about some whole business.
[00:18:55] Yeah, by local.
[00:18:57] Yeah.
[00:18:57] It's, I think it motivated me to, okay,
[00:19:00] we got to do launches podcasts.
[00:19:02] Like this is needed if we're doing this.
[00:19:03] So it's kind of how how it was born.
[00:19:07] So and I love it.
[00:19:09] And so I love this idea because you interview local artisans,
[00:19:12] local retailers, you know,
[00:19:14] just local people in the community who are important
[00:19:17] to St. Pete and the surrounding areas.
[00:19:20] And I love this because just the marketing,
[00:19:23] the marketer part of me just thinks this is such a brilliant strategy
[00:19:26] because what you're doing is what,
[00:19:28] what a lot of these like shop owners are constantly receiving
[00:19:31] this communication from ad agencies,
[00:19:34] people who want to sell them advertising.
[00:19:36] People that want to say, hey,
[00:19:37] we'd like to put you on a billboard or radio ad or whatever.
[00:19:40] And that's going to obviously cost money.
[00:19:43] Whereas you're basically contacting these retailers
[00:19:46] saying, I really love your store.
[00:19:47] I like what you do.
[00:19:48] I would love to just have a chat with you on my show
[00:19:52] and kind of introduce you to my audience.
[00:19:54] And you're basically giving them free marketing
[00:19:57] and free advertising.
[00:19:59] And also, so obviously that's a super generous thing to do.
[00:20:03] And it's part of you supporting your local community.
[00:20:06] Also, you're probably very rarely going to get a,
[00:20:09] nah, I'm not interested because there's no real downside, right?
[00:20:13] And then also when you are sharing these podcasts,
[00:20:17] you're, I'm sure you're tagging in the businesses
[00:20:19] or the business owners like, hey, by the way,
[00:20:21] if you want to promote this to your followers
[00:20:24] or your shoppers,
[00:20:26] it's really a brilliant strategy all the way around.
[00:20:29] I'm curious, not that you're doing it to get business,
[00:20:32] you're doing it to really support these local merchants
[00:20:35] and their services, which I think is ultra noble.
[00:20:39] And I love that.
[00:20:40] I'm just curious, has it also resulted in people
[00:20:42] knowing you more in the community
[00:20:44] and has that actually resulted in business?
[00:20:48] Yeah, so it's kind of, I think there's like a two-fold answer
[00:20:51] to that because number one,
[00:20:53] it plays back into the overall brand strategy.
[00:20:57] I've been working very hard at trying to build
[00:20:59] an online presence and build my personal brand.
[00:21:03] So it rolls back into that in a really nice way.
[00:21:09] I'll get referrals from agents across the country
[00:21:13] and only because they found me online
[00:21:15] and saw my online presence.
[00:21:17] Oh, that's interesting.
[00:21:19] 
[00:21:20] So there's that piece to it.
[00:21:22] But then from like a very literal sense,
[00:21:25] the relationships that I'm making
[00:21:27] from the people I have on my podcast,
[00:21:31] whether it's something that happened right away,
[00:21:34] because like I said, this is my fourth year.
[00:21:35] So that whenever you're building relationships,
[00:21:38] it takes time to build that trust,
[00:21:40] no like a trust factor.
[00:21:43] And so this past year in 2022,
[00:21:45] I will say I had two transactions
[00:21:49] that I can directly link back from a guest
[00:21:53] that I had on my podcast.
[00:21:54] So like a very direct,
[00:21:56] like you know, this is the lead source that generated.
[00:22:00] Yeah.
[00:22:00] Hey, listen to your show.
[00:22:01] I'm reaching out to you that kind of thing.
[00:22:03] Yeah.
[00:22:03] Yeah, like actually this were two guests
[00:22:06] that I had on my podcast.
[00:22:07] So then the indirect part of it from,
[00:22:11] you know, people that have reached out to me
[00:22:13] that have been listening to the podcast,
[00:22:15] you know, more just more relationships.
[00:22:17] I mean, the more conversations you have,
[00:22:19] the better chance you have for, you know,
[00:22:22] bringing in those transactions.
[00:22:24] So yeah.
[00:22:25] We're any other REALTORS having a similar type of show,
[00:22:29] another podcast that you were competing,
[00:22:32] a nothing, I don't always think podcasts compete
[00:22:34] with each other,
[00:22:34] but were you kind of the first person to do that
[00:22:36] in the St. Pete area?
[00:22:38] That's a real estate agent.
[00:22:40] I think so.
[00:22:41] I mean, I researched it to a degree
[00:22:43] and I really didn't see anything like that online.
[00:22:47] So I believe so.
[00:22:50] I mean, there's definitely some other agents
[00:22:51] that do really good video content in our area.
[00:22:55] But from the podcast perspective,
[00:22:57] I'm, I guess I was a pioneer in that.
[00:23:01] I don't know.
[00:23:02] I mean, it's really funny
[00:23:04] because so my sister lives in Tampa in a neighborhood
[00:23:07] or I don't know if it's a neighborhood,
[00:23:09] but in area called Palmasy, I'm sure you're familiar.
[00:23:12] And I was thinking about this,
[00:23:14] like, well, there's probably Tampa agents
[00:23:16] that already have Tampa podcasts,
[00:23:17] and I'm sure that's true.
[00:23:18] It's a much bigger area.
[00:23:19] But is there a Palmasy podcast?
[00:23:22] I don't know, probably not.
[00:23:23] And it's like, that would be,
[00:23:25] you could even just be a Palmasy podcast host
[00:23:28] if someone's listening.
[00:23:30] And I guarantee my sister who lives there would listen
[00:23:33] because she's like, I want to know what's going on
[00:23:34] in Palmasy.
[00:23:35] So you can get hyper specific.
[00:23:37] It doesn't have to have, you know,
[00:23:39] tens of thousands of followers on every episode
[00:23:41] if you're still meeting the needs of whatever the community is.
[00:23:45] And I think it's brilliant that you did that.
[00:23:47] I just love that.
[00:23:48] Well, and I'll tell you, this literally just happened to me.
[00:23:51] So a couple months ago, we were at a event
[00:23:56] and I had someone come up to me and she was like,
[00:24:00] you don't know me, but I'm so and so
[00:24:02] and I've been following your podcast for a couple of years.
[00:24:04] And I just love, you know, it was just like,
[00:24:06] she was so excited to meet me and I was like,
[00:24:08] oh, okay, wow.
[00:24:10] So what was such a cool moment to have like a fan in a sense?
[00:24:13] Yeah.
[00:24:15] And anyway, so she's a lender and she had recently moved
[00:24:19] to St. Pete.
[00:24:20] So that was kind of her like connection.
[00:24:23] And you know, we were able to continue talking
[00:24:25] and we recently got together for coffee
[00:24:27] and just to hear her say,
[00:24:30] we, me and my husband listened to your podcast
[00:24:33] and we have a date, like a date day once a week
[00:24:36] that we always try to pick places
[00:24:38] that you have in your podcast and go to.
[00:24:40] So like, my podcast is helping them find like a new spot
[00:24:43] to go.
[00:24:44] Yeah.
[00:24:45] So just stuff like that.
[00:24:47] I'm like, oh my God, that's so freaking cool.
[00:24:50] It is.
[00:24:50] It's like even if it never resulted in actual business,
[00:24:55] it's just a good feeling of like,
[00:24:57] I am providing for the community.
[00:24:59] I'm supporting the community.
[00:25:01] I'm doing it because I love, live and I love,
[00:25:04] you know, I love and I live in this community.
[00:25:07] So whether or not it ever actually translates into business,
[00:25:11] you know, it's a grind, of course,
[00:25:13] doing podcasts are not easy,
[00:25:15] but it's just hearing one person say,
[00:25:17] you know, I like your show.
[00:25:18] I listen to that is really, really heartwarming.
[00:25:22] And so I always say it's kind of one of those things
[00:25:24] that even if it doesn't generate
[00:25:27] like this huge spike in production for someone,
[00:25:31] boy, you'll get a lot of just good feelings
[00:25:32] knowing that you're helping the community.
[00:25:34] Yeah.
[00:25:35] And you gotta do stuff that fills you up,
[00:25:37] you know, because if you don't fill ourselves up,
[00:25:39] we're not gonna be able to be the best for our clients.
[00:25:43] 
[00:25:43] could not agree with you more.
[00:25:45] Okay, I want to talk, let's talk mindset.
[00:25:47] And there's something very specific about mindset
[00:25:49] that come, we talk about mindset a lot on the show
[00:25:52] and a lot of our guests, you know, reference it.
[00:25:55] And I almost don't like the word anymore
[00:25:57] because I feel like it's just one of those words
[00:25:59] that gets used very, very often
[00:26:01] without any real clear awareness of like,
[00:26:04] what does that actually mean?
[00:26:05] But I, you have a particularly like interesting story
[00:26:08] about how you're mind, how you identified a mindset issue
[00:26:13] through your coaching, I'm guessing
[00:26:14] through Tom Ferry coaching.
[00:26:16] But I tell us a little bit about what was the mindset
[00:26:19] that was stopping you?
[00:26:20] And then how did you identify it?
[00:26:22] How'd you first become aware of it?
[00:26:23] Where you were like, oh, I'm doing this thing to myself
[00:26:25] and then how did you overcome it?
[00:26:28] Yeah, I kind of fell into coaching.
[00:26:30] It was, which I, you know, I don't believe in quinsances.
[00:26:34] So I feel like God was like, here, here's your answer.
[00:26:38] So I have, I've had a history of anxiety.
[00:26:41] And so when we moved here, that was a life trigger
[00:26:45] and I was having a real school.
[00:26:48] That's tough for people with anxiety
[00:26:50] moving to a new city where they know nobody.
[00:26:52] That is a brutal one.
[00:26:54] And for the first time, I mean, you know, like I said,
[00:26:57] never lived anywhere else
[00:26:58] because I went to school in Mobile.
[00:27:00] So yeah, so I started, you know, well,
[00:27:03] I went to therapy to help myself, you know,
[00:27:06] as I make the transition, which highly recommend therapy.
[00:27:10] But getting back into real estate, you know,
[00:27:12] as I said, I started selling again in 2017
[00:27:14] and I was just kind of struggling with,
[00:27:16] I couldn't get any momentum.
[00:27:18] Like I just couldn't get that traction
[00:27:19] and get over the hump of, like I know I can be a top producing agent.
[00:27:24] Like I see it.
[00:27:25] I see that version of myself, but I can't figure out
[00:27:27] how to get there.
[00:27:29] And I met a local coach through our chamber
[00:27:33] because I'm really involved with the St. Pete Chamber
[00:27:35] and I met him just by happenstance
[00:27:37] and he started probing and asking questions.
[00:27:40] And he made an offer.
[00:27:42] He was like, I feel like you could really benefit from coaching.
[00:27:44] Would you be interested in we, and that's how we got started.
[00:27:48] And he helped me figure out that I was my own obstacle.
[00:27:53] Like it was all coming back to me.
[00:27:56] It was limiting, limiting beliefs that I had for myself.
[00:28:02] I couldn't let go of that story of, well,
[00:28:06] I haven't had much success before.
[00:28:08] So that's just going to be what it is.
[00:28:10] It's just those things that you get on repeat in your mind.
[00:28:14] I had a fixed mindset.
[00:28:17] I didn't have a question.
[00:28:17] Yeah, sort of hobbles somebody when they're,
[00:28:20] it's like I've always heard like whatever container
[00:28:22] you think your life fits in is you'll fill up that container
[00:28:26] but you won't go beyond it.
[00:28:28] And so same sort of thing with like, however long a task takes
[00:28:31] whatever amount of time you set for it,
[00:28:33] you'll eventually just go to that whatever amount of time.
[00:28:36] So this idea of not even acknowledging or understanding
[00:28:40] that there's this sort of box that's limiting
[00:28:42] because there's anxiety, there's fear,
[00:28:46] there's real feelings that are coming up that are based in reality.
[00:28:50] It's not like some people have anxiety that's not based in reality
[00:28:54] but yours obviously is based in reality.
[00:28:56] So there's a lot of reason to take that anxiety on
[00:29:00] because you're like, no, this is a real thing that's happening.
[00:29:03] How did you, how did you start to move past that?
[00:29:06] You know, it's just, it's really tough work.
[00:29:11] It takes a lot of time to reprogram your brain.
[00:29:16] And you know, like with anything, you have to be consistent.
[00:29:20] And I think some people kind of, they're like,
[00:29:22] okay, cool, I'm going to meditate and do some affirmations
[00:29:25] but then they don't stick with it.
[00:29:26] It's like you're never going to see the results.
[00:29:28] If you don't do it consistently.
[00:29:30] So through my coach and also I've been to ninja selling.
[00:29:36] So I've done the ninja selling installation,
[00:29:38] which mine sets a really big part of what they teach.
[00:29:42] So learning some of those practices I would say
[00:29:45] from a daily basis really helped me.
[00:29:48] So that morning routine of writing and reading affirmation,
[00:29:54] positive affirmations, meditation, you know,
[00:29:57] it's really just, it sounds so, it sounds so simple,
[00:30:00] but it's not, but it's like the basic steps
[00:30:04] that if you keep doing them over and over again,
[00:30:06] you will reprogram your brain.
[00:30:08] Because that's how our brains work.
[00:30:10] You know, our non-conscious brain can't take a joke.
[00:30:13] So it's going to, whatever you feed it,
[00:30:15] it's going to feed back to you.
[00:30:16] So if you keep feeding it positive stuff eventually,
[00:30:18] it starts to, you know, reprogram.
[00:30:21] So agreed.
[00:30:23] And there's most of our programming comes from mom and dad
[00:30:26] when we were little and a lot of it is just not helpful anymore.
[00:30:32] But it's so deeply ingrained.
[00:30:34] And I think that's where good therapy can kind of say,
[00:30:37] okay, I see that you were running this old pattern
[00:30:41] that doesn't really make sense anymore based on your family
[00:30:44] history. This makes perfect sense to a therapist,
[00:30:46] but to an individual they might go, God,
[00:30:49] how do I keep sabotaging or why am I keeping,
[00:30:51] why do I think I'm worthless or why do I think I can't make it?
[00:30:54] Well, that's because somehow you pick that up as a child
[00:30:57] from something or somewhere or whatever.
[00:30:59] And it just is unresolved and it manifests in things like anxiety
[00:31:03] and in certain types of behavior.
[00:31:06] I didn't know I was in anxious.
[00:31:07] I mean, this is so funny because everyone in my life
[00:31:09] knows me as an anxious person.
[00:31:11] I didn't know that I've been in therapy for a million years.
[00:31:13] I just in the last two or three years have identified,
[00:31:16] oh my gosh, I'm a really an anxious person.
[00:31:19] And I've had to learn how to self-soothe
[00:31:21] and how to cope with anxiety and ride it out.
[00:31:25] And know that it feels real.
[00:31:29] And it's a real thing that's happening to me,
[00:31:31] but it doesn't mean that it's actually happening
[00:31:33] in real life coming in.
[00:31:36] So anyway, the point is, is that journey
[00:31:38] is a really important journey, I think, to go on
[00:31:40] because most people probably aren't that aware
[00:31:44] of their limiting mindsets or their limiting beliefs
[00:31:47] or some of these things.
[00:31:49] And boy, if you can get out of your own way,
[00:31:51] life just gets a lot easier.
[00:31:53] Yeah, I always think about that quote, Jim Rohn quote,
[00:31:58] about your level of success rarely exceeds your level
[00:32:04] of personal development, something like that.
[00:32:06] I'm not saying that correctly,
[00:32:07] but that's kind of what I realized was
[00:32:10] by spending time on myself,
[00:32:13] then I was, like I said,
[00:32:18] reprogramming and it's just,
[00:32:20] it's that domino effect, that snowball,
[00:32:23] it just starts to, over time, work its way through
[00:32:27] and it becomes like this repeatable, consistent thing.
[00:32:33] And it's almost like working a muscle,
[00:32:35] you know, to get that muscle memory
[00:32:36] and you get, it just becomes more natural to,
[00:32:39] instead of staying in the negative,
[00:32:42] you automatically flip to the positive.
[00:32:44] So it just takes that repetition over and over and over again.
[00:32:48] Yeah, it takes a tremendous dedication and a commitment
[00:32:51] and a lot of you, like you said,
[00:32:53] I consider it harder than digging ditches,
[00:32:56] but it really is.
[00:32:58] I mean, it takes a, and it's exhausting to do.
[00:33:02] That being said, it's really the most important work
[00:33:05] anybody can do, you know, take care of your,
[00:33:08] you take care of your, not you, I'm saying in general,
[00:33:10] we think we wanna take care of our physical health,
[00:33:12] I'm sure you do that as well.
[00:33:13] But, you know, we don't always think,
[00:33:15] well, I'm going to the gym three times a week,
[00:33:17] what am I doing for my mind?
[00:33:19] What am I actually doing to sort of explore and,
[00:33:22] and, you know, look, nobody's mom and dad were perfect.
[00:33:25] So there are lots of wounds that every single person
[00:33:29] on this planet has, and you can start to identify
[00:33:32] and go into and there's, you know,
[00:33:35] all sorts of professionals that can help you sort of navigate
[00:33:37] those waters.
[00:33:38] But I'm glad you're talking about it.
[00:33:40] I think that's really, really important.
[00:33:41] And I, every single person in our podcast deals
[00:33:44] with some sort of level of anxiety,
[00:33:46] especially when they're new to the business
[00:33:47] or they're meeting, you know, maybe they've never done
[00:33:50] a million dollar sale and they have their first
[00:33:51] listing presentation with, you know, somebody that seems
[00:33:55] like it's, oh, I don't think they're gonna choose me.
[00:33:57] There's a lot of that, that is totally normal, totally okay.
[00:34:02] And there's solutions that help through that.
[00:34:05] And then once you get through it and you realize,
[00:34:07] oh, that didn't swallow me up, it didn't kill me.
[00:34:09] Oh, I might actually be able to tolerate
[00:34:11] some of these challenges.
[00:34:16] I would love to talk about, so you talked about the morning
[00:34:21] and I know that REALTORS, there's a book, Miracle Morning,
[00:34:24] that like every REALTOR loves, yes, there's a lot.
[00:34:27] Well, how ill rods book, I've yet to meet anyone
[00:34:30] who was like, yeah, that just doesn't work.
[00:34:32] So I'm going to assume on the 90,000 people
[00:34:35] that have told me about this book and I've read it as well,
[00:34:39] that it is a really good idea.
[00:34:41] Can you talk a little bit about how you structure your mornings?
[00:34:43] You talked about meditation, journaling, things like that.
[00:34:46] Are you still doing those things?
[00:34:48] Yeah, so with Ninja selling installation,
[00:34:51] it taught me a lot about starting the day with gratitude.
[00:34:54] So gratitude and affirmation was kind of my first way
[00:34:58] into having a morning routine.
[00:35:00] And I saw immediate results with that.
[00:35:03] Because again, you're getting yourself out of a negative state
[00:35:06] by waking up watching the news or being on social media,
[00:35:10] but staying in a positive state.
[00:35:12] And then I would say in the past year,
[00:35:15] I learned about how ill rod in the Miracle Morning,
[00:35:18] and that took into a whole other level for me.
[00:35:22] So I've been doing the Miracle Morning
[00:35:23] for several months.
[00:35:26] And like there's an app, so it's easy to stay on top of.
[00:35:30] And just combining like a commitment to the gratitude
[00:35:33] and affirmation, which was already important to me,
[00:35:36] but the silence, which having like a daily devotional
[00:35:40] reading my Bible, praying, that's another really big aspect
[00:35:43] for me, and the reading a book,
[00:35:46] which is usually a personal, something personal development
[00:35:49] wise and exercise.
[00:35:51] So it's like putting all that stuff together
[00:35:54] was definitely took that to another level for me.
[00:35:57] So.
[00:35:58] Yeah, I think we're talking about process, right?
[00:36:01] So we have now a process that you can follow each morning.
[00:36:06] It's not wake up and what do I feel like doing
[00:36:09] as much as before I start my day,
[00:36:12] I have these things that really help ground me,
[00:36:16] center me, and look, people's,
[00:36:19] look, all of our lives are chaotic, right?
[00:36:21] We have things going on in our personal lives.
[00:36:24] We have things bouncing around in our heads,
[00:36:26] with spouses, children, other financial situations,
[00:36:30] all sorts of conflict and challenge.
[00:36:32] And those are things that just, that's just what happens.
[00:36:34] That's just part of life.
[00:36:35] And those things can bounce around in my head, at least,
[00:36:38] and I can wake up.
[00:36:41] And if I'm not intentional about what I'm focused,
[00:36:46] gonna focus on today, those anxieties about all of those things
[00:36:50] that are uncomfortable or scary to me,
[00:36:53] really take the forefront and jump in front,
[00:36:55] and kind of run the show and color the way that I approach
[00:36:59] the rest of the day.
[00:37:00] So having this process in the morning that says,
[00:37:02] it's not that I'm avoiding those things,
[00:37:03] I'm gonna take care of those things.
[00:37:04] I'm gonna, you know, I'm not, I'm not being polyanna,
[00:37:07] but I'm also, by the way, even though I don't feel like doing it
[00:37:10] right now, I'm gonna journal, or I'm gonna meditate,
[00:37:12] or I'm going to pray, or read, or whatever it might be
[00:37:15] to help sort of, you realize, you know, life has all sorts
[00:37:19] of ups and downs, and you can structure some self-care
[00:37:25] in that morning, and then you can tackle the anxiety
[00:37:28] and stuff later.
[00:37:30] So I just think that is such a brilliant strategy.
[00:37:33] So I applaud you for, I need to start doing the miracle morning.
[00:37:36] I need to start doing it.
[00:37:39] It's wonderful.
[00:37:40] And it helped me get up earlier,
[00:37:42] because that was, I struggled with that, just like,
[00:37:44] I don't have kids, so I didn't, you know,
[00:37:47] I didn't have that motivator to get up earlier with kids.
[00:37:50] Sure.
[00:37:50] I would find myself, you know, sleeping in too long,
[00:37:54] just to not like sleeping in really late,
[00:37:56] but just to where, you feel like you're starting the day behind,
[00:37:58] you know?
[00:37:59] And so that was, you know, getting up earlier
[00:38:03] than I had been, you know, like 645,
[00:38:06] which I know some people get up way earlier than that,
[00:38:08] but for me, 645 was like, all right, this is a milestone.
[00:38:11] I'm doing this.
[00:38:11] I can do this.
[00:38:13] So that's been great, because it's just giving me time back.
[00:38:16] You know, I'm getting my day set up, like you're saying,
[00:38:19] being intentional, and I think it just helped,
[00:38:22] I think when you get your day started like that,
[00:38:25] it just helps the whole rest of the day go way better
[00:38:29] and be able to tackle, it comes your way.
[00:38:32] I could not agree more.
[00:38:33] I told my girlfriend if she ever sees me, or hears me,
[00:38:38] and she hears me do this a lot,
[00:38:40] go into like a negative rant where I'm like,
[00:38:42] really fired up about something,
[00:38:45] if I'm going on too long, like it's one thing
[00:38:48] to have an expression of anger or whatever,
[00:38:50] or be upset about something that's perfectly okay.
[00:38:52] I'm not here to tell people they can't have negative feelings,
[00:38:55] because of course, you should have negative feelings.
[00:38:57] They're really important.
[00:38:58] But if you've, if I said to my girlfriend,
[00:39:01] sometimes I get swallowed up a little bit in them,
[00:39:03] and I don't realize that I'm really like,
[00:39:05] okay, I've been going on for 15 minutes
[00:39:07] about something that's like just not that important.
[00:39:09] So I said, if you catch me doing that,
[00:39:11] can you just put your finger up in the air,
[00:39:13] and that'll be my cue to stop what I'm saying,
[00:39:18] and immediately say, as bad as things seem right now,
[00:39:22] I got to list three things that are going really well
[00:39:24] in my life, you know, and it doesn't mean the other thing
[00:39:27] that's not going well is gone.
[00:39:29] It just means I'm trying to balance it and realize,
[00:39:32] it's not all bad, and it's not all good.
[00:39:35] It's kind of in the middle, and I can acknowledge both things,
[00:39:37] but I have to get out of that repetition,
[00:39:40] because I grew up in a, my family,
[00:39:44] lovely, amazing people, but they were more critical
[00:39:47] than I would have preferred.
[00:39:49] So I'm just kind of used to being super critical.
[00:39:51] So I have to have these little interruptions that go,
[00:39:54] hey, okay, yeah, you should be critical in a minute,
[00:39:57] but for now, let's at least think about some things
[00:39:59] that are actually going really well.
[00:40:01] So those are your giving power to, I mean.
[00:40:05] You're right.
[00:40:06] You're giving power to that negative negativity,
[00:40:10] and then it just becomes this monster
[00:40:12] that like takes over.
[00:40:15] It can, yeah, and it's really awesome to be able
[00:40:18] to acknowledge something without giving it power.
[00:40:21] Like you're like, no, I know you're still there,
[00:40:24] and I know that's still a problem,
[00:40:25] and I know we'll figure out a solution,
[00:40:28] but it's not gonna swallow me up,
[00:40:29] it's not gonna take over my day,
[00:40:31] and it's not gonna ruin my day.
[00:40:32] I'm gonna try to, you know, try to persevere
[00:40:37] in the face of any sort of obstacle,
[00:40:39] and that's where a good coach can come in, right?
[00:40:42] Like a therapist, a coach,
[00:40:44] somebody who can say, hey, I noticed you're not doing this thing,
[00:40:47] that would be really helpful for you.
[00:40:48] What's going on?
[00:40:49] What's stopping you?
[00:40:50] Well, I don't wanna do it.
[00:40:51] Okay, and then you can start from there, you know,
[00:40:53] and kind of identify what's been missing.
[00:40:58] So I love all of this.
[00:41:00] I think this is so well said, a quick,
[00:41:03] so I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about 2023,
[00:41:06] because I have a little bugaboo in the industry,
[00:41:09] because anyone who's paying attention,
[00:41:11] not every market is this way,
[00:41:13] but most markets in the country,
[00:41:16] I just wanna be really honest about it.
[00:41:18] I think this is gonna be a tough year for REALTORS.
[00:41:20] It just is, rates are high, inventory's low.
[00:41:22] It's just, you know, for a lot of us,
[00:41:24] it's going to be a more difficult year
[00:41:26] than it was a year and a half ago.
[00:41:28] I think most of us would agree,
[00:41:30] that's a reasonable statement.
[00:41:31] Doesn't mean it can't be a great year.
[00:41:33] It's just gonna be a tough year, at least I think so.
[00:41:36] I am curious, what are you doing this year
[00:41:40] to stay on top of it, to stay active,
[00:41:43] to, you know, the markets shifted and changed?
[00:41:46] What are you doing to sort of stay on top of things
[00:41:48] so that you're not like, again, just taking in all this,
[00:41:52] oh, it's gonna be a brutal year
[00:41:53] and then sort of letting that not let you,
[00:41:55] you know, sort of take action.
[00:41:57] Yeah, I mean, I think one of the biggest things
[00:41:59] that I've learned in the last couple of years
[00:42:01] is what am I in control of versus what am I not in control of?
[00:42:06] And we're always in control of...
[00:42:07] Prayer of Saint Francis, speaking back to prayers.
[00:42:10] Yeah, so we're always in control of our thoughts
[00:42:14] and our actions.
[00:42:16] And what I fall back to whenever I start to feel
[00:42:20] some of that negativity like when we hear, okay,
[00:42:22] hey, it's gonna be a tougher year.
[00:42:25] You're gonna need to double down and do more
[00:42:27] to get kind of the same results is just getting in action.
[00:42:32] All right, I'm gonna get super focused on what I need to be doing
[00:42:37] and I'm gonna double down on, which for me,
[00:42:40] I'm just focused on having more conversations.
[00:42:43] I love it.
[00:42:44] That's kind of my, you know, that's my focus for this year
[00:42:48] and I always break things down into like months and quarters.
[00:42:52] So, because again, wanna be like super intentional and focused
[00:42:55] and I don't wanna have like this overarching goal
[00:42:57] for the year and then not know what to do.
[00:43:00] I wanna like strategize and make that actionable.
[00:43:02] So, you know, just having more conversations,
[00:43:06] getting in front of people and I think that also
[00:43:07] goes back to that brand strategy.
[00:43:11] You know, I think some people when they hear negative news
[00:43:14] about the market, they just kind of stick their head
[00:43:16] in the sand and then they stop doing things
[00:43:18] and I choose to have an abundant mindset.
[00:43:21] I mean, so I'm gonna keep moving forward
[00:43:24] and I'm gonna keep, you know, pursuing my marketing channels.
[00:43:27] I'm gonna have my podcast, I'm gonna make videos.
[00:43:29] Videos is a big part of that strategy for me this year.
[00:43:33] So, I'm gonna keep putting myself out there
[00:43:36] and there's always a market and every market,
[00:43:39] there's a market, you know, like there's always people
[00:43:41] that are out there that have to buy and sell.
[00:43:43] It's life, people move.
[00:43:46] You know, you gotta live somewhere.
[00:43:48] Relocation, people move, you know,
[00:43:50] obviously marriages and unfortunately,
[00:43:52] negative things like divorce and people that pass away.
[00:43:56] So, you know, it just can't stick your head in the sand,
[00:44:00] you gotta get out there and take action
[00:44:03] and it's that snowball effect.
[00:44:06] When she gets that momentum, when she get going,
[00:44:08] it starts to, you know, roll faster and faster.
[00:44:12] And yeah, and I'll give everyone who's listening
[00:44:15] a couple of predictions that I pretty sure
[00:44:18] are gonna come true, that will make you feel
[00:44:20] a little better about this year.
[00:44:21] Number one, lots of agents will leave the industry.
[00:44:24] I know this because we own a holding company
[00:44:26] which is for agents who are leaving the industry
[00:44:28] and we had within the last year,
[00:44:33] we've added 250 new agents to the whole,
[00:44:36] I mean, it used to have 500 agents in it
[00:44:39] and now it has almost 800 agents.
[00:44:43] And that's just been within the last year
[00:44:44] and as much as that pains me to see people
[00:44:47] leaving the industry for people that are committed
[00:44:49] and still working in the business and on the business,
[00:44:52] it's actually a really good thing for everyone
[00:44:54] who stays in because you can pick up some market share,
[00:44:58] of course, lots of people will not have REALTORS
[00:45:01] that are still in the business that they, you know,
[00:45:04] there's a lot of people that will just be up for grabs
[00:45:05] and so if you can double down, especially,
[00:45:08] and I love that you broke it down
[00:45:09] into the most sort of basic activity for you
[00:45:12] which is probably the most important activity
[00:45:14] for all REALTORS, I would imagine, is having conversations.
[00:45:19] So do you have like a certain goal you talked about
[00:45:21] having, you know, a certain amount per quarter
[00:45:23] or per month, do you also have like a per day goals?
[00:45:26] Like I really wanna have X number of conversations per day.
[00:45:29] Yeah, I kinda have it by week
[00:45:32] and really, I've always had that in the back of my head
[00:45:36] but this year I was like, I'm gonna track this.
[00:45:40] Like I have whiteboards in my office
[00:45:41] and so I put up on the whiteboard, like, you know,
[00:45:44] these are the number of fire and fire and seller,
[00:45:48] like, you know, fire consultation,
[00:45:50] seller listing consultation appointments
[00:45:51] that I wanna have for this year
[00:45:53] and then these are the amount of conversations
[00:45:56] that I wanna have per week.
[00:45:58] So I'm like, just, you know, checking those off on the board
[00:46:01] and for each week.
[00:46:03] So I, you know, what gets measured gets managed.
[00:46:07] So it's like just having that in front of me
[00:46:09] in a really visual way, I think it's gonna help
[00:46:11] because I just, like I said, it's kind of known
[00:46:13] that's there and that's in metric
[00:46:15] but I'm gonna really track it.
[00:46:17] So that's what I'm doing.
[00:46:18] I wanna dive just a little deeper into your conversations
[00:46:20] because I know whenever we, whenever we've had a
[00:46:25] guests on the show and they talk about conversations,
[00:46:27] I've always failed to ask this question.
[00:46:30] When you say conversation,
[00:46:31] what specifically are, what defines a conversation
[00:46:35] in your mind since you are measuring it?
[00:46:37] Yeah, I mean, to me, it's just a meaningful conversation.
[00:46:41] So whether that's me calling a client, a past client
[00:46:45] and I leave a voicemail because it's an answer,
[00:46:47] it still counts because I'm still touching them.
[00:46:51] I mean, it's just having a meaningful conversation.
[00:46:53] So that, or if I go to a networking event,
[00:46:55] I'm getting like 10 conversations at one time, you know,
[00:46:58] for the whole evening.
[00:46:59] And so I'm sorry to jump in.
[00:47:02] Does it have to be a real estate conversation
[00:47:04] or could it be anything related to just life in general?
[00:47:08] Just having, you know, talking to someone like you care,
[00:47:12] and they're a real person, you know,
[00:47:13] hey, what's going on with you?
[00:47:15] Do you have any vacation plans this year?
[00:47:17] Oh, okay, your daughter's graduating,
[00:47:20] like just diving into life with people
[00:47:24] because that's how you build that rapport.
[00:47:26] I mean, in real estate always comes up at some point
[00:47:30] because people love to talk about real estate.
[00:47:32] So you don't have to worry about bringing up
[00:47:35] or a real estate.
[00:47:37] 
[00:47:38] So just being a human, I think that's what it comes down to.
[00:47:41] But isn't that the best news of all
[00:47:44] that that is all you have to do is show interest
[00:47:48] in someone, demonstrate that you care about them.
[00:47:51] And you should obviously, you should only do it authentically.
[00:47:54] If you do it in authentically, it's not going to work.
[00:47:57] But it doesn't have to be,
[00:47:59] it doesn't have to be this pressure of like,
[00:48:01] oh, I know everything about the St. Peter'sburg real estate market.
[00:48:04] And I know every fact and figure, you know, maybe you do.
[00:48:07] But, you know, most agents don't feel that way
[00:48:10] about their, you know, the area they work
[00:48:11] and maybe they are like, oh, if I talk about it,
[00:48:13] I might not have an answer for you.
[00:48:15] You don't have to talk about real estate, right?
[00:48:17] Like you should know enough to be able to have a conversation
[00:48:19] that's to keep that going.
[00:48:22] But you can also, you know, I always love social media,
[00:48:25] I think is particularly good for this
[00:48:27] because if you see somebody who's gone on vacation,
[00:48:29] you know, instead of just being the REALTOR,
[00:48:31] that's like, I just listed this home
[00:48:32] and I just sold this home and look at how cool I am.
[00:48:35] I personally, that's, that's, that doesn't speak to me.
[00:48:39] That sort of advertising, and I'm not putting people down,
[00:48:41] I'm sort of sounded like I was putting agents down
[00:48:43] who do that.
[00:48:44] And I really, I, that is not what my intention is.
[00:48:48] And I think you should absolutely brag
[00:48:50] about your accomplishments.
[00:48:51] I think that's an okay thing.
[00:48:52] But I like the idea of social media to go the other way
[00:48:56] where you could be like, oh, I saw you just went
[00:48:57] on this vacation, tell me about it.
[00:48:59] Yep.
[00:49:00] And people love that because then they, of course,
[00:49:02] you care, you actually paid attention.
[00:49:05] I mean, you know, people always want like,
[00:49:09] if you want to talk about themselves,
[00:49:10] you know, they want to know that you're interested.
[00:49:13] I mean, that's how we work.
[00:49:14] So just showing interest in people
[00:49:16] and to your point of saying like, do it authentically.
[00:49:19] I mean, that's a huge part of it.
[00:49:21] And it just, it goes back to building a brand.
[00:49:24] It's like, just be yourself.
[00:49:26] Like you, you gotta be yourself.
[00:49:28] You can't be afraid to be yourself
[00:49:29] because if you put yourself out there authentically,
[00:49:32] you're gonna, your vibe attract your tribe.
[00:49:33] You're gonna get people back that are like minded like you.
[00:49:38] So I agreed.
[00:49:39] And you're right.
[00:49:40] There's enough business for everybody,
[00:49:42] even if agents aren't exiting the industry this year,
[00:49:46] which they will be.
[00:49:47] But even if everyone was flooding into the market this year,
[00:49:50] and it was gonna be twice as many agents,
[00:49:53] you know, people could still have incredibly successful years.
[00:49:56] But I think this is the year of action.
[00:49:58] I think action will overcome some of these, you know,
[00:50:02] again, to quote the prayer of St. Francis,
[00:50:04] like things we can't control market conditions, et cetera.
[00:50:08] Those are things outside of our control.
[00:50:10] But what we can control is our effort and our action.
[00:50:13] And all we really ever have to do is real estate agents
[00:50:17] is get people to no like and trust us.
[00:50:19] That's not an easy thing to do, but that is your goal.
[00:50:23] If you can, if people no like and trust you,
[00:50:25] they will choose you as their agent.
[00:50:28] Or they're going to choose somebody they no like and trust.
[00:50:30] And you want to be on that short list.
[00:50:33] So I think this is just amazing.
[00:50:36] And so for everyone who's listening,
[00:50:38] I want you to check out Britney's podcast.
[00:50:40] And if you're like, well, I don't live in St. Pete.
[00:50:42] I don't really care about the restaurants in St. Pete.
[00:50:45] That's not the reason I want you to check it out.
[00:50:47] I want you to check it out to see what she's doing
[00:50:50] and how she's affecting her community
[00:50:54] and why that might be something that you may want to consider
[00:50:57] for your local community.
[00:50:59] It is a brilliant strategy.
[00:51:01] This, my podcast was based out of a very similar principle,
[00:51:05] which is I just want to provide value to other agents
[00:51:08] by talking to top agents like Britney.
[00:51:10] That was five years ago.
[00:51:12] I was unsure if anyone would listen.
[00:51:15] And here we are now all these episodes later.
[00:51:17] And thankfully we have incredible listeners
[00:51:20] and people who are really, really appreciative of what we do.
[00:51:24] And that's not to put a feather in my cap.
[00:51:27] But what I will tell you is it has helped me
[00:51:30] in my business of recruiting agents.
[00:51:32] I don't use this to recruit agents,
[00:51:34] but obviously we have almost 800 agents
[00:51:37] that are company here.
[00:51:38] And a lot of them come over because they listen
[00:51:40] to our show.
[00:51:41] So yes, you will likely see a benefit to your business
[00:51:45] down the road.
[00:51:46] But boy, you're going to help the community along the way.
[00:51:48] So check out Britney's podcast.
[00:51:51] Also, a lot of people retire to Florida.
[00:51:55] Why?
[00:51:56] Because state taxes are really, really impressive.
[00:51:59] A lot of people move to Florida at some point in their lives.
[00:52:03] I'm in Illinois.
[00:52:04] So we have a lot of people who spend there, like my parents,
[00:52:07] they spend basically their winters there now.
[00:52:09] And we'll probably eventually move down there
[00:52:12] for those tax benefits as well.
[00:52:14] So a lot of people move to Florida.
[00:52:16] And you probably know people in your sphere
[00:52:19] that are also moving.
[00:52:20] And you can connect with Britney
[00:52:22] because you can say, not only do I have a great REALTOR
[00:52:25] in C&B, she actually hosts like this great podcast
[00:52:28] where she's like super connected to the whole community.
[00:52:31] She knows all the best areas, the best places to go
[00:52:34] and visit.
[00:52:34] And she would be a great resource.
[00:52:36] So this could be a great referral source for you.
[00:52:38] So if you have clients that are considering making that transition,
[00:52:43] Britney, what's the best way an agent should reach out to you?
[00:52:47] I would say shoot me an email if you're an agent.
[00:52:51] That I'll see it faster.
[00:52:53] So that's Britney.renew at premiercer.com.
[00:52:58] So that's premiercer.
[00:52:59] SIR short for SETTABEE's International Realty.
[00:53:02] So yeah, shoot me an email, follow me on Instagram,
[00:53:05] send me a DM.
[00:53:07] Yeah, any way I would love to connect.
[00:53:11] Yeah, and I just think I always love this idea
[00:53:14] of when you make a referral,
[00:53:15] you really want to know that the other person's going to take
[00:53:19] great care of the client.
[00:53:21] And with the fact that you're so integrated
[00:53:23] with the St. Pete community with different boards
[00:53:27] and just also with your podcast,
[00:53:30] I would be very comfortable without ever knowing
[00:53:33] how you've treated a client.
[00:53:35] I would be comfortable sending a client to you
[00:53:37] because I'm like, oh, she's really dialed in.
[00:53:40] She knows stuff and she's an important person
[00:53:43] in that community, whether Britney,
[00:53:45] whether you think you are or not.
[00:53:46] You know, I know that you are.
[00:53:48] So guys, this is how you can build,
[00:53:51] you can build this exact same brand for yourself
[00:53:54] in your local community.
[00:53:57] And you can use things like podcasts, video.
[00:54:00] It doesn't have to be a podcast.
[00:54:01] You could do just video stuff on Facebook.
[00:54:03] But whatever you want to do,
[00:54:05] be of service to your community.
[00:54:08] And you will find that over time,
[00:54:10] people really, really appreciate it.
[00:54:12] And more business.
[00:54:14] So if you have somebody that's looking to move to Florida,
[00:54:17] Southern Tampa, St. Pete,
[00:54:20] or Clearwater, rather,
[00:54:22] anywhere around that area,
[00:54:24] definitely reach out to Britney.
[00:54:25] And if she can't help, she'll know who to send you to.
[00:54:28] But she would be the first place that I would go.
[00:54:30] So everybody, visit her website.
[00:54:33] You can find all things Britney at BritneyRenew.com.
[00:54:37] Again, that's B-R-I-T-T-A-N-Y-R-A-N-E-W.

Brittany, welcome to the show. Hi, DJ, thanks for having me. I appreciate it. I get very nervous when I talk to other podcast hosts. And when people hear this final version, they won't know that I screwed up three times in my introduction to you. So I am a little frazzled right now. So I have to get back to my center or else I am gonna be, it's funny, I get very nervous. Like I can't screw up in front of another broadcast. Oh God. But I did. Well, I think this is great. It's actually a great segue into what we're eventually gonna talk about, which are one of the topics with being mindset. So we'll get to a place where maybe I can take a lesson from you and learn how to quiet the voices in my head that are telling me I'm screwing this up. But before we get to me, let's talk about you. And I would love to hear one, actually I don't know this story as how you got into real estate. So if you don't mind sharing that. Yeah. So kind of an interesting path. I have a music background. So I actually went to school for music. I was a vocal major. Wow. Did you do that in Florida or somewhere else? So I'm from Mobile, Alabama, originally in Hornet Ray. So it was a local school there. And so we moved to St. Pete 2015. So I just like my husband and I born to raise a mobile and took a leap and moved to St. Pete. So yeah. So did you have dreams of being like a singer? Did you want to sing professionally or? I did. And I had a writing background as well. So definitely in that creative space. Sure. And so I was like, well, you know what? I'm not going to be a professional singer. At least at this moment in time. So why don't I pursue the music industry on the business side? So there is a local company, media company that I started working for a mobile. I mentioned having a creative side. So that was something I wanted to have my own business. So I started a vent planning company. So I was doing that on the side while it worked full time at this media company. And that was like, so we grow and kind of get in my feet with. And then I got laid off for my job after they sold to another company and closed down operations in mobile. So I was like, oh, what am I supposed to do with myself now? I mean, I'm young at my first real full time job at a college. So it was kind of traumatic to get laid off. So I had the vent planning company. And I was like, you know what? I've always loved houses. Real estate sounds like something else that I could really make my own. So I got my real estate license. It was I was doing both trying to build real estate, had the vent planning company. Then that wasn't really going the way I wanted it to. And I was starting to fall in love with real estate. I was like, you know what? I'm going to just go all in in real estate. And that was in about I got licensed in 2013, end of 13 and 2014 is where I really kind of like went full time. Yeah, it's that's a quite a shift. But I guess with the event planning background and the media company background, it probably, especially you doing your own event planning, I imagine that probably was that the sort of first entrepreneurial thing that you did where you're like, okay, I want to be in charge of my own life in my own time and all of that. Yeah. And my husband was in kind of a not so great work environment. And I was like, you know what? If I have my own business that it's limitless, I can do whatever I want. You know, the income is limitless. And so I just had these dreams of like, all right, I'm going to help us build this different life, you know, life that we always imagined. And things didn't go exactly as planned. It was a lot slower growth than I wanted it to be, which came back to my mindset, but I didn't know that at the time. So when we moved to St.P, it was a job opportunity for my husband, Stephen, that was just life, it was a life changing move. And it just really helped me kind of get out of my shell and it helped put us on a path for really a better future. But so when you move to St.P, and by the way, if anyone out there has not visited St.P, it is just a lovely, even if it's just a day trip, because a lot of times, because I visit my sister in Tampa, which I'm there a lot, and I was telling Brittany earlier that, I mean, we didn't really talk about St.P, but because my mom, my parents, they're in clear water, which is also kind of a comparable type of area, although very different, but cool as well in a different way. And St.P, I always, I love the Dolly Museum. I love, I mean, just everything about St.P is just, it just feels kind of fancy and trendy and fun and cool and easy to fall in love with. So it is easy to fall in love with. And every time I leave it, even though it's only like a 30 minute drive back to my sister's 40 minutes, I'm like, oh, I love this place. There's more going on, I think, in St.P. than Clearwater, and that's not a dig at Clearwater at all. I love Clearwater. It's just a different, Clearwater is more of a beachy vibe, and St.P. it's a little bit more like of an upscale kind of fun, but it's also a very difficult place to become a rilter, because it's such an exclusive area, obviously prices are high, competition is high. There's just lots going on there. So I am really curious how you got started in St.P. because that's not an easy place to get started. No, and I was, like I said, I had some mindset issues that I was dealing with, so that was a struggle as well. So I decided to not start selling right away when we moved. And it was a hard decision, because I loved real estate, but it was ultimately the right one, because I needed to kind of get myself settled. So I actually was the office administrator for my office that I'm at at Premiere Set the Bees International Realty. So it was cool because I got to immerse myself in the market, learn, and I had like a steady paycheck, and then I could learn the company, and how amazing, when an amazing company is, and all the resources that we have, and it gave me time to build that sense of community. So that was in 2017, is when I got back into sales full time, and I did the ground running at that point. Yeah, because you, you know, that is, that's the first time in all of the people I've interviewed that I believe someone has gone that particular path. And as I'm hearing it now, it makes perfect sense, and I'm sort of shocked that I don't hear more people having done that. You know, basically the way I think about it is, it was almost, I mean, yes, you were paid, and you were paid to do that role. But I imagine it was just a learning experience. You had to absorb so much, probably great best practices, and maybe things not worth doing, and really just watching other, you're basically, or just in, if you were at an office where people came in, and the agents worked there, then boy, I can't even imagine what an education that was. Yeah, it was tremendous, and also just kudos to my company for letting me make that transition. You know, I went from office minister back into sales. So, you know, sometimes that can be a little sticky, because we are in a competitive environment, especially in Florida, you know. Yeah. But yeah, it was, it was the way I needed to do it, and I'm not gonna lie, say it was easy, because it was tough. I hurt my pride a little bit to not be selling, but it was definitely the right way for me. When you finally got into production, and that, so you had been in St. Pete for several years at that point, correct? Yes, to that, yeah. So 2015, so it was two, it was about a year and a half, basically, from when we moved to when I got back into sales. So, yeah. And so at that point still, and again, I don't know your sort of social life and how active you are getting out and meeting people, but essentially I'm assuming you didn't have a sphere of influence when you moved there, or at least how many small ones. Right, not in the zero. And then having to build that in, and it's interesting, because I am met, and I don't know that much about St. Pete, like the residents of St. Pete, I don't know how many are born and raised, live their whole lives there, but I bet it's a lot of people who move there at some point in their life, and it isn't a lot of born and raised, and sort of, I'm there my whole entire existence. So it's gotta be tough to really sort of establish oneself, because there's so much, so many people coming in and leaving, that you have all these other agents that are also trying to make those relationships with these new residents, or people who are newer to the area are thinking of moving there. How did you go about finding clients when you got into production? Yeah, I'm a very social person, so my husband, I joked that just about all the friends that we have here is because I made them first, so I was not afraid to get out there and meet people, and I think that's something that people forget, is it's kind of hard to make friends as an adult. Totally hard, yes. You have to put yourself out there and be vulnerable to be able to connect with new people. It's almost like dating, it's kind of a weird... It is very much that way, yes. So it's like I had to take the initiative to constantly meet people, and then when I met people like, hey, which like to hang out, it takes that, until you get into rhythm with people, where they start contacting you. So it was me just being really persistent, because I wanted to build community, because that's how I thrive. So again, it was just me being consistent and pursuing relationships, and over time it just got easier and easier, and we've lived here for eight years now, and we just love it, and we have the best friends, so. I was meeting with a newly licensed agent last night, or 4.30 yesterday, and she was asking me, she was interviewing our firm, and she's like, if you were me, and she was new to Chicago, she's like, I mean, she's been here for a year, but she's like, I don't really know hardly anyone. And I said, she goes, what would, if you were me, what would you do? And I said, you know, it's not easy. That's a tough position for anybody to be in, and I said, really if it was me, I would figure out every day how to meet like two or three new people and add them to my database. And that's actually a pretty difficult thing to do. It sounds like pretty simple, but I said, if I go your biggest problem is, you know, you don't have a large sphere, but you can remedy that. It just is gonna take a year or two, and you're going to have to meet people. That'll be like part of your day every day is, yes, you have to learn the real estate business and develop those skills and all of the normal being a good REALTOR stuff, but you really need to get out there and meet as many people as you can, get their information, and then figure out a way that you can stay in contact with them and provide value to them, and so that whenever they eventually are ready, but it was this adding people to your database. I'm like, it's kind of like, I call it the pushups of real estate when you're new. Like nobody really wants to do pushups, but it's a good idea if you want to build strength, and you can do it anywhere. That's kind of how I think about like building your business when you first start. Just meet as many people as you can, get their information, and then start to figure out how to stay in communication and community with them. And that actually leads me to this other thing I want to mention or talk about, which I think really fits into community is the podcast that you do. Tell us why you started doing it and how it's sort of gone for you. Yeah, so I, well, I will say kind of the initial thought came from Palm Ferry, which I know a lot of us agents listen to Palm Ferry, so he's always been so big on being video first and being like what he would call a digital mayor of your community. And I got inspired by that. It's like, oh, that'd be so fun. Like I love small business. I love shopping local. Maybe I can be the digital mayor of St.P. And then I was like, oh gosh, I don't know how, like I wasn't doing video consistently at that time. So I was like, I don't know how to do this. And this was probably in about 2019, I would say. I was really mulling this over. I was like, I don't know how to have videos and like go into a shop and I was thinking like news anchor, you know, it was just kind of that's what I was coming to mine. So I tabled it because I felt like a stuck. I don't know what to do with this. And I then started thinking about podcasts. And I was like, oh, wait a second. A podcast is way easier to start because it's just audio. I don't have to worry about the video. I can just get a business owner on the other side of the mic and ask them questions. And it's actually inexpensive to start up too with like the hosting platforms. So then I was like, okay, cool. I'll work on that. Well, I didn't get into it right away. It was like an idea I had that kind of set there for a couple more months. And I started 2020 and I was, I've been working with a business coach since the fall of 2019. So when we started 2020 and I was sharing these goals, he was like, okay, what do we got to do for you? You got to get this started. Like you've been holding on to this for too long. So I'm slowly but surely kind of putting these thoughts together to make the plan a launch podcast and then COVID happened. So I was like, oh, in our whole world's changed. So then I thought this is definitely a time that people need to be reminded about some whole business. Yeah, by local. Yeah. It's, I think it motivated me to, okay, we got to do launches podcasts. Like this is needed if we're doing this. So it's kind of how how it was born. So and I love it. And so I love this idea because you interview local artisans, local retailers, you know, just local people in the community who are important to St. Pete and the surrounding areas. And I love this because just the marketing, the marketer part of me just thinks this is such a brilliant strategy because what you're doing is what, what a lot of these like shop owners are constantly receiving this communication from ad agencies, people who want to sell them advertising. People that want to say, hey, we'd like to put you on a billboard or radio ad or whatever. And that's going to obviously cost money. Whereas you're basically contacting these retailers saying, I really love your store. I like what you do. I would love to just have a chat with you on my show and kind of introduce you to my audience. And you're basically giving them free marketing and free advertising. And also, so obviously that's a super generous thing to do. And it's part of you supporting your local community. Also, you're probably very rarely going to get a, nah, I'm not interested because there's no real downside, right? And then also when you are sharing these podcasts, you're, I'm sure you're tagging in the businesses or the business owners like, hey, by the way, if you want to promote this to your followers or your shoppers, it's really a brilliant strategy all the way around. I'm curious, not that you're doing it to get business, you're doing it to really support these local merchants and their services, which I think is ultra noble. And I love that. I'm just curious, has it also resulted in people knowing you more in the community and has that actually resulted in business? Yeah, so it's kind of, I think there's like a two-fold answer to that because number one, it plays back into the overall brand strategy. I've been working very hard at trying to build an online presence and build my personal brand. So it rolls back into that in a really nice way. I'll get referrals from agents across the country and only because they found me online and saw my online presence. Oh, that's interesting. So there's that piece to it. But then from like a very literal sense, the relationships that I'm making from the people I have on my podcast, whether it's something that happened right away, because like I said, this is my fourth year. So that whenever you're building relationships, it takes time to build that trust, no like a trust factor. And so this past year in 2022, I will say I had two transactions that I can directly link back from a guest that I had on my podcast. So like a very direct, like you know, this is the lead source that generated. Yeah. Hey, listen to your show. I'm reaching out to you that kind of thing. Yeah. Yeah, like actually this were two guests that I had on my podcast. So then the indirect part of it from, you know, people that have reached out to me that have been listening to the podcast, you know, more just more relationships. I mean, the more conversations you have, the better chance you have for, you know, bringing in those transactions. So yeah. We're any other REALTORS having a similar type of show, another podcast that you were competing, a nothing, I don't always think podcasts compete with each other, but were you kind of the first person to do that in the St. Pete area? That's a real estate agent. I think so. I mean, I researched it to a degree and I really didn't see anything like that online. So I believe so. I mean, there's definitely some other agents that do really good video content in our area. But from the podcast perspective, I'm, I guess I was a pioneer in that. I don't know. I mean, it's really funny because so my sister lives in Tampa in a neighborhood or I don't know if it's a neighborhood, but in area called Palmasy, I'm sure you're familiar. And I was thinking about this, like, well, there's probably Tampa agents that already have Tampa podcasts, and I'm sure that's true. It's a much bigger area. But is there a Palmasy podcast? I don't know, probably not. And it's like, that would be, you could even just be a Palmasy podcast host if someone's listening. And I guarantee my sister who lives there would listen because she's like, I want to know what's going on in Palmasy. So you can get hyper specific. It doesn't have to have, you know, tens of thousands of followers on every episode if you're still meeting the needs of whatever the community is. And I think it's brilliant that you did that. I just love that. Well, and I'll tell you, this literally just happened to me. So a couple months ago, we were at a event and I had someone come up to me and she was like, you don't know me, but I'm so and so and I've been following your podcast for a couple of years. And I just love, you know, it was just like, she was so excited to meet me and I was like, oh, okay, wow. So what was such a cool moment to have like a fan in a sense? Yeah. And anyway, so she's a lender and she had recently moved to St. Pete. So that was kind of her like connection. And you know, we were able to continue talking and we recently got together for coffee and just to hear her say, we, me and my husband listened to your podcast and we have a date, like a date day once a week that we always try to pick places that you have in your podcast and go to. So like, my podcast is helping them find like a new spot to go. Yeah. So just stuff like that. I'm like, oh my God, that's so freaking cool. It is. It's like even if it never resulted in actual business, it's just a good feeling of like, I am providing for the community. I'm supporting the community. I'm doing it because I love, live and I love, you know, I love and I live in this community. So whether or not it ever actually translates into business, you know, it's a grind, of course, doing podcasts are not easy, but it's just hearing one person say, you know, I like your show. I listen to that is really, really heartwarming. And so I always say it's kind of one of those things that even if it doesn't generate like this huge spike in production for someone, boy, you'll get a lot of just good feelings knowing that you're helping the community. Yeah. And you gotta do stuff that fills you up, you know, because if you don't fill ourselves up, we're not gonna be able to be the best for our clients. could not agree with you more. Okay, I want to talk, let's talk mindset. And there's something very specific about mindset that come, we talk about mindset a lot on the show and a lot of our guests, you know, reference it. And I almost don't like the word anymore because I feel like it's just one of those words that gets used very, very often without any real clear awareness of like, what does that actually mean? But I, you have a particularly like interesting story about how you're mind, how you identified a mindset issue through your coaching, I'm guessing through Tom Ferry coaching. But I tell us a little bit about what was the mindset that was stopping you? And then how did you identify it? How'd you first become aware of it? Where you were like, oh, I'm doing this thing to myself and then how did you overcome it? Yeah, I kind of fell into coaching. It was, which I, you know, I don't believe in quinsances. So I feel like God was like, here, here's your answer. So I have, I've had a history of anxiety. And so when we moved here, that was a life trigger and I was having a real school. That's tough for people with anxiety moving to a new city where they know nobody. That is a brutal one. And for the first time, I mean, you know, like I said, never lived anywhere else because I went to school in Mobile. So yeah, so I started, you know, well, I went to therapy to help myself, you know, as I make the transition, which highly recommend therapy. But getting back into real estate, you know, as I said, I started selling again in 2017 and I was just kind of struggling with, I couldn't get any momentum. Like I just couldn't get that traction and get over the hump of, like I know I can be a top producing agent. Like I see it. I see that version of myself, but I can't figure out how to get there. And I met a local coach through our chamber because I'm really involved with the St. Pete Chamber and I met him just by happenstance and he started probing and asking questions. And he made an offer. He was like, I feel like you could really benefit from coaching. Would you be interested in we, and that's how we got started. And he helped me figure out that I was my own obstacle. Like it was all coming back to me. It was limiting, limiting beliefs that I had for myself. I couldn't let go of that story of, well, I haven't had much success before. So that's just going to be what it is. It's just those things that you get on repeat in your mind. I had a fixed mindset. I didn't have a question. Yeah, sort of hobbles somebody when they're, it's like I've always heard like whatever container you think your life fits in is you'll fill up that container but you won't go beyond it. And so same sort of thing with like, however long a task takes whatever amount of time you set for it, you'll eventually just go to that whatever amount of time. So this idea of not even acknowledging or understanding that there's this sort of box that's limiting because there's anxiety, there's fear, there's real feelings that are coming up that are based in reality. It's not like some people have anxiety that's not based in reality but yours obviously is based in reality. So there's a lot of reason to take that anxiety on because you're like, no, this is a real thing that's happening. How did you, how did you start to move past that? You know, it's just, it's really tough work. It takes a lot of time to reprogram your brain. And you know, like with anything, you have to be consistent. And I think some people kind of, they're like, okay, cool, I'm going to meditate and do some affirmations but then they don't stick with it. It's like you're never going to see the results. If you don't do it consistently. So through my coach and also I've been to ninja selling. So I've done the ninja selling installation, which mine sets a really big part of what they teach. So learning some of those practices I would say from a daily basis really helped me. So that morning routine of writing and reading affirmation, positive affirmations, meditation, you know, it's really just, it sounds so, it sounds so simple, but it's not, but it's like the basic steps that if you keep doing them over and over again, you will reprogram your brain. Because that's how our brains work. You know, our non-conscious brain can't take a joke. So it's going to, whatever you feed it, it's going to feed back to you. So if you keep feeding it positive stuff eventually, it starts to, you know, reprogram. So agreed. And there's most of our programming comes from mom and dad when we were little and a lot of it is just not helpful anymore. But it's so deeply ingrained. And I think that's where good therapy can kind of say, okay, I see that you were running this old pattern that doesn't really make sense anymore based on your family history. This makes perfect sense to a therapist, but to an individual they might go, God, how do I keep sabotaging or why am I keeping, why do I think I'm worthless or why do I think I can't make it? Well, that's because somehow you pick that up as a child from something or somewhere or whatever. And it just is unresolved and it manifests in things like anxiety and in certain types of behavior. I didn't know I was in anxious. I mean, this is so funny because everyone in my life knows me as an anxious person. I didn't know that I've been in therapy for a million years. I just in the last two or three years have identified, oh my gosh, I'm a really an anxious person. And I've had to learn how to self-soothe and how to cope with anxiety and ride it out. And know that it feels real. And it's a real thing that's happening to me, but it doesn't mean that it's actually happening in real life coming in. So anyway, the point is, is that journey is a really important journey, I think, to go on because most people probably aren't that aware of their limiting mindsets or their limiting beliefs or some of these things. And boy, if you can get out of your own way, life just gets a lot easier. Yeah, I always think about that quote, Jim Rohn quote, about your level of success rarely exceeds your level of personal development, something like that. I'm not saying that correctly, but that's kind of what I realized was by spending time on myself, then I was, like I said, reprogramming and it's just, it's that domino effect, that snowball, it just starts to, over time, work its way through and it becomes like this repeatable, consistent thing. And it's almost like working a muscle, you know, to get that muscle memory and you get, it just becomes more natural to, instead of staying in the negative, you automatically flip to the positive. So it just takes that repetition over and over and over again. Yeah, it takes a tremendous dedication and a commitment and a lot of you, like you said, I consider it harder than digging ditches, but it really is. I mean, it takes a, and it's exhausting to do. That being said, it's really the most important work anybody can do, you know, take care of your, you take care of your, not you, I'm saying in general, we think we wanna take care of our physical health, I'm sure you do that as well. But, you know, we don't always think, well, I'm going to the gym three times a week, what am I doing for my mind? What am I actually doing to sort of explore and, and, you know, look, nobody's mom and dad were perfect. So there are lots of wounds that every single person on this planet has, and you can start to identify and go into and there's, you know, all sorts of professionals that can help you sort of navigate those waters. But I'm glad you're talking about it. I think that's really, really important. And I, every single person in our podcast deals with some sort of level of anxiety, especially when they're new to the business or they're meeting, you know, maybe they've never done a million dollar sale and they have their first listing presentation with, you know, somebody that seems like it's, oh, I don't think they're gonna choose me. There's a lot of that, that is totally normal, totally okay. And there's solutions that help through that. And then once you get through it and you realize, oh, that didn't swallow me up, it didn't kill me. Oh, I might actually be able to tolerate some of these challenges. I would love to talk about, so you talked about the morning and I know that REALTORS, there's a book, Miracle Morning, that like every REALTOR loves, yes, there's a lot. Well, how ill rods book, I've yet to meet anyone who was like, yeah, that just doesn't work. So I'm going to assume on the 90,000 people that have told me about this book and I've read it as well, that it is a really good idea. Can you talk a little bit about how you structure your mornings? You talked about meditation, journaling, things like that. Are you still doing those things? Yeah, so with Ninja selling installation, it taught me a lot about starting the day with gratitude. So gratitude and affirmation was kind of my first way into having a morning routine. And I saw immediate results with that. Because again, you're getting yourself out of a negative state by waking up watching the news or being on social media, but staying in a positive state. And then I would say in the past year, I learned about how ill rod in the Miracle Morning, and that took into a whole other level for me. So I've been doing the Miracle Morning for several months. And like there's an app, so it's easy to stay on top of. And just combining like a commitment to the gratitude and affirmation, which was already important to me, but the silence, which having like a daily devotional reading my Bible, praying, that's another really big aspect for me, and the reading a book, which is usually a personal, something personal development wise and exercise. So it's like putting all that stuff together was definitely took that to another level for me. So. Yeah, I think we're talking about process, right? So we have now a process that you can follow each morning. It's not wake up and what do I feel like doing as much as before I start my day, I have these things that really help ground me, center me, and look, people's, look, all of our lives are chaotic, right? We have things going on in our personal lives. We have things bouncing around in our heads, with spouses, children, other financial situations, all sorts of conflict and challenge. And those are things that just, that's just what happens. That's just part of life. And those things can bounce around in my head, at least, and I can wake up. And if I'm not intentional about what I'm focused, gonna focus on today, those anxieties about all of those things that are uncomfortable or scary to me, really take the forefront and jump in front, and kind of run the show and color the way that I approach the rest of the day. So having this process in the morning that says, it's not that I'm avoiding those things, I'm gonna take care of those things. I'm gonna, you know, I'm not, I'm not being polyanna, but I'm also, by the way, even though I don't feel like doing it right now, I'm gonna journal, or I'm gonna meditate, or I'm going to pray, or read, or whatever it might be to help sort of, you realize, you know, life has all sorts of ups and downs, and you can structure some self-care in that morning, and then you can tackle the anxiety and stuff later. So I just think that is such a brilliant strategy. So I applaud you for, I need to start doing the miracle morning. I need to start doing it. It's wonderful. And it helped me get up earlier, because that was, I struggled with that, just like, I don't have kids, so I didn't, you know, I didn't have that motivator to get up earlier with kids. Sure. I would find myself, you know, sleeping in too long, just to not like sleeping in really late, but just to where, you feel like you're starting the day behind, you know? And so that was, you know, getting up earlier than I had been, you know, like 645, which I know some people get up way earlier than that, but for me, 645 was like, all right, this is a milestone. I'm doing this. I can do this. So that's been great, because it's just giving me time back. You know, I'm getting my day set up, like you're saying, being intentional, and I think it just helped, I think when you get your day started like that, it just helps the whole rest of the day go way better and be able to tackle, it comes your way. I could not agree more. I told my girlfriend if she ever sees me, or hears me, and she hears me do this a lot, go into like a negative rant where I'm like, really fired up about something, if I'm going on too long, like it's one thing to have an expression of anger or whatever, or be upset about something that's perfectly okay. I'm not here to tell people they can't have negative feelings, because of course, you should have negative feelings. They're really important. But if you've, if I said to my girlfriend, sometimes I get swallowed up a little bit in them, and I don't realize that I'm really like, okay, I've been going on for 15 minutes about something that's like just not that important. So I said, if you catch me doing that, can you just put your finger up in the air, and that'll be my cue to stop what I'm saying, and immediately say, as bad as things seem right now, I got to list three things that are going really well in my life, you know, and it doesn't mean the other thing that's not going well is gone. It just means I'm trying to balance it and realize, it's not all bad, and it's not all good. It's kind of in the middle, and I can acknowledge both things, but I have to get out of that repetition, because I grew up in a, my family, lovely, amazing people, but they were more critical than I would have preferred. So I'm just kind of used to being super critical. So I have to have these little interruptions that go, hey, okay, yeah, you should be critical in a minute, but for now, let's at least think about some things that are actually going really well. So those are your giving power to, I mean. You're right. You're giving power to that negative negativity, and then it just becomes this monster that like takes over. It can, yeah, and it's really awesome to be able to acknowledge something without giving it power. Like you're like, no, I know you're still there, and I know that's still a problem, and I know we'll figure out a solution, but it's not gonna swallow me up, it's not gonna take over my day, and it's not gonna ruin my day. I'm gonna try to, you know, try to persevere in the face of any sort of obstacle, and that's where a good coach can come in, right? Like a therapist, a coach, somebody who can say, hey, I noticed you're not doing this thing, that would be really helpful for you. What's going on? What's stopping you? Well, I don't wanna do it. Okay, and then you can start from there, you know, and kind of identify what's been missing. So I love all of this. I think this is so well said, a quick, so I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about 2023, because I have a little bugaboo in the industry, because anyone who's paying attention, not every market is this way, but most markets in the country, I just wanna be really honest about it. I think this is gonna be a tough year for REALTORS. It just is, rates are high, inventory's low. It's just, you know, for a lot of us, it's going to be a more difficult year than it was a year and a half ago. I think most of us would agree, that's a reasonable statement. Doesn't mean it can't be a great year. It's just gonna be a tough year, at least I think so. I am curious, what are you doing this year to stay on top of it, to stay active, to, you know, the markets shifted and changed? What are you doing to sort of stay on top of things so that you're not like, again, just taking in all this, oh, it's gonna be a brutal year and then sort of letting that not let you, you know, sort of take action. Yeah, I mean, I think one of the biggest things that I've learned in the last couple of years is what am I in control of versus what am I not in control of? And we're always in control of... Prayer of Saint Francis, speaking back to prayers. Yeah, so we're always in control of our thoughts and our actions. And what I fall back to whenever I start to feel some of that negativity like when we hear, okay, hey, it's gonna be a tougher year. You're gonna need to double down and do more to get kind of the same results is just getting in action. All right, I'm gonna get super focused on what I need to be doing and I'm gonna double down on, which for me, I'm just focused on having more conversations. I love it. That's kind of my, you know, that's my focus for this year and I always break things down into like months and quarters. So, because again, wanna be like super intentional and focused and I don't wanna have like this overarching goal for the year and then not know what to do. I wanna like strategize and make that actionable. So, you know, just having more conversations, getting in front of people and I think that also goes back to that brand strategy. You know, I think some people when they hear negative news about the market, they just kind of stick their head in the sand and then they stop doing things and I choose to have an abundant mindset. I mean, so I'm gonna keep moving forward and I'm gonna keep, you know, pursuing my marketing channels. I'm gonna have my podcast, I'm gonna make videos. Videos is a big part of that strategy for me this year. So, I'm gonna keep putting myself out there and there's always a market and every market, there's a market, you know, like there's always people that are out there that have to buy and sell. It's life, people move. You know, you gotta live somewhere. Relocation, people move, you know, obviously marriages and unfortunately, negative things like divorce and people that pass away. So, you know, it just can't stick your head in the sand, you gotta get out there and take action and it's that snowball effect. When she gets that momentum, when she get going, it starts to, you know, roll faster and faster. And yeah, and I'll give everyone who's listening a couple of predictions that I pretty sure are gonna come true, that will make you feel a little better about this year. Number one, lots of agents will leave the industry. I know this because we own a holding company which is for agents who are leaving the industry and we had within the last year, we've added 250 new agents to the whole, I mean, it used to have 500 agents in it and now it has almost 800 agents. And that's just been within the last year and as much as that pains me to see people leaving the industry for people that are committed and still working in the business and on the business, it's actually a really good thing for everyone who stays in because you can pick up some market share, of course, lots of people will not have REALTORS that are still in the business that they, you know, there's a lot of people that will just be up for grabs and so if you can double down, especially, and I love that you broke it down into the most sort of basic activity for you which is probably the most important activity for all REALTORS, I would imagine, is having conversations. So do you have like a certain goal you talked about having, you know, a certain amount per quarter or per month, do you also have like a per day goals? Like I really wanna have X number of conversations per day. Yeah, I kinda have it by week and really, I've always had that in the back of my head but this year I was like, I'm gonna track this. Like I have whiteboards in my office and so I put up on the whiteboard, like, you know, these are the number of fire and fire and seller, like, you know, fire consultation, seller listing consultation appointments that I wanna have for this year and then these are the amount of conversations that I wanna have per week. So I'm like, just, you know, checking those off on the board and for each week. So I, you know, what gets measured gets managed. So it's like just having that in front of me in a really visual way, I think it's gonna help because I just, like I said, it's kind of known that's there and that's in metric but I'm gonna really track it. So that's what I'm doing. I wanna dive just a little deeper into your conversations because I know whenever we, whenever we've had a guests on the show and they talk about conversations, I've always failed to ask this question. When you say conversation, what specifically are, what defines a conversation in your mind since you are measuring it? Yeah, I mean, to me, it's just a meaningful conversation. So whether that's me calling a client, a past client and I leave a voicemail because it's an answer, it still counts because I'm still touching them. I mean, it's just having a meaningful conversation. So that, or if I go to a networking event, I'm getting like 10 conversations at one time, you know, for the whole evening. And so I'm sorry to jump in. Does it have to be a real estate conversation or could it be anything related to just life in general? Just having, you know, talking to someone like you care, and they're a real person, you know, hey, what's going on with you? Do you have any vacation plans this year? Oh, okay, your daughter's graduating, like just diving into life with people because that's how you build that rapport. I mean, in real estate always comes up at some point because people love to talk about real estate. So you don't have to worry about bringing up or a real estate. So just being a human, I think that's what it comes down to. But isn't that the best news of all that that is all you have to do is show interest in someone, demonstrate that you care about them. And you should obviously, you should only do it authentically. If you do it in authentically, it's not going to work. But it doesn't have to be, it doesn't have to be this pressure of like, oh, I know everything about the St. Peter'sburg real estate market. And I know every fact and figure, you know, maybe you do. But, you know, most agents don't feel that way about their, you know, the area they work and maybe they are like, oh, if I talk about it, I might not have an answer for you. You don't have to talk about real estate, right? Like you should know enough to be able to have a conversation that's to keep that going. But you can also, you know, I always love social media, I think is particularly good for this because if you see somebody who's gone on vacation, you know, instead of just being the REALTOR, that's like, I just listed this home and I just sold this home and look at how cool I am. I personally, that's, that's, that doesn't speak to me. That sort of advertising, and I'm not putting people down, I'm sort of sounded like I was putting agents down who do that. And I really, I, that is not what my intention is. And I think you should absolutely brag about your accomplishments. I think that's an okay thing. But I like the idea of social media to go the other way where you could be like, oh, I saw you just went on this vacation, tell me about it. Yep. And people love that because then they, of course, you care, you actually paid attention. I mean, you know, people always want like, if you want to talk about themselves, you know, they want to know that you're interested. I mean, that's how we work. So just showing interest in people and to your point of saying like, do it authentically. I mean, that's a huge part of it. And it just, it goes back to building a brand. It's like, just be yourself. Like you, you gotta be yourself. You can't be afraid to be yourself because if you put yourself out there authentically, you're gonna, your vibe attract your tribe. You're gonna get people back that are like minded like you. So I agreed. And you're right. There's enough business for everybody, even if agents aren't exiting the industry this year, which they will be. But even if everyone was flooding into the market this year, and it was gonna be twice as many agents, you know, people could still have incredibly successful years. But I think this is the year of action. I think action will overcome some of these, you know, again, to quote the prayer of St. Francis, like things we can't control market conditions, et cetera. Those are things outside of our control. But what we can control is our effort and our action. And all we really ever have to do is real estate agents is get people to no like and trust us. That's not an easy thing to do, but that is your goal. If you can, if people no like and trust you, they will choose you as their agent. Or they're going to choose somebody they no like and trust. And you want to be on that short list. So I think this is just amazing. And so for everyone who's listening, I want you to check out Britney's podcast. And if you're like, well, I don't live in St. Pete. I don't really care about the restaurants in St. Pete. That's not the reason I want you to check it out. I want you to check it out to see what she's doing and how she's affecting her community and why that might be something that you may want to consider for your local community. It is a brilliant strategy. This, my podcast was based out of a very similar principle, which is I just want to provide value to other agents by talking to top agents like Britney. That was five years ago. I was unsure if anyone would listen. And here we are now all these episodes later. And thankfully we have incredible listeners and people who are really, really appreciative of what we do. And that's not to put a feather in my cap. But what I will tell you is it has helped me in my business of recruiting agents. I don't use this to recruit agents, but obviously we have almost 800 agents that are company here. And a lot of them come over because they listen to our show. So yes, you will likely see a benefit to your business down the road. But boy, you're going to help the community along the way. So check out Britney's podcast. Also, a lot of people retire to Florida. Why? Because state taxes are really, really impressive. A lot of people move to Florida at some point in their lives. I'm in Illinois. So we have a lot of people who spend there, like my parents, they spend basically their winters there now. And we'll probably eventually move down there for those tax benefits as well. So a lot of people move to Florida. And you probably know people in your sphere that are also moving. And you can connect with Britney because you can say, not only do I have a great REALTOR in C&B, she actually hosts like this great podcast where she's like super connected to the whole community. She knows all the best areas, the best places to go and visit. And she would be a great resource. So this could be a great referral source for you. So if you have clients that are considering making that transition, Britney, what's the best way an agent should reach out to you? I would say shoot me an email if you're an agent. That I'll see it faster. So that's Britney.renew at premiercer.com. So that's premiercer. SIR short for SETTABEE's International Realty. So yeah, shoot me an email, follow me on Instagram, send me a DM. Yeah, any way I would love to connect. Yeah, and I just think I always love this idea of when you make a referral, you really want to know that the other person's going to take great care of the client. And with the fact that you're so integrated with the St. Pete community with different boards and just also with your podcast, I would be very comfortable without ever knowing how you've treated a client. I would be comfortable sending a client to you because I'm like, oh, she's really dialed in. She knows stuff and she's an important person in that community, whether Britney, whether you think you are or not. You know, I know that you are. So guys, this is how you can build, you can build this exact same brand for yourself in your local community. And you can use things like podcasts, video. It doesn't have to be a podcast. You could do just video stuff on Facebook. But whatever you want to do, be of service to your community. And you will find that over time, people really, really appreciate it. And more business. So if you have somebody that's looking to move to Florida, Southern Tampa, St. Pete, or Clearwater, rather, anywhere around that area, definitely reach out to Britney. And if she can't help, she'll know who to send you to. But she would be the first place that I would go. So everybody, visit her website. You can find all things Britney at BritneyRenew.com. Again, that's B-R-I-T-T-A-N-Y-R-A-N-E-W. I'll have a link to that in the show notes. Also link to her Instagram and social, which is Britney Renew REALTOR. And yeah, guys, check out what she's doing. You can do this too. So Britney, on behalf of our audience, I want to thank you for your time. You were an amazing guest. I had a lot of fun with you. And really grateful that you came on.
