[00:01:17] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team? Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:29] But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now.
[00:01:45] And which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you now. I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration. This is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:58] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer.
[00:02:14] So now when I'm recruiting corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:23] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now onto the show.
[00:02:55] Hello and welcome to another episode of keeping it real the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide. I am your host through the show. And in just a moment we're going to be speaking with top producer Jarrett Jarvis before we get to Jarrett.
[00:03:11] Just a quick reminder. First of all, if you are new to the podcast, welcome. We appreciate you being here. If you are returning, we appreciate you as well. Also I have started a new video series a short form video series.
[00:03:27] Two to three episodes a week 60 seconds long. This is called the AI agent men every other day or so. I create an AI prompt that you can drop into chat.
[00:03:41] I'm going to get to the next level with your business. These are prompts that top 1% agents have told me they use or prompts I am using myself. So where you can get these not here unfortunately, but on all the different social channels we are on find keeping it real. Hit that subscribe button and let me know what you think of the AI agent minute my conversation with Jarrett Jarvis.
[00:04:20] I was the best piece of advice you've received real estate.
[00:04:25] The best piece of advice that I've received is stop trying to do everything yourself. So once I started delegating away and really structuring my business with processes and people.
[00:04:38] My business just grew and stress went down. So that's probably the best word advice that I've received worst piece of advice.
[00:04:46] Just work harder. So in real estate, you can always find more to do. Right. And I think we're all very competitive. We talked about this together earlier on the call.
[00:04:56] And I think systems and people beat hustle right. So it goes back to the people delegation getting the right people in place will really let you scale and you don't have to work hard. You just got to really work smarter.
[00:05:08] Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense because you're right. We can always be busy and that can feel productive.
[00:05:16] And then if we were flecked on what we've done over that time period, it's not always productive.
[00:05:21] And I know I fall into that trap. So I appreciate that advice by guest today is Jarrett Jarvis from second city agents with Compass.
[00:05:29] He is in Chicago. Let me tell you more about Jarrett. Jarrett is a licensed real estate agent with Compass realty who is sold over 200 homes and has been featured on HD TV, bar still sports and also featured in real producers magazine.
[00:05:42] He is also the founder and CEO of cura, a virtual assistant company that helps real estate agents streamline operations, scale their businesses and focus on serving clients before transitioning into real estate.
[00:05:54] Jarrett worked with Fortune 500 companies as a channel marketing specialist collaborating with remodellers builders and architects, a marketing graduate from Illinois State University.
[00:06:04] He is known for a strong work ethic creative strategy and deep commitment to his clients born and raised in Chicago.
[00:06:10] He now lives in Irving Park with his wife Elise, their daughter Sienna, their dog Wyatt and also manages 20 rental units as an active investor.
[00:06:19] So he's doing a lot. I want you to follow Jarrett at his Instagram on his Instagram, which is homes of Chicago and check out his virtual assistant company.
[00:06:31] We're going to be talking about that today that is work with cura, see you are a work with cura.com will have links to both of those in the show notes. Jarrett, welcome.
[00:06:40] Thanks for the intro DJ. That was great.
[00:06:42] I appreciate it.
[00:06:46] It's always fun for me to get to know, you know, especially people here locally in Chicago do as many Chicago interviews anymore.
[00:06:54] I started only doing Chicago interviews because that was the only people I had the confidence to even ask, you know, would you come on my show?
[00:06:59] Yeah.
[00:07:00] Now I don't get to do as many.
[00:07:02] So I appreciate that. You and I have some mutual friends and I really admire your team, your team at Compass.
[00:07:09] I know many of those agents and they're all just great agents and excited to have you have you here.
[00:07:15] So I want to talk a little bit. I love that you have a marketing background. That's my background as well.
[00:07:21] And I want to sort of dive into that first and just kind of understand how you think about marketing because that is something that you probably bring up a particular skill set or a lot of agents, you know, struggle on the marketing side.
[00:07:36] So tell us a little bit about, you know, how you market your business.
[00:07:40] Sure. I think that brand is everything, right?
[00:07:43] I think as you stated earlier, it's homes of Chicago. And right when I started from the beginning, I wanted to be the go to Chicago agent for real estate agents nationwide.
[00:07:54] I didn't think about actual clients. I thought about how do I get out to a broader section of people.
[00:08:02] So it was a completely different mindset. So my marketing mindset is completely the opposite of what people are doing.
[00:08:07] So if you're going A, I'm going B, right? It's also guerrilla marketing tactics, right? Like doing different things on social media, like top 30 list, like one of our videos got 60,000 views.
[00:08:18] It was usually it's top 10, right? It's a top 10 list. Yeah.
[00:08:22] I said, let's do a top 10 of ramen noodle soup.
[00:08:24] Soup super random. Have I ate it all those places? Maybe maybe I haven't. You don't know that. But 60,000 people tuned into that video and we're requesting and debating about ramen noodle soup.
[00:08:38] By the way, I'm going to jump in for a second because this is such a brilliant video. I love ramen and there are there are, you know, maybe 100 ramen places here in the.
[00:08:48] Yeah, I go or close to it. There probably really is about 100 and I every time I always forget which is the best. I literally just can't remember because I have a terrible memory and I always go on to Google.
[00:09:01] Well, I would use chat, she'd be tea to help me, but I always go or YouTube and I would say or Reddit and I would say it's the very best ramen right now because new ones pop up all the time.
[00:09:11] Sure. And it's so funny that you made that video because that is such a brilliant video because I think me would have found that video. I might have found that video and it's just a great idea for marketing because yeah, 60,000 people.
[00:09:26] I mean, the ramen is such a great example of that. Yeah, exactly. And I don't think it has to be all about like marketing. You really need to know who your target market is, right?
[00:09:36] And you really need to think outside the box like how can you help people with a problem, right? And for our clients, as you know, in real estate, they're looking for you to be the solution for it's not just the real estate transaction.
[00:09:50] It's everything in life from engagement rings to the best ramen places to, you know, a lot of my followers now are real estate is around the country because I'm on one of the top teams in Chicago.
[00:10:02] I'm using virtual assistants and now they're looking at me for how what is he using a virtual system for right like I have been posted on social media this year myself once it's my VAs right I'm behind the scenes creating the concept like looking at the content, proving the content and stamping it.
[00:10:19] But then it goes out and it's it's out to the world. So it's been pretty cool.
[00:10:22] Yeah, I love that I want to dive into this problem solving methodology because this is a marketing sort of paradigm shift that once somebody gets it specifically around solving problems related to what your clients are experiencing and may not be related to real estate, right? Like ramen.
[00:10:45] It might be dinner what I'm going to have for dinner or maybe it is real estate related tangentially like where's the best, you know, grocery store in this particular neighborhood or how close to my to the subway system here in Chicago we call the L or things like that where the best places to live for, you know, X Y or Z.
[00:11:05] I think those are absolutely how I know that's how I search on line and I'm always looking for answers to those questions I were going on a trip to the Northeast in next week and I specifically was looking at like where the best places to visit in May new Hampshire and Vermont and those are searches I do and those are video searches I do.
[00:11:26] And you're right 60,000 people will find that and what I love about YouTube in particular that a lot of agents sort of neglect YouTube they focus more on Instagram and Facebook and TikTok and those are great but those are sort of flash in the pan digestible they go away they don't I mean they do technically live forever but they don't the algorithm doesn't really favor older content but YouTube does favor older content if it's good and that stuff just lives forever and you can continually get leads I'm sure you do.
[00:11:56] Yeah totally.
[00:11:57] From those kind of videos so you know when you start to think about problems that your clients have it must be pretty fun to do that because then you just think about content creation.
[00:12:08] Well I mean yeah I mean like one of the things I one of the problems we saw with with clients for example was we're moving in a new house we need a ton of new furniture yeah and if you've moved before DJ you know it's extremely expensive to buy furniture.
[00:12:20] How many agents out there have trade discounts or even know what trade discounts are like if you have an LLC and you're a real estate agent you can message every major top brand out there and you can get 20 to 40% off discount codes that you can provide your clients and so just having that sheet to send out to your clients when they move or posting on social media people are like hey like I didn't buy with you I bought with my other this other person like why didn't they give me a trade day discount can you give me the trade absolutely like I'll give you a
[00:12:51] tiny one right and it's that going back to help with this and how do you solve that's just an example that is a great example I've never heard of that so I love that so if you have an LLC or an S corporation you have a company for your real estate practice as Jared says reach out to the furniture manufacturers and see if they're gosh I didn't know that even DJ you could even reach out to create a barrel.
[00:13:18] We're all trading discount right 30% off like the container store our house all those webs all those different companies I'm thinking about so I'm looking to put my place on the market and I have to get it you know just things patched up and and you know scuffs marked out you know that kind of thing and I realized I have this one of my one of my I guess baseboards is got some water and it kind of expanded so I have to replace it and I'm like I don't know who does that I mean I can find somebody on tasker and I could just look it up but I'm
[00:13:48] I would much rather go to somebody like you probably knows who the best handyman are and or you know you would have that resource and I like I have a license I don't really use it but I don't know who to go to so those are things that people are going to everybody I always think like probably everybody owns a property could always use a handyman any given time while they're living there like there's always a project that isn't finished totally something to be fixed up so handyman stuff is super helpful.
[00:14:18] Oh yeah I mean you have to have that especially as our careers have progressed we're now getting more into the listings and we have to have a whole team come in and quickly get this house up to what the quality that we like to list right so I mean we have to pretty much handyman that are working around at Chicago and area and electrician plumber drywall or all that stuff so yeah.
[00:14:42] Yeah well let's talk about some trends that you've noticed and you know how are buyers and sellers changing these days I know you've mentioned there's been some shifts and curious to know sort of what you're witnessing.
[00:14:56] Well in the buyer side they are definitely hyper focused on the rate I would say because you know this generation saw the rates dropped in the 2s and 3s and they don't really understand the concept of why did that happen
[00:15:11] and why did it go back so quickly and now it's going down and for example like I have clients under contract right now they got a 6.75 interest rate from one mortgage broker and the other one just beat him by a half a point.
[00:15:27] Wow okay and they're like why is that happen and I'm like that's a great question right now did that mortgage broker not lock in the rates the rates went up today who knows but I think they're super hyper focused on that
[00:15:41] I also think that now with Chatchy BT and AI they can really really be just really really know a lot more about the home buying process at at their fingertips like you can take a photo of an AC unit in Chatchy BT post it and say what years this and the serial number instantly tells me how what's the life like expectancy and how long how long has been so I would say that and then on the selling side right it's they are expecting
[00:16:10] the house to really be marketed in a very I would say visually impactful way right like I had a client the other day was like hey should we virtually stage this like if we take we're going to remove all the all the furniture that's in there because it's a renter and we're going to virtually stage it and I said hey if you're scrolling through 80 80 places today okay and you see a property that's empty
[00:16:37] okay and then you see a property that has staged furniture virtually staged you may not even know if it's virtually stage because it's so good sure but you can envision your your dining room table being in that kitchen you can imagine your couch being in that living room that gets your minds thinking and slows you down just a little bit from not scrolling every second maybe every three seconds
[00:16:55] I think it's going to get attached to that house right so I think sellers are really expecting us to really step our games up from an artificial standpoint also like listing descriptions like you see these listing descriptions that are like 250 400 500 words yeah we're doing a thousand to 2000 wow SEO we're trying to get SEO we're trying to get as many views on those properties as possible so for listing descriptions are what's your thought process there for longer descriptions is it
[00:17:24] I want to tell a story is it you know kind of walk me through that a little bit we gather as much details about the mechanics and any updates they don't we do I mean I take photos of every single major mechanical product that when we go through the walkthrough right so I have that so they don't have to fill out the whole description of like because they don't know right the age of the washing machines sure we have all that details we then ask them if there's any favorite restaurants shopping or parks that they like an area thing
[00:17:54] that they like do with their kids or family and then we take all of that data and then we take you know more information about that property as well we put it into chat you be T or AI it spits out you know we put in the MLS rules because it has the MLS rules I'll say please audit this to the MLS rules and it provides this amazing content sometimes it will put like restaurants in there and you you know I do my do do just look it up and it's like this is we're not going to market a fast food restaurant that has five stars are like five five star reviews like there's no one going there
[00:18:24] but it gives a really good output and then you know you just let the SEO come in which is great so so that's one of the that's how we look at it from a character standpoint I love that you're you are all in on AI I am doing a lot with it myself and I'm I'm learning and we're doing videos just for anyone listening if you're not currently a subscriber to our social channels please do look us up keeping it real where everywhere on all the channels we do short form video there where I do an AI prompt two to three times a week for eight
[00:18:54] agents that they can use to help grow their business and one of the things and I know you do this with your AI prompts is really thinking about crafting the query is is really the most important way and so I do this with YouTube descriptions I suspect you might do the same where I upload a video I put just you know my version of a description in and then I have you to review the video or sorry I have chat GPT review the video and then say acting as an SEO specialist that understand
[00:19:24] the YouTube algorithm and here's who I'm looking to attract to this video here's what here's what I'm looking to with the YouTube algorithm to do for me please rewrite the description in a you know engaging way and you can really just get hyper specific about it now you know and it always comes up with something better than I could have done so totally no I mean and talking to it like that it takes a moment for people to write like I want this to be elegant yep
[00:19:49] 1000 characters I want you to include restaurants I want you to include local parks schools like you have to talk to it in a certain way and then you have to give it more details at the end of massage it so it's not perfect but like it gets better and better the more you talk to it which at like the pro version at least so I love that you're using AI you also are really big with virtual assistance I am as well I'm all an un virtual assistance they make my life so much better and I'm so grateful that we live in a world
[00:20:18] where I can have people that you know from all over the world who are willing to you know work with me they're effective they're efficient they're super knowledgeable and let's talk a little bit about it you you love it so much you created a whole company specifically for real estate agents called cura to help them streamline so tell us about cura so cura was born out of my need for virtual assistant I had a daughter she came home early she was born 10 weeks early right oh wow
[00:20:48] it was scary like you know my wife was at home and she's now amazing she's running around but I realized after she was like six months old I'm like I need to delegate things away I can't keep doing be a present father and husband and not be there for my clients right I need to let go so I brought on a virtual assistant in 2023 and you know I had this whole idea of let's email every agent at a certain brokerage okay for the for the next year four times
[00:21:18] and see what happens so we emailed 90,000 emails that year love the next year we got four deals and I was like holy cow I got a four accent our ROI on this thing so I was at a retreat with a bunch of top agents around the country and they came up to me we're at dinner and they go how are you doing all this fine so quickly and what do you like what's the secret I said the VA and they're like can you help us find one and so I found two agents of VA and then my goal this year was hey let's find one virtual assistant
[00:21:48] per year or per month to help one agent by Easter we had 20 clients and I was like all right I need help so my cousin was the 25th employee of Uber and he he was retired and he goes he looked at the numbers and he's like this is amazing like tell me about it like what are you passionate about why are you doing this and I told him both first why I'm passionate about helping people in the Philippines why I'm passionate about helping people here and he's like I'm in so then he came in and then the chief of staff for Waymo the self driving car come
[00:22:18] with me who's friends with my cousin heard about it and he's like I'm in so it's us three running around you know three crazy guys running around and now we're up to 33 VA's since pretty much kind of like May we had you know we had the 20 clients but now we're we've we've tripled the size of the business in like three months and now we have this business exploded and that's why I wrote to you I was like I got I got to tell the world about this right we are real estate specific and what's specific about this I saw all these other VA companies I said what are they doing wrong
[00:22:49] and the biggest thing I said they were offering 40 hours a week most could you repeat that please you cut out just for a second yeah the biggest problem is agents cannot manage themselves for 40 hours right alone someone else yep right so we flipped the script and said it's kind of like a co-op right 10 hour buckets so we can have one VA working for two or three agents
[00:23:17] a lot of time and people can pull the resources to use these VA's and these VA's get right I can't afford to pay for someone full time yeah I need 10 hours and no one's going to work just 10 hours for me so I you have a pool of people that you can plug and play into their schedules and I can get that 10 hours exactly and the other thing to think about is retention so the other
[00:23:40] VA companies when a VA with lose their when they would lose if they lost their client for example like let's say the clients like hey I can't I can't afford this this quarter
[00:23:48] they be out of a job and what happens then they have to feed their families yeah so they go to another VA company with us if we lose a client like we had one the other day was like I just can't manage they're like I just don't know how to manage people I just it's not for me I'm an individual contributor I'm in New York I'm fast paced I can't slow down like that's cool
[00:24:06] she that VA has two other clients so they stay with us and they grow and it's seen this amazing growth of
[00:24:15] building things with real estate agents all over the country at different brokerages and there's a lot of things with tech you know text the sex
[00:24:23] equal thing but at the end of the day what we've seen is a lot of these agents they're not using the tech
[00:24:29] you for sure for sure they're not even using the tech so the VA's come in and they learn about the tech then they start using the tech right and I think that's that's been a really
[00:24:42] amazing thing to be able to wake up in the morning know you know we're helping people overseas and I'm also helping people here to to provide a better
[00:24:50] product to clients that are buying all over the country and I feel like I'm a part of that every day it's pretty cool really exciting tell us what the VA's
[00:24:58] some of the tasks they can actually do sure I mean I heard a great story today one was a client concierge and an agent of ours and she's a really big agent
[00:25:08] was married to an NFL player in Houston she has one of our our VA's calling all of her past clients as the the X team
[00:25:18] so it looks like they're from Houston saying hey we offer a concierge service you need any dinner reservations you need anything let us know I love that amazing
[00:25:26] the other thing is any listing she has is they're calling real estate agents throughout that neighborhood an area that has
[00:25:33] had done a deal in those areas and saying hey I'm from X Y and Z team we have this listing coming up we just want to let you be the first
[00:25:40] one to know if you have any buyers or you're looking for anything let us know we can get you in first and she's like
[00:25:45] and they're giving daily reports to the clients so the clients are like wow like you're everywhere like this is amazing you're
[00:25:51] co-calling people and then you're giving me daily reports on this like no one else is doing that so there's stuff like that's
[00:25:57] incredible incredible to hear and she told us that today so that was pretty that was an awesome story
[00:26:02] I want to go I'm going to totally break what we were just talking about virtual assistance because I wanted to go back
[00:26:08] I apologize for the non-continuity here but you it's something very important at the beginning and I just forgot to go
[00:26:14] back to it so I'm going to go back to it now and then we're going to go back in a virtual assistant this is not the way to
[00:26:18] us structure a well-flowing podcast but I think this is super important you said when at the very beginning when
[00:26:25] we were talking about your marketing background you would mention that you've sort of flipped the script and you
[00:26:30] were more interested in building relationships with other agents yes and all over the country which again
[00:26:36] yes it's really really smart because and we sort of kind of went past that I want to just real quickly
[00:26:42] take it quickly tour let's go into that why did you do that I I knew I wanted referrals inbound and
[00:26:50] I knew long term I didn't know if it was coaching or something but I knew I loved helping other agents
[00:26:56] and so right now I'm you can call me a manager whatever may be of of three agents on the
[00:27:01] second city agents team and a lot of people don't know that so I help you lie with with half the
[00:27:05] you know a quarter of the team but I loved connecting with other agents around the country I almost
[00:27:11] felt like I was like flying in and like traveling when I would connect with them and the biggest
[00:27:15] deal I've ever gotten was I was I remember this day I was mowing my grass and my assistant here
[00:27:23] locally said you just got a message about a referral for 2.1 million dollars come to
[00:27:30] you know and they flew in they bought the house and seven months later they were like hey we were
[00:27:35] here 20 years ago we were really not vibing with Ravenswood anymore can you sell the property
[00:27:39] so that I sold the property for I think it was like $250,000 more and then we bought another house
[00:27:45] in Winnecco for like two million dollars so it was like six million dollars in less than a year
[00:27:48] from from Instagram and it was the from the referral program or just like I just in my mind knew
[00:27:55] I wanted to start having inbound referrals and I and I knew it was bigger than just Chicago it's
[00:28:00] everywhere people are coming here we live in the third largest city in the richest country in the
[00:28:05] world and they're going to continue to move here right so I love that saying shout out Eli
[00:28:09] Masood for that line I love that line that is such a brilliant idea so really if you don't have
[00:28:17] an agent network think about adding that to your marketing plan and start thinking about how you can
[00:28:24] help agents in other parts of the country and where people who live in your your your area where
[00:28:30] they move to and where people move might move in from that start developing those relationships
[00:28:36] and building those connections and yeah oh that that's what I figured you were doing and I'm so
[00:28:42] glad that we took that quick detour let's go back to the virtual assistant play because
[00:28:46] uh and virtual assistants can help do this as well they can help this is how it started yeah I love
[00:28:51] this um so talk talk to me more about so I'm an agent and I'm I'm doing so many different hat
[00:28:58] I'm wearing so many different hats I'm doing so many different tasks and some things I'm good at
[00:29:02] some things I like to do other things I'm not as skilled at or and some things I just don't like
[00:29:07] to do as well and but I have to do them right and I trying to figure out what I should do and what
[00:29:14] I should delegate so maybe we should let's start there so if you were an agent trying to figure
[00:29:19] this out I know you've already figured this out for you yeah how would you start to think about
[00:29:24] because I want I want to make the case for is everybody needs a virtual assistant here so let's
[00:29:29] make the case how do you first figure out that you need one if everyone on this call or on this
[00:29:35] podcast is listening and has just thinks is there one thing that they could delegate away right now
[00:29:41] the answer is yes okay so then you got our group it you've got daily you've got weekly you've
[00:29:47] got monthly you've got quarterly tasks right and then you break that down I have this daily task
[00:29:54] this person's responsible are they trained on that and then you're tracking it okay and then
[00:30:00] you're analyzing is it working for my business and if you start with one task the first week
[00:30:05] maybe you start with one daily task and one weekly task then the second week you add another one
[00:30:10] and another one and after about a month to two months you've got eight daily task going and eight
[00:30:15] weekly task going and then you start adding in projects it's game over I mean driving back from
[00:30:20] the office to my home office I literally got on the phone and needed my assistant to create four
[00:30:27] emails blasts for different listings and upcoming summit I'm going to to speak at like I need all
[00:30:35] of this stuff done I don't have the time now I'll have the time to approve and approve for you
[00:30:39] but I don't have the time to build it out and she does and she's also doing all my other daily tasks so
[00:30:44] if that answers your question yes start with one to two things and do you have different VAs
[00:30:51] who have different skill sets doing different things or are they sort of trained in everything
[00:30:57] we do I always say that social media VAs can step back to admin stuff and usually admins can't
[00:31:02] step up to social media so right now we have a director of operations that does is is very
[00:31:08] proficient in social media and does all of our administration stuff and then we have a social media
[00:31:14] slash like BD person that creates a calendar and then every at the beginning of every month she
[00:31:20] sends me like 15 you know literally scripts and like what she wants me to do and she says do this
[00:31:26] record yourself and then send it to me and I'll make it look pretty and I do it in one day and it's
[00:31:32] done and I tell her to always tell me like a week in advance and then give me a deadline hold me
[00:31:36] accountable to that deadline so I have a virtualist this is funny I have a virtual assistant also from
[00:31:42] the Philippines and I by the way I so grateful that the Philippines is a nation that exists
[00:31:47] Nathan has the nicest people on the planet who live there and also the hardest working I mean they
[00:31:54] are just a treasure to to to work with if anyone's ever worked with anyone from the Philippines it is
[00:32:01] I've never had a back experience that I've we have a lot of experience with virtual assistants there
[00:32:06] and you're really helping them tremendously that is that is a country that really benefits from
[00:32:12] from this exact sort of opportunity and I have one her her name is Janika she is my right hand woman
[00:32:18] and she helps me in business she also wakes me up every morning at 6 a.m and she calls me now it's
[00:32:24] not 6 a.m. her time of course it's like 6 p.m. so it's no big deal for her and she doesn't it's not
[00:32:30] like I'm this lazy American who's like I have to have somebody wake me up no I set my alarm for
[00:32:35] 555 so that she doesn't actually have to call me at 6 but just in case I sleep through it and I don't
[00:32:40] send her that message at 555 then she at 6 a.m. she will you know click on WhatsApp give me a quick
[00:32:48] call it's time to wake up now in the two years she's been doing this for me she's only ever had to
[00:32:53] call me once or twice and the rest is like I'm just too embarrassed so I immediately wake up I go
[00:32:57] Jenna guy I'm up I'm up but this was something I needed because I struggled to get up in the morning
[00:33:02] and it you know it's it you can have virtual assistance help with this now takes her all of 15 seconds
[00:33:09] to just you know call me or whatever it's like no big deal to her she's getting paid for it
[00:33:13] and I have her helping me schedule plan dates with my with my partner with the girlfriend she's
[00:33:20] saying here's all the cool things going on in Chicago this weekend what do you want to do dinner
[00:33:24] reservations and things like that too so you know virtual assistants are so helpful because you
[00:33:30] know I don't want to spend it's not that I don't want to find cool things to do with my girlfriend I do
[00:33:35] I just don't want to search for all the cool things I want all the cool things to come to me and then
[00:33:40] I just filter through those top 30 like or in your case the scripts you're getting for your social
[00:33:45] media content right you want that brought to you and then you can make those decisions much more
[00:33:50] quickly and then also that accountability piece is so important is having you give me a due date
[00:33:56] make sure I'm doing it and we all need accountability too I love this but it really is this thing that
[00:34:02] if if you're listening and you're like thinking I don't know how to give up that control
[00:34:08] then work on that because you will benefit so much by not digging your your claws into every part
[00:34:16] of your business and trying to hold on to everything and do it yourself you're just not going
[00:34:20] to be able to this is the bottom line and we also know that multitasking it's been well proven it
[00:34:25] does not work nobody can do it virtually nobody is good at multitasking and real estate agents are all
[00:34:31] having to multitask all day long because that's just the nature of the job so virtual assistants can
[00:34:36] help you do that and what I love about Kura is that you have specialized people for different tasks
[00:34:42] because this is a problem for people when they start looking at virtual assistants a lot of times
[00:34:47] they'll go on up work they'll submit you know to try to find someone and then they get 100 resumes
[00:34:53] and they're like gosh I don't know who to choose I don't know you know they can look at reviews
[00:34:57] and that's good but can this person do everything like you said could they do social media and admin
[00:35:03] tasks probably not well if they could do admin tasks they probably can't do social media but
[00:35:07] the reverse maybe works so you really need somebody who's got a team in place specific to real estate
[00:35:16] stuff and that's what you've built and so I mean we're talking about also what I what I love is
[00:35:24] I'm assuming your virtual assistants can also do things like you get a client and then they can
[00:35:28] start to create a calendar you know if you're all the important dates and they can reach out to you
[00:35:33] and say today's the day you need to call so and so and let them know it's 45 days before closing
[00:35:37] or whatever exactly they could do all that so yet did you build a lot of those systems and then
[00:35:43] train the staff on them or are you having where are you picking up some of these systems we're picking
[00:35:48] up I mean we put a lot of we create systems and videos we record them we then have them go through
[00:35:55] about a month onboarding process and then they will start working with the real estate agents so
[00:35:59] there's also we launched a cura academy which is partnered with like another company that essentially
[00:36:04] they can take continual education for free to level them up so we believe that they should
[00:36:09] continue to learn and progress through their career either with us or somewhere else I want them
[00:36:14] to continue to learn and also having like we have monthly jam sessions where we have one of like
[00:36:19] for example we had his name's A.C. He was working for an agent in Nashville and we heard about this
[00:36:24] amazing document that he created Excel document where he plugs all the information in from all of
[00:36:29] homes.com all the different websites right and then it essentially creates an email he takes that
[00:36:35] email and the listing age it looks at it and then sends it out for his listing report every week to
[00:36:40] his sellers so it's just like stuff like that it gets better and better and better over time because
[00:36:45] we're only working with real estate agents and our VA's are all it's like a round table of talking
[00:36:50] and if like they don't know the answer they'll go to one of the other 32 and if the 32 don't know
[00:36:54] it and my VA doesn't know it and I don't know it then it probably doesn't exist possibly
[00:36:59] or we do some research on it we figured out. I always think too that CRM's are often neglected
[00:37:05] and not not so much in the daily activities that people use them and know what they need to do day to
[00:37:11] day but in updating the data for the client and a virtual assistant is like the perfect person
[00:37:17] to be able to call every single person in your CRM or past clients and say hey I just want to make
[00:37:23] sure we have your birthday correct in here I just want to make sure we have XYZ data in here
[00:37:28] even if you want to know somebody's wedding anniversary or whatever information you want maybe
[00:37:34] their kids ages or birthdays you know you could have that person call on behalf of you and say
[00:37:38] well you know we're updating your data we want to celebrate your birthday every year we don't have it
[00:37:42] what is it when is your birthday and that's a touch point DJ yes that's a touch point because they
[00:37:47] saw that your team reached out and actually cared about them and then they remember you right and
[00:37:53] that's that's where a lot of agents are missing or missing it you know that too so it's kind of
[00:37:57] crazy so it's just small little touches like that just takes it to the next level yeah let's talk
[00:38:03] about so if I'm so if I'm so I'm an agent I've now thought about some tasks that I do for example
[00:38:10] I some some agents are really great at every day on Facebook they see the list of happy birthdays
[00:38:15] or the birthday you know or the you know the tunnel LinkedIn as well and then they start sending
[00:38:20] messages to people however they want to do that but that takes takes time it's a fairly repetitive
[00:38:25] task and something that probably could be automated or at least delegated rather not automated
[00:38:32] delegated to a virtual assistant so even things like that could be you know super helpful
[00:38:38] totally I mean transaction coordination chief of staff client concierge lead follow up I mean
[00:38:46] there's so many things that you can delegate away it's wild like the one where that you have your
[00:38:50] VA calling I'm like holy cow I should probably implement that because I always hit snooze so at like
[00:38:55] six a.m. you're earlier than me well it's what's funny is the yeah that's helpful for me but one
[00:39:01] thing that's really helpful for my relationship is she she will say okay you have to plan not my
[00:39:07] my girlfriend but my virtual assistant I've told her make sure I plan at least one date every single
[00:39:13] week and you know by Wednesday I have to have the date planned because if I don't then you know
[00:39:20] it's going to be really hard to get it done in time for the weekend so yeah so we have a we have a
[00:39:24] process for even things like that because and another thing she's done is even people in my personal
[00:39:30] life who I want to make sure I stay connected to it and again you can translate this over to business
[00:39:34] is she makes sure that I'm calling my friends every so often I want to make sure I'm staying in touch
[00:39:40] with so and so every 90 days you know just to you know for my own personal but again business stuff
[00:39:45] yeah this is this is all things that virtual assistants can absolutely do and keep you productive
[00:39:51] so if somebody wanted to explore Kura what's the process how did they get involved?
[00:39:57] so you go to work with Kura.com you'd fill out the form then we have an initial consultation
[00:40:02] okay and then you would have an interview with the VA's and then from there we would have a
[00:40:09] weekly call with you every single month after that free of charge and then a monthly call after
[00:40:15] that as well so that's what you're occurring to just to make sure we value the feedback of the agents
[00:40:20] to hear about like what's going right what's going wrong what are you creating with the VA's
[00:40:24] and just almost like a mastermind group of content and we're just to pump it out as much as we can
[00:40:30] if we find something that's valuable we'll send out to all the agents as well so oh that's really
[00:40:34] cool too yeah some extra like hey so and so in a different total part of the oh I love that it's
[00:40:40] it's a group thing kind of it's like a group thing yep yep yep mastermind yep it's a mastermind
[00:40:45] yeah it's for you people are like people are blown away they're like how are you not charging like
[00:40:50] for at least extra things and I'm like we shouldn't we should make this is but is the best possible
[00:40:55] version it can be and it as simple as possible right and that's what's special about it so I think
[00:41:00] that's why it's been growing so fast that's amazing and you can choose the number of hours I'm sure
[00:41:05] you have packages you have yeah it's all in the web it's all in the website you know exactly what
[00:41:09] the prices are going to be you know exactly how it works and then one of us will get in contact
[00:41:13] with with you as well so what if you estimated because you're a data guy what would you estimate
[00:41:19] your ROI is on a virtual assistant not not as an owner of Kura but just as an agent yourself
[00:41:26] well for me I mean it was 4x last year I mean I mean I I brought in I think I spent like
[00:41:32] $10,000 last year and I brought in about 40,000 on and it was specifically though like I could tie it
[00:41:37] it was emails outbound bulk emails the agents saw them they emailed me back said hey have a client
[00:41:43] I saw your email a couple months prior because they don't delete their emails right they're in the
[00:41:47] bucks so they searched they searched Chicago because we send four emails a year about cool things
[00:41:52] about the city we love like the best tropical restaurants stuff that's really out there right
[00:41:57] marketing right and and then I also bonus my VA as well because you did this work you should be
[00:42:04] incentivized as well just like me so but then I hear stories like in Houston where she got three
[00:42:09] listings for like four million dollars from calling just calling past clients just saying hey we're
[00:42:14] checking in how are you doing oh hey could you come by I want to possibly sell my house I didn't even
[00:42:20] know that till today she her name's Alicia she told me this I was like wow that's that's incredible
[00:42:24] so the ROI I mean it's endless on it if you get one deal it pretty much pays for a VA right one deal
[00:42:31] pays for a VA a part-time VA so I mean if you can't get one deal a year because of the the systems
[00:42:38] you're having them do you need to look at the systems and say is this going to give me an ROI and
[00:42:42] then if it's not cut it so yeah it's it's really really smart we were talking about his efficiency
[00:42:49] and and and effectiveness too and you and you're also leveling up your VA's you know you're not
[00:42:56] just they're not just staying at their current skill level you you have an academy where they're
[00:43:00] learning new skills I imagine you're you're pushing them hard with AI right now I would imagine
[00:43:06] that is a big thing because they can do so much more with AI than then we'll be able to do because
[00:43:12] they'll they'll be able to interface with it more often yeah totally and like if you look at it
[00:43:17] I tell everyone to get Chatchee Bt pro or whatever maybe complexity whatever
[00:43:22] maybe use it for a few weeks by yourself then give your VA your login and now they are speaking
[00:43:28] and they sound like your brand all the agents want to say I want to be on brand I want to be on brand
[00:43:33] well now they can speak like you like my my I always say let's go in everything Chatchee Bt now says
[00:43:40] let's go all the time it's like super positive about going it is me right and now my VA is me
[00:43:47] but in the Philippines so it's kind of crazy it is crazy that's really interesting so you've trained
[00:43:53] Chatchee Bt on your particular personality and your your mannerisms and your your style your
[00:43:59] aesthetic yeah and the way that you communicate and yeah I've done the same thing I I talk to
[00:44:05] Chatchee Bt all all day long or neem and not all day long but certainly I love being able to talk
[00:44:11] to it and have conversations and it again it starts to change the way it reflects back to me
[00:44:17] based on you know what it knows about me and then giving them the VA the login is really smart
[00:44:25] because then now it is speaking in your voice yes oh wow I never would have thought to do that
[00:44:30] that is because that is you just solved a major problem because we think about this a lot we say
[00:44:36] okay I'm going to hire a virtual assistant but they they live in a different country they don't
[00:44:41] maybe understand my culture or our culture we just have different backgrounds different histories
[00:44:47] and they have different values and of course they do different ways of being marketed to even
[00:44:53] you know different fonts appeal to different people in different cultures things like that different
[00:44:57] collars it's all different and we can't expect somebody who lives in a different country to know
[00:45:03] all of the ways in which Americans are you know what light up Americans but Chatchee Bt
[00:45:10] knows what lights you up and you know what lights up your your audience and so now it's speaking
[00:45:16] in that language and they don't have to try to figure it out Chatchee Bt will help them with that
[00:45:22] with that messaging that is really smart yeah I mean it's the biggest thing I've heard from
[00:45:27] agencies I want to be on brand I want to be on brand yeah this is how you be on brand like it
[00:45:34] knows your voice and some teams or some some agents will have multiple agents and I'm like and
[00:45:38] they're using the same VA I'm like give them logins for both so now they have the voice of both of
[00:45:42] you right so and that and I give them I would even give my agents if they ever needed to do
[00:45:48] anything for me I would give them my log in and they can use it and it speaks like me so silver time
[00:45:53] well I am excited I'm waiting for the just to go off script a moment I'm waiting for the day
[00:45:59] that AI and I don't know when that's coming if it's coming but I hope it is where it thinks of an
[00:46:06] idea for me on its own and says hey DJ I was just thinking about this I got an idea for you wow
[00:46:14] I'm waiting for that I'm we may we may be going away no it's going to be there I mean look at what
[00:46:19] happened with with the iPhone today the new update yeah it's you can now I could have an
[00:46:23] air pod in my in my ear and you could be speaking Spanish you'll be reading it will be translated
[00:46:27] into my ear are you kidding me I've just ordered the new air pod three they come out well they're
[00:46:33] not shipped they're not shipping yet they're shipping I think middle of next month I think or
[00:46:37] the end of this month so yeah I've ordered it I'm excited to test that out I had a guy at my
[00:46:42] my place yesterday who was a handy man he was plumber fixing something and he was Ukrainian and he
[00:46:49] really didn't speak English and we were speaking through Google translate which is pretty
[00:46:53] effective but it's you know I have to type it out and then I have to play it and then he has to
[00:46:57] hear it and you were going to be able to just you know do it through through the air pods now yeah
[00:47:03] yeah it's very very exciting I think the future is is really figuring out efficiency and and what's
[00:47:10] so great about this and I know you agree is that it allows the agent it feels overwhelming at first
[00:47:16] and it feels like a really stressful sort of thing to move things over to somebody else and put
[00:47:22] a lot of trust in faith and yeah maybe initially you're going to work a little harder to train them
[00:47:28] and get them up to speed and yeah there's going to be that discomfort there like there is whenever
[00:47:32] you try anything new and like I'm learning notion right now as a as a tool and it's bending my mind
[00:47:40] it's it's really I'm having a hard time grasping it but I'm right on the precipice of figuring out
[00:47:45] why this can completely organize my life and probably I should have a VA who's an expert at
[00:47:50] notion as well help me with it and you know it's it's frustrating I'm like I'm I'm almost there
[00:47:56] but I know once I figure it out it's going to allow me to to do what I do best which is not
[00:48:02] organize my life because I'm not good at that and I need help with that so I think it's first
[00:48:08] like identifying what you're not good at but you know needs to get done like I'm not good at you
[00:48:14] calling my clients right that's a big one I'm not good at calling my past clients and checking in
[00:48:19] with them I I don't like doing that it's not something I'm good at okay there's a solution for that
[00:48:24] right we can figure that out and maybe you do have to make those calls maybe that is something you
[00:48:30] have to do but the chat chbt along with a virtual assistant can give you 25 reasons to call somebody
[00:48:35] and yep with with items of value right now so I love that that cura is this company that is really
[00:48:42] taking virtual assistants which let's let's face it virtual assistants can be they can have jobs
[00:48:48] in all sorts of different industries and it's tough on them they it's gotta be rough and I love
[00:48:53] that you're taking them and specifically plugging them straight into real estate so that's kind of
[00:48:58] their main focus along with in real estate as all sorts of spokes as well we've got working and
[00:49:03] and customer service and and just obviously operations and compliance and and all this stuff and
[00:49:08] you're training them you're making sure that that team knows real estate processes and efficiencies
[00:49:15] and optimizations and then I come to you and say great I don't have to train somebody I just want
[00:49:20] to find somebody you know I absolutely have to tweak a little bit I'm sure but somebody who's
[00:49:24] already got experience knows what they're doing and I trust you because you're in this business
[00:49:30] you know what works and I think this is just a really really great great product so for anyone
[00:49:37] out there who is not currently using a VA wants to explore how to 4x their you know their investment
[00:49:44] which again I don't think that's I don't think that's an outlier I think that's pretty reasonable
[00:49:50] I would say I probably have a similar experience I use a VA's a little bit differently than you do
[00:49:57] but I would say I've probably yeah had a similar ROI and I need to figure out how to measure that
[00:50:04] because I'd like to know exactly but I've been using VA's for years they have saved me in so
[00:50:08] many different ways and you know I think this is such a smart idea also we should mention that you
[00:50:15] know you do work with agents all over the country we are a market here that Chicago people don't
[00:50:21] always stay here in Chicago they go elsewhere a lot of times they go to Florida they go to Texas they go
[00:50:25] well really anywhere that's warmer especially in the wintertime and when they retire so you obviously
[00:50:32] want to continue making those relationships stronger with or new relationships so we have thousands
[00:50:38] and thousands of listeners guys so if you like what you've been hearing from Jared if you think this
[00:50:43] is the kind of team I want to partner with and we didn't even talk so much about what you do but

And now on to our show. Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team? Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now. And which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you now. I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration. This is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now onto the show. Hello and welcome to another episode of keeping it real the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I am your guide. I am your host through the show. And in just a moment we're going to be speaking with top producer Jarrett Jarvis before we get to Jarrett. Just a quick reminder. First of all, if you are new to the podcast, welcome. We appreciate you being here. If you are returning, we appreciate you as well. Also I have started a new video series a short form video series. Two to three episodes a week 60 seconds long. This is called the AI agent men every other day or so. I create an AI prompt that you can drop into chat. I'm going to get to the next level with your business. These are prompts that top 1% agents have told me they use or prompts I am using myself. So where you can get these not here unfortunately, but on all the different social channels we are on find keeping it real. Hit that subscribe button and let me know what you think of the AI agent minute my conversation with Jarrett Jarvis. I was the best piece of advice you've received real estate. The best piece of advice that I've received is stop trying to do everything yourself. So once I started delegating away and really structuring my business with processes and people. My business just grew and stress went down. So that's probably the best word advice that I've received worst piece of advice. Just work harder. So in real estate, you can always find more to do. Right. And I think we're all very competitive. We talked about this together earlier on the call. And I think systems and people beat hustle right. So it goes back to the people delegation getting the right people in place will really let you scale and you don't have to work hard. You just got to really work smarter. Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense because you're right. We can always be busy and that can feel productive. And then if we were flecked on what we've done over that time period, it's not always productive. And I know I fall into that trap. So I appreciate that advice by guest today is Jarrett Jarvis from second city agents with Compass. He is in Chicago. Let me tell you more about Jarrett. Jarrett is a licensed real estate agent with Compass realty who is sold over 200 homes and has been featured on HD TV, bar still sports and also featured in real producers magazine. He is also the founder and CEO of cura, a virtual assistant company that helps real estate agents streamline operations, scale their businesses and focus on serving clients before transitioning into real estate. Jarrett worked with Fortune 500 companies as a channel marketing specialist collaborating with remodellers builders and architects, a marketing graduate from Illinois State University. He is known for a strong work ethic creative strategy and deep commitment to his clients born and raised in Chicago. He now lives in Irving Park with his wife Elise, their daughter Sienna, their dog Wyatt and also manages 20 rental units as an active investor. So he's doing a lot. I want you to follow Jarrett at his Instagram on his Instagram, which is homes of Chicago and check out his virtual assistant company. We're going to be talking about that today that is work with cura, see you are a work with cura.com will have links to both of those in the show notes. Jarrett, welcome. Thanks for the intro DJ. That was great. I appreciate it. It's always fun for me to get to know, you know, especially people here locally in Chicago do as many Chicago interviews anymore. I started only doing Chicago interviews because that was the only people I had the confidence to even ask, you know, would you come on my show? Yeah. Now I don't get to do as many. So I appreciate that. You and I have some mutual friends and I really admire your team, your team at Compass. I know many of those agents and they're all just great agents and excited to have you have you here. So I want to talk a little bit. I love that you have a marketing background. That's my background as well. And I want to sort of dive into that first and just kind of understand how you think about marketing because that is something that you probably bring up a particular skill set or a lot of agents, you know, struggle on the marketing side. So tell us a little bit about, you know, how you market your business. Sure. I think that brand is everything, right? I think as you stated earlier, it's homes of Chicago. And right when I started from the beginning, I wanted to be the go to Chicago agent for real estate agents nationwide. I didn't think about actual clients. I thought about how do I get out to a broader section of people. So it was a completely different mindset. So my marketing mindset is completely the opposite of what people are doing. So if you're going A, I'm going B, right? It's also guerrilla marketing tactics, right? Like doing different things on social media, like top 30 list, like one of our videos got 60,000 views. It was usually it's top 10, right? It's a top 10 list. Yeah. I said, let's do a top 10 of ramen noodle soup. Soup super random. Have I ate it all those places? Maybe maybe I haven't. You don't know that. But 60,000 people tuned into that video and we're requesting and debating about ramen noodle soup. By the way, I'm going to jump in for a second because this is such a brilliant video. I love ramen and there are there are, you know, maybe 100 ramen places here in the. Yeah, I go or close to it. There probably really is about 100 and I every time I always forget which is the best. I literally just can't remember because I have a terrible memory and I always go on to Google. Well, I would use chat, she'd be tea to help me, but I always go or YouTube and I would say or Reddit and I would say it's the very best ramen right now because new ones pop up all the time. Sure. And it's so funny that you made that video because that is such a brilliant video because I think me would have found that video. I might have found that video and it's just a great idea for marketing because yeah, 60,000 people. I mean, the ramen is such a great example of that. Yeah, exactly. And I don't think it has to be all about like marketing. You really need to know who your target market is, right? And you really need to think outside the box like how can you help people with a problem, right? And for our clients, as you know, in real estate, they're looking for you to be the solution for it's not just the real estate transaction. It's everything in life from engagement rings to the best ramen places to, you know, a lot of my followers now are real estate is around the country because I'm on one of the top teams in Chicago. I'm using virtual assistants and now they're looking at me for how what is he using a virtual system for right like I have been posted on social media this year myself once it's my VAs right I'm behind the scenes creating the concept like looking at the content, proving the content and stamping it. But then it goes out and it's it's out to the world. So it's been pretty cool. Yeah, I love that I want to dive into this problem solving methodology because this is a marketing sort of paradigm shift that once somebody gets it specifically around solving problems related to what your clients are experiencing and may not be related to real estate, right? Like ramen. It might be dinner what I'm going to have for dinner or maybe it is real estate related tangentially like where's the best, you know, grocery store in this particular neighborhood or how close to my to the subway system here in Chicago we call the L or things like that where the best places to live for, you know, X Y or Z. I think those are absolutely how I know that's how I search on line and I'm always looking for answers to those questions I were going on a trip to the Northeast in next week and I specifically was looking at like where the best places to visit in May new Hampshire and Vermont and those are searches I do and those are video searches I do. And you're right 60,000 people will find that and what I love about YouTube in particular that a lot of agents sort of neglect YouTube they focus more on Instagram and Facebook and TikTok and those are great but those are sort of flash in the pan digestible they go away they don't I mean they do technically live forever but they don't the algorithm doesn't really favor older content but YouTube does favor older content if it's good and that stuff just lives forever and you can continually get leads I'm sure you do. Yeah totally. From those kind of videos so you know when you start to think about problems that your clients have it must be pretty fun to do that because then you just think about content creation. Well I mean yeah I mean like one of the things I one of the problems we saw with with clients for example was we're moving in a new house we need a ton of new furniture yeah and if you've moved before DJ you know it's extremely expensive to buy furniture. How many agents out there have trade discounts or even know what trade discounts are like if you have an LLC and you're a real estate agent you can message every major top brand out there and you can get 20 to 40% off discount codes that you can provide your clients and so just having that sheet to send out to your clients when they move or posting on social media people are like hey like I didn't buy with you I bought with my other this other person like why didn't they give me a trade day discount can you give me the trade absolutely like I'll give you a tiny one right and it's that going back to help with this and how do you solve that's just an example that is a great example I've never heard of that so I love that so if you have an LLC or an S corporation you have a company for your real estate practice as Jared says reach out to the furniture manufacturers and see if they're gosh I didn't know that even DJ you could even reach out to create a barrel. We're all trading discount right 30% off like the container store our house all those webs all those different companies I'm thinking about so I'm looking to put my place on the market and I have to get it you know just things patched up and and you know scuffs marked out you know that kind of thing and I realized I have this one of my one of my I guess baseboards is got some water and it kind of expanded so I have to replace it and I'm like I don't know who does that I mean I can find somebody on tasker and I could just look it up but I'm I would much rather go to somebody like you probably knows who the best handyman are and or you know you would have that resource and I like I have a license I don't really use it but I don't know who to go to so those are things that people are going to everybody I always think like probably everybody owns a property could always use a handyman any given time while they're living there like there's always a project that isn't finished totally something to be fixed up so handyman stuff is super helpful. Oh yeah I mean you have to have that especially as our careers have progressed we're now getting more into the listings and we have to have a whole team come in and quickly get this house up to what the quality that we like to list right so I mean we have to pretty much handyman that are working around at Chicago and area and electrician plumber drywall or all that stuff so yeah. Yeah well let's talk about some trends that you've noticed and you know how are buyers and sellers changing these days I know you've mentioned there's been some shifts and curious to know sort of what you're witnessing. Well in the buyer side they are definitely hyper focused on the rate I would say because you know this generation saw the rates dropped in the 2s and 3s and they don't really understand the concept of why did that happen and why did it go back so quickly and now it's going down and for example like I have clients under contract right now they got a 6.75 interest rate from one mortgage broker and the other one just beat him by a half a point. Wow okay and they're like why is that happen and I'm like that's a great question right now did that mortgage broker not lock in the rates the rates went up today who knows but I think they're super hyper focused on that I also think that now with Chatchy BT and AI they can really really be just really really know a lot more about the home buying process at at their fingertips like you can take a photo of an AC unit in Chatchy BT post it and say what years this and the serial number instantly tells me how what's the life like expectancy and how long how long has been so I would say that and then on the selling side right it's they are expecting the house to really be marketed in a very I would say visually impactful way right like I had a client the other day was like hey should we virtually stage this like if we take we're going to remove all the all the furniture that's in there because it's a renter and we're going to virtually stage it and I said hey if you're scrolling through 80 80 places today okay and you see a property that's empty okay and then you see a property that has staged furniture virtually staged you may not even know if it's virtually stage because it's so good sure but you can envision your your dining room table being in that kitchen you can imagine your couch being in that living room that gets your minds thinking and slows you down just a little bit from not scrolling every second maybe every three seconds I think it's going to get attached to that house right so I think sellers are really expecting us to really step our games up from an artificial standpoint also like listing descriptions like you see these listing descriptions that are like 250 400 500 words yeah we're doing a thousand to 2000 wow SEO we're trying to get SEO we're trying to get as many views on those properties as possible so for listing descriptions are what's your thought process there for longer descriptions is it I want to tell a story is it you know kind of walk me through that a little bit we gather as much details about the mechanics and any updates they don't we do I mean I take photos of every single major mechanical product that when we go through the walkthrough right so I have that so they don't have to fill out the whole description of like because they don't know right the age of the washing machines sure we have all that details we then ask them if there's any favorite restaurants shopping or parks that they like an area thing that they like do with their kids or family and then we take all of that data and then we take you know more information about that property as well we put it into chat you be T or AI it spits out you know we put in the MLS rules because it has the MLS rules I'll say please audit this to the MLS rules and it provides this amazing content sometimes it will put like restaurants in there and you you know I do my do do just look it up and it's like this is we're not going to market a fast food restaurant that has five stars are like five five star reviews like there's no one going there but it gives a really good output and then you know you just let the SEO come in which is great so so that's one of the that's how we look at it from a character standpoint I love that you're you are all in on AI I am doing a lot with it myself and I'm I'm learning and we're doing videos just for anyone listening if you're not currently a subscriber to our social channels please do look us up keeping it real where everywhere on all the channels we do short form video there where I do an AI prompt two to three times a week for eight agents that they can use to help grow their business and one of the things and I know you do this with your AI prompts is really thinking about crafting the query is is really the most important way and so I do this with YouTube descriptions I suspect you might do the same where I upload a video I put just you know my version of a description in and then I have you to review the video or sorry I have chat GPT review the video and then say acting as an SEO specialist that understand the YouTube algorithm and here's who I'm looking to attract to this video here's what here's what I'm looking to with the YouTube algorithm to do for me please rewrite the description in a you know engaging way and you can really just get hyper specific about it now you know and it always comes up with something better than I could have done so totally no I mean and talking to it like that it takes a moment for people to write like I want this to be elegant yep 1000 characters I want you to include restaurants I want you to include local parks schools like you have to talk to it in a certain way and then you have to give it more details at the end of massage it so it's not perfect but like it gets better and better the more you talk to it which at like the pro version at least so I love that you're using AI you also are really big with virtual assistance I am as well I'm all an un virtual assistance they make my life so much better and I'm so grateful that we live in a world where I can have people that you know from all over the world who are willing to you know work with me they're effective they're efficient they're super knowledgeable and let's talk a little bit about it you you love it so much you created a whole company specifically for real estate agents called cura to help them streamline so tell us about cura so cura was born out of my need for virtual assistant I had a daughter she came home early she was born 10 weeks early right oh wow it was scary like you know my wife was at home and she's now amazing she's running around but I realized after she was like six months old I'm like I need to delegate things away I can't keep doing be a present father and husband and not be there for my clients right I need to let go so I brought on a virtual assistant in 2023 and you know I had this whole idea of let's email every agent at a certain brokerage okay for the for the next year four times and see what happens so we emailed 90,000 emails that year love the next year we got four deals and I was like holy cow I got a four accent our ROI on this thing so I was at a retreat with a bunch of top agents around the country and they came up to me we're at dinner and they go how are you doing all this fine so quickly and what do you like what's the secret I said the VA and they're like can you help us find one and so I found two agents of VA and then my goal this year was hey let's find one virtual assistant per year or per month to help one agent by Easter we had 20 clients and I was like all right I need help so my cousin was the 25th employee of Uber and he he was retired and he goes he looked at the numbers and he's like this is amazing like tell me about it like what are you passionate about why are you doing this and I told him both first why I'm passionate about helping people in the Philippines why I'm passionate about helping people here and he's like I'm in so then he came in and then the chief of staff for Waymo the self driving car come with me who's friends with my cousin heard about it and he's like I'm in so it's us three running around you know three crazy guys running around and now we're up to 33 VA's since pretty much kind of like May we had you know we had the 20 clients but now we're we've we've tripled the size of the business in like three months and now we have this business exploded and that's why I wrote to you I was like I got I got to tell the world about this right we are real estate specific and what's specific about this I saw all these other VA companies I said what are they doing wrong and the biggest thing I said they were offering 40 hours a week most could you repeat that please you cut out just for a second yeah the biggest problem is agents cannot manage themselves for 40 hours right alone someone else yep right so we flipped the script and said it's kind of like a co-op right 10 hour buckets so we can have one VA working for two or three agents a lot of time and people can pull the resources to use these VA's and these VA's get right I can't afford to pay for someone full time yeah I need 10 hours and no one's going to work just 10 hours for me so I you have a pool of people that you can plug and play into their schedules and I can get that 10 hours exactly and the other thing to think about is retention so the other VA companies when a VA with lose their when they would lose if they lost their client for example like let's say the clients like hey I can't I can't afford this this quarter they be out of a job and what happens then they have to feed their families yeah so they go to another VA company with us if we lose a client like we had one the other day was like I just can't manage they're like I just don't know how to manage people I just it's not for me I'm an individual contributor I'm in New York I'm fast paced I can't slow down like that's cool she that VA has two other clients so they stay with us and they grow and it's seen this amazing growth of building things with real estate agents all over the country at different brokerages and there's a lot of things with tech you know text the sex equal thing but at the end of the day what we've seen is a lot of these agents they're not using the tech you for sure for sure they're not even using the tech so the VA's come in and they learn about the tech then they start using the tech right and I think that's that's been a really amazing thing to be able to wake up in the morning know you know we're helping people overseas and I'm also helping people here to to provide a better product to clients that are buying all over the country and I feel like I'm a part of that every day it's pretty cool really exciting tell us what the VA's some of the tasks they can actually do sure I mean I heard a great story today one was a client concierge and an agent of ours and she's a really big agent was married to an NFL player in Houston she has one of our our VA's calling all of her past clients as the the X team so it looks like they're from Houston saying hey we offer a concierge service you need any dinner reservations you need anything let us know I love that amazing the other thing is any listing she has is they're calling real estate agents throughout that neighborhood an area that has had done a deal in those areas and saying hey I'm from X Y and Z team we have this listing coming up we just want to let you be the first one to know if you have any buyers or you're looking for anything let us know we can get you in first and she's like and they're giving daily reports to the clients so the clients are like wow like you're everywhere like this is amazing you're co-calling people and then you're giving me daily reports on this like no one else is doing that so there's stuff like that's incredible incredible to hear and she told us that today so that was pretty that was an awesome story I want to go I'm going to totally break what we were just talking about virtual assistance because I wanted to go back I apologize for the non-continuity here but you it's something very important at the beginning and I just forgot to go back to it so I'm going to go back to it now and then we're going to go back in a virtual assistant this is not the way to us structure a well-flowing podcast but I think this is super important you said when at the very beginning when we were talking about your marketing background you would mention that you've sort of flipped the script and you were more interested in building relationships with other agents yes and all over the country which again yes it's really really smart because and we sort of kind of went past that I want to just real quickly take it quickly tour let's go into that why did you do that I I knew I wanted referrals inbound and I knew long term I didn't know if it was coaching or something but I knew I loved helping other agents and so right now I'm you can call me a manager whatever may be of of three agents on the second city agents team and a lot of people don't know that so I help you lie with with half the you know a quarter of the team but I loved connecting with other agents around the country I almost felt like I was like flying in and like traveling when I would connect with them and the biggest deal I've ever gotten was I was I remember this day I was mowing my grass and my assistant here locally said you just got a message about a referral for 2.1 million dollars come to you know and they flew in they bought the house and seven months later they were like hey we were here 20 years ago we were really not vibing with Ravenswood anymore can you sell the property so that I sold the property for I think it was like $250,000 more and then we bought another house in Winnecco for like two million dollars so it was like six million dollars in less than a year from from Instagram and it was the from the referral program or just like I just in my mind knew I wanted to start having inbound referrals and I and I knew it was bigger than just Chicago it's everywhere people are coming here we live in the third largest city in the richest country in the world and they're going to continue to move here right so I love that saying shout out Eli Masood for that line I love that line that is such a brilliant idea so really if you don't have an agent network think about adding that to your marketing plan and start thinking about how you can help agents in other parts of the country and where people who live in your your your area where they move to and where people move might move in from that start developing those relationships and building those connections and yeah oh that that's what I figured you were doing and I'm so glad that we took that quick detour let's go back to the virtual assistant play because uh and virtual assistants can help do this as well they can help this is how it started yeah I love this um so talk talk to me more about so I'm an agent and I'm I'm doing so many different hat I'm wearing so many different hats I'm doing so many different tasks and some things I'm good at some things I like to do other things I'm not as skilled at or and some things I just don't like to do as well and but I have to do them right and I trying to figure out what I should do and what I should delegate so maybe we should let's start there so if you were an agent trying to figure this out I know you've already figured this out for you yeah how would you start to think about because I want I want to make the case for is everybody needs a virtual assistant here so let's make the case how do you first figure out that you need one if everyone on this call or on this podcast is listening and has just thinks is there one thing that they could delegate away right now the answer is yes okay so then you got our group it you've got daily you've got weekly you've got monthly you've got quarterly tasks right and then you break that down I have this daily task this person's responsible are they trained on that and then you're tracking it okay and then you're analyzing is it working for my business and if you start with one task the first week maybe you start with one daily task and one weekly task then the second week you add another one and another one and after about a month to two months you've got eight daily task going and eight weekly task going and then you start adding in projects it's game over I mean driving back from the office to my home office I literally got on the phone and needed my assistant to create four emails blasts for different listings and upcoming summit I'm going to to speak at like I need all of this stuff done I don't have the time now I'll have the time to approve and approve for you but I don't have the time to build it out and she does and she's also doing all my other daily tasks so if that answers your question yes start with one to two things and do you have different VAs who have different skill sets doing different things or are they sort of trained in everything we do I always say that social media VAs can step back to admin stuff and usually admins can't step up to social media so right now we have a director of operations that does is is very proficient in social media and does all of our administration stuff and then we have a social media slash like BD person that creates a calendar and then every at the beginning of every month she sends me like 15 you know literally scripts and like what she wants me to do and she says do this record yourself and then send it to me and I'll make it look pretty and I do it in one day and it's done and I tell her to always tell me like a week in advance and then give me a deadline hold me accountable to that deadline so I have a virtualist this is funny I have a virtual assistant also from the Philippines and I by the way I so grateful that the Philippines is a nation that exists Nathan has the nicest people on the planet who live there and also the hardest working I mean they are just a treasure to to to work with if anyone's ever worked with anyone from the Philippines it is I've never had a back experience that I've we have a lot of experience with virtual assistants there and you're really helping them tremendously that is that is a country that really benefits from from this exact sort of opportunity and I have one her her name is Janika she is my right hand woman and she helps me in business she also wakes me up every morning at 6 a.m and she calls me now it's not 6 a.m. her time of course it's like 6 p.m. so it's no big deal for her and she doesn't it's not like I'm this lazy American who's like I have to have somebody wake me up no I set my alarm for 555 so that she doesn't actually have to call me at 6 but just in case I sleep through it and I don't send her that message at 555 then she at 6 a.m. she will you know click on WhatsApp give me a quick call it's time to wake up now in the two years she's been doing this for me she's only ever had to call me once or twice and the rest is like I'm just too embarrassed so I immediately wake up I go Jenna guy I'm up I'm up but this was something I needed because I struggled to get up in the morning and it you know it's it you can have virtual assistance help with this now takes her all of 15 seconds to just you know call me or whatever it's like no big deal to her she's getting paid for it and I have her helping me schedule plan dates with my with my partner with the girlfriend she's saying here's all the cool things going on in Chicago this weekend what do you want to do dinner reservations and things like that too so you know virtual assistants are so helpful because you know I don't want to spend it's not that I don't want to find cool things to do with my girlfriend I do I just don't want to search for all the cool things I want all the cool things to come to me and then I just filter through those top 30 like or in your case the scripts you're getting for your social media content right you want that brought to you and then you can make those decisions much more quickly and then also that accountability piece is so important is having you give me a due date make sure I'm doing it and we all need accountability too I love this but it really is this thing that if if you're listening and you're like thinking I don't know how to give up that control then work on that because you will benefit so much by not digging your your claws into every part of your business and trying to hold on to everything and do it yourself you're just not going to be able to this is the bottom line and we also know that multitasking it's been well proven it does not work nobody can do it virtually nobody is good at multitasking and real estate agents are all having to multitask all day long because that's just the nature of the job so virtual assistants can help you do that and what I love about Kura is that you have specialized people for different tasks because this is a problem for people when they start looking at virtual assistants a lot of times they'll go on up work they'll submit you know to try to find someone and then they get 100 resumes and they're like gosh I don't know who to choose I don't know you know they can look at reviews and that's good but can this person do everything like you said could they do social media and admin tasks probably not well if they could do admin tasks they probably can't do social media but the reverse maybe works so you really need somebody who's got a team in place specific to real estate stuff and that's what you've built and so I mean we're talking about also what I what I love is I'm assuming your virtual assistants can also do things like you get a client and then they can start to create a calendar you know if you're all the important dates and they can reach out to you and say today's the day you need to call so and so and let them know it's 45 days before closing or whatever exactly they could do all that so yet did you build a lot of those systems and then train the staff on them or are you having where are you picking up some of these systems we're picking up I mean we put a lot of we create systems and videos we record them we then have them go through about a month onboarding process and then they will start working with the real estate agents so there's also we launched a cura academy which is partnered with like another company that essentially they can take continual education for free to level them up so we believe that they should continue to learn and progress through their career either with us or somewhere else I want them to continue to learn and also having like we have monthly jam sessions where we have one of like for example we had his name's A.C. He was working for an agent in Nashville and we heard about this amazing document that he created Excel document where he plugs all the information in from all of homes.com all the different websites right and then it essentially creates an email he takes that email and the listing age it looks at it and then sends it out for his listing report every week to his sellers so it's just like stuff like that it gets better and better and better over time because we're only working with real estate agents and our VA's are all it's like a round table of talking and if like they don't know the answer they'll go to one of the other 32 and if the 32 don't know it and my VA doesn't know it and I don't know it then it probably doesn't exist possibly or we do some research on it we figured out. I always think too that CRM's are often neglected and not not so much in the daily activities that people use them and know what they need to do day to day but in updating the data for the client and a virtual assistant is like the perfect person to be able to call every single person in your CRM or past clients and say hey I just want to make sure we have your birthday correct in here I just want to make sure we have XYZ data in here even if you want to know somebody's wedding anniversary or whatever information you want maybe their kids ages or birthdays you know you could have that person call on behalf of you and say well you know we're updating your data we want to celebrate your birthday every year we don't have it what is it when is your birthday and that's a touch point DJ yes that's a touch point because they saw that your team reached out and actually cared about them and then they remember you right and that's that's where a lot of agents are missing or missing it you know that too so it's kind of crazy so it's just small little touches like that just takes it to the next level yeah let's talk about so if I'm so if I'm so I'm an agent I've now thought about some tasks that I do for example I some some agents are really great at every day on Facebook they see the list of happy birthdays or the birthday you know or the you know the tunnel LinkedIn as well and then they start sending messages to people however they want to do that but that takes takes time it's a fairly repetitive task and something that probably could be automated or at least delegated rather not automated delegated to a virtual assistant so even things like that could be you know super helpful totally I mean transaction coordination chief of staff client concierge lead follow up I mean there's so many things that you can delegate away it's wild like the one where that you have your VA calling I'm like holy cow I should probably implement that because I always hit snooze so at like six a.m. you're earlier than me well it's what's funny is the yeah that's helpful for me but one thing that's really helpful for my relationship is she she will say okay you have to plan not my my girlfriend but my virtual assistant I've told her make sure I plan at least one date every single week and you know by Wednesday I have to have the date planned because if I don't then you know it's going to be really hard to get it done in time for the weekend so yeah so we have a we have a process for even things like that because and another thing she's done is even people in my personal life who I want to make sure I stay connected to it and again you can translate this over to business is she makes sure that I'm calling my friends every so often I want to make sure I'm staying in touch with so and so every 90 days you know just to you know for my own personal but again business stuff yeah this is this is all things that virtual assistants can absolutely do and keep you productive so if somebody wanted to explore Kura what's the process how did they get involved? so you go to work with Kura.com you'd fill out the form then we have an initial consultation okay and then you would have an interview with the VA's and then from there we would have a weekly call with you every single month after that free of charge and then a monthly call after that as well so that's what you're occurring to just to make sure we value the feedback of the agents to hear about like what's going right what's going wrong what are you creating with the VA's and just almost like a mastermind group of content and we're just to pump it out as much as we can if we find something that's valuable we'll send out to all the agents as well so oh that's really cool too yeah some extra like hey so and so in a different total part of the oh I love that it's it's a group thing kind of it's like a group thing yep yep yep mastermind yep it's a mastermind yeah it's for you people are like people are blown away they're like how are you not charging like for at least extra things and I'm like we shouldn't we should make this is but is the best possible version it can be and it as simple as possible right and that's what's special about it so I think that's why it's been growing so fast that's amazing and you can choose the number of hours I'm sure you have packages you have yeah it's all in the web it's all in the website you know exactly what the prices are going to be you know exactly how it works and then one of us will get in contact with with you as well so what if you estimated because you're a data guy what would you estimate your ROI is on a virtual assistant not not as an owner of Kura but just as an agent yourself well for me I mean it was 4x last year I mean I mean I I brought in I think I spent like $10,000 last year and I brought in about 40,000 on and it was specifically though like I could tie it it was emails outbound bulk emails the agents saw them they emailed me back said hey have a client I saw your email a couple months prior because they don't delete their emails right they're in the bucks so they searched they searched Chicago because we send four emails a year about cool things about the city we love like the best tropical restaurants stuff that's really out there right marketing right and and then I also bonus my VA as well because you did this work you should be incentivized as well just like me so but then I hear stories like in Houston where she got three listings for like four million dollars from calling just calling past clients just saying hey we're checking in how are you doing oh hey could you come by I want to possibly sell my house I didn't even know that till today she her name's Alicia she told me this I was like wow that's that's incredible so the ROI I mean it's endless on it if you get one deal it pretty much pays for a VA right one deal pays for a VA a part-time VA so I mean if you can't get one deal a year because of the the systems you're having them do you need to look at the systems and say is this going to give me an ROI and then if it's not cut it so yeah it's it's really really smart we were talking about his efficiency and and and effectiveness too and you and you're also leveling up your VA's you know you're not just they're not just staying at their current skill level you you have an academy where they're learning new skills I imagine you're you're pushing them hard with AI right now I would imagine that is a big thing because they can do so much more with AI than then we'll be able to do because they'll they'll be able to interface with it more often yeah totally and like if you look at it I tell everyone to get Chatchee Bt pro or whatever maybe complexity whatever maybe use it for a few weeks by yourself then give your VA your login and now they are speaking and they sound like your brand all the agents want to say I want to be on brand I want to be on brand well now they can speak like you like my my I always say let's go in everything Chatchee Bt now says let's go all the time it's like super positive about going it is me right and now my VA is me but in the Philippines so it's kind of crazy it is crazy that's really interesting so you've trained Chatchee Bt on your particular personality and your your mannerisms and your your style your aesthetic yeah and the way that you communicate and yeah I've done the same thing I I talk to Chatchee Bt all all day long or neem and not all day long but certainly I love being able to talk to it and have conversations and it again it starts to change the way it reflects back to me based on you know what it knows about me and then giving them the VA the login is really smart because then now it is speaking in your voice yes oh wow I never would have thought to do that that is because that is you just solved a major problem because we think about this a lot we say okay I'm going to hire a virtual assistant but they they live in a different country they don't maybe understand my culture or our culture we just have different backgrounds different histories and they have different values and of course they do different ways of being marketed to even you know different fonts appeal to different people in different cultures things like that different collars it's all different and we can't expect somebody who lives in a different country to know all of the ways in which Americans are you know what light up Americans but Chatchee Bt knows what lights you up and you know what lights up your your audience and so now it's speaking in that language and they don't have to try to figure it out Chatchee Bt will help them with that with that messaging that is really smart yeah I mean it's the biggest thing I've heard from agencies I want to be on brand I want to be on brand yeah this is how you be on brand like it knows your voice and some teams or some some agents will have multiple agents and I'm like and they're using the same VA I'm like give them logins for both so now they have the voice of both of you right so and that and I give them I would even give my agents if they ever needed to do anything for me I would give them my log in and they can use it and it speaks like me so silver time well I am excited I'm waiting for the just to go off script a moment I'm waiting for the day that AI and I don't know when that's coming if it's coming but I hope it is where it thinks of an idea for me on its own and says hey DJ I was just thinking about this I got an idea for you wow I'm waiting for that I'm we may we may be going away no it's going to be there I mean look at what happened with with the iPhone today the new update yeah it's you can now I could have an air pod in my in my ear and you could be speaking Spanish you'll be reading it will be translated into my ear are you kidding me I've just ordered the new air pod three they come out well they're not shipped they're not shipping yet they're shipping I think middle of next month I think or the end of this month so yeah I've ordered it I'm excited to test that out I had a guy at my my place yesterday who was a handy man he was plumber fixing something and he was Ukrainian and he really didn't speak English and we were speaking through Google translate which is pretty effective but it's you know I have to type it out and then I have to play it and then he has to hear it and you were going to be able to just you know do it through through the air pods now yeah yeah it's very very exciting I think the future is is really figuring out efficiency and and what's so great about this and I know you agree is that it allows the agent it feels overwhelming at first and it feels like a really stressful sort of thing to move things over to somebody else and put a lot of trust in faith and yeah maybe initially you're going to work a little harder to train them and get them up to speed and yeah there's going to be that discomfort there like there is whenever you try anything new and like I'm learning notion right now as a as a tool and it's bending my mind it's it's really I'm having a hard time grasping it but I'm right on the precipice of figuring out why this can completely organize my life and probably I should have a VA who's an expert at notion as well help me with it and you know it's it's frustrating I'm like I'm I'm almost there but I know once I figure it out it's going to allow me to to do what I do best which is not organize my life because I'm not good at that and I need help with that so I think it's first like identifying what you're not good at but you know needs to get done like I'm not good at you calling my clients right that's a big one I'm not good at calling my past clients and checking in with them I I don't like doing that it's not something I'm good at okay there's a solution for that right we can figure that out and maybe you do have to make those calls maybe that is something you have to do but the chat chbt along with a virtual assistant can give you 25 reasons to call somebody and yep with with items of value right now so I love that that cura is this company that is really taking virtual assistants which let's let's face it virtual assistants can be they can have jobs in all sorts of different industries and it's tough on them they it's gotta be rough and I love that you're taking them and specifically plugging them straight into real estate so that's kind of their main focus along with in real estate as all sorts of spokes as well we've got working and and customer service and and just obviously operations and compliance and and all this stuff and you're training them you're making sure that that team knows real estate processes and efficiencies and optimizations and then I come to you and say great I don't have to train somebody I just want to find somebody you know I absolutely have to tweak a little bit I'm sure but somebody who's already got experience knows what they're doing and I trust you because you're in this business you know what works and I think this is just a really really great great product so for anyone out there who is not currently using a VA wants to explore how to 4x their you know their investment which again I don't think that's I don't think that's an outlier I think that's pretty reasonable I would say I probably have a similar experience I use a VA's a little bit differently than you do but I would say I've probably yeah had a similar ROI and I need to figure out how to measure that because I'd like to know exactly but I've been using VA's for years they have saved me in so many different ways and you know I think this is such a smart idea also we should mention that you know you do work with agents all over the country we are a market here that Chicago people don't always stay here in Chicago they go elsewhere a lot of times they go to Florida they go to Texas they go well really anywhere that's warmer especially in the wintertime and when they retire so you obviously want to continue making those relationships stronger with or new relationships
