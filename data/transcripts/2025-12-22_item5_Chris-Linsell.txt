============================================================

[00:00:00] Well, it's almost 2026 and the National Association of REALTORS are making some changes.
[00:00:06] And now, membership is not required.
[00:00:10] And it really begs the question, is NAR important or needed or necessary in 2026?

[00:01:27] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:30] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage, your team?
[00:01:34] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:39] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:41] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:43] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:48] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:54] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:59] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents.
[00:02:04] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:08] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:13] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:17] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:22] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:23] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:28] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:31] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:33] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:37] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:43] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:46] That's corded.io and now onto the show.

[00:05:19] But DJ, I'm here.
[00:05:22] I'm excited.
[00:05:23] I'm actually on the road right now.
[00:05:25] I'm in New York City.
[00:05:27] I can't get away.
[00:05:29] I can't end the year without a big trip.
[00:05:33] So I'm here to take care of some business here.
[00:05:36] Talk to some great folks.
[00:05:38] And I'm here to talk to you because I've got this thing brewing inside me.
[00:05:45] My own popular opinion.
[00:05:47] It's been kind of fermenting for a while and I don't have a way to get it out.
[00:05:54] I figured you'd be the perfect source for this.
[00:05:57] I feel glad.
[00:05:57] I feel glad.
[00:05:58] I'm sorry.
[00:05:58] What is it?
[00:05:59] My own popular opinion.
[00:06:01] And I'm sorry, everyone.
[00:06:03] It's just where I'm coming from here.
[00:06:06] I think 2026 could be the last year that we see the National Association of REALTORS,
[00:06:16] at least as we know it right now.
[00:06:18] I think 2026, this might be the sunset year of what we've all come to understand as
[00:06:24] the natural.
[00:06:24] But they just laid out this massive plan.
[00:06:26] I saw this plan.
[00:06:28] It's true.
[00:06:30] Everybody makes big plans.
[00:06:32] It's true.
[00:06:32] And I'm not saying that they're going to go away completely.
[00:06:35] I don't think this is the URL is going to be available at the end of the year or anything.
[00:06:44] But I think the writing is on the wall.
[00:06:47] The influence and place in the industry for the National Association of REALTORS.
[00:06:53] We are approaching a decision point.
[00:06:56] And a lot has happened this year to kind of point us in that direction.
[00:06:59] But yeah, I think that's my bold assertion right now.
[00:07:03] The NAR.
[00:07:04] This might not be what you recognize a year from now.
[00:07:08] Yeah.
[00:07:08] The way I live in Chicago where NAR is headquartered, I go to that building often, although I'm not
[00:07:15] on the NAR floors.
[00:07:16] So I really don't have access to them.
[00:07:18] But I do have access maybe more so than other people who don't live here in Chicago.
[00:07:24] And I do get to speak to NAR people occasionally.
[00:07:27] And what I've gathered and what I think their most important function is from my perspective.
[00:07:34] And again, just my perspective.
[00:07:36] And I think it is really important is the sort of the Washington connection.
[00:07:42] They need to be there to protect the jobs of agents
[00:07:46] because technology is coming in.
[00:07:49] Technology moves faster than humans be human, the human part of this job.
[00:07:55] And technology is constantly threatening the livelihoods of REALTORS.
[00:08:00] I think people have felt that ever since 2001 perhaps.
[00:08:06] And what's really important is we have one point, whatever three, four million jobs here.
[00:08:12] And if NAR, if that was their sole focus in my opinion, we are here to protect your income.
[00:08:19] I think they would be strong.
[00:08:22] I think that it's any derivation from that I think is not that important to me.
[00:08:29] Because all I care about at the end of the day is we have hundreds and hundreds of
[00:08:32] REALTORS at our firm.
[00:08:34] I'm out of a job if they're out of a job.
[00:08:36] So if that becomes their sole focus, that's really all I care about.
[00:08:41] I don't know what's what's a you.
[00:08:43] I mean, I think that that makes sense.
[00:08:47] However, that doesn't that doesn't wash for me in terms of what the reality of both our
[00:08:56] political climate and the reality of this business is.
[00:09:01] I mean, here's the bottom line for me is no matter who you support what side of the
[00:09:07] aisle you're on politically.
[00:09:09] It's just objective observation, the current administration and the likely leadership in
[00:09:15] Washington has demonstrated that at least for the next couple of years until there is a big
[00:09:21] enough election to change things that they are bearish on regulation of technology, especially
[00:09:32] technology that is developing right now AI technology robotics technology big data technology.
[00:09:41] This is the technology that will affect the real estate industry and.
[00:09:45] And they're all in on it.
[00:09:46] They're all exactly over and over the current executive administration and the congressional
[00:09:53] body has demonstrated a not just a lack of interest, but a lack of willingness to act on
[00:10:01] any sort of regulation on broad swaths of industries, including real estate and housing.
[00:10:09] So I think if you couch the NAR's primary purpose as a lobbying body, I think that there is
[00:10:18] stuff that can be done for lobbying and advocacy, but protection of our jobs against forces
[00:10:25] like technology is an unrealistic expectation.
[00:10:29] Yeah, you're right.
[00:10:30] I also think that and this is important to recognize I also would willing I'd be
[00:10:37] willing to bet that the average member of the National Association of REALTORS has zero clue
[00:10:43] that that is something that this body does that they have absolutely no idea of the role and
[00:10:53] responsibility of the NAR as a lobbying and and interest group on behalf of real estate professionals.
[00:11:04] And that's not to say that the work that they're not that they're doing is important in that
[00:11:09] realm. I think it is important in that realm, but they have told a terrible story in terms of
[00:11:16] being able to communicate that value to their members. And this is I think a symptom of one of
[00:11:23] the reasons why I am very skeptical that the NAR will look and function the same way that it does
[00:11:29] right now, a year from now. I think that there is a massive disconnect between the understanding of
[00:11:38] the NAR's value amongst its members and what it actually does. And this is going to result in a
[00:11:45] significant attrition of membership, especially given the fact that in November, NAR approved a
[00:11:54] motion that says that you don't need to be a member of the NAR to get access to your local association.
[00:12:00] Now, local association can require that on their own independently, but local associations would be
[00:12:05] insane if this stayed the same because members have been asking demanding this. The NAR has now
[00:12:15] granted this. I bet the membership numbers of the NAR in 2026, this could touch a negative
[00:12:24] a negative growth rate. I think it could touch double digits. If we see that, this this body
[00:12:31] has changed forever. I don't know if we will, but my perspective on this is is members do not have
[00:12:38] any idea of what the value that this organization is providing them. They're not clear. I'm unclear.
[00:12:44] What what they do. And I pay a little bit of attention, but to to that, if we keep going to this
[00:12:52] logical end conclusion, it doesn't stop with NAR. Now we're talking about what's the value of
[00:12:57] the state association. What's the value of the local association and here in Chicago, and I don't
[00:13:02] know if this is nationwide, although I suspect it probably will be, we now and this is the buzz
[00:13:09] that's happening here is local associations, which are really the gatekeepers to the MLS for
[00:13:15] here in our local market. They are now decoupling just like commissions and you can actually purchase
[00:13:21] directly access to MLS without becoming a member of the local and state and also national association.
[00:13:29] So they everybody's now having to, you know, sort of apply for their jobs again. And I am,
[00:13:37] I am going to be very, and I'm somebody who volunteers at the local association. I like our association.
[00:13:42] I think we do a lot of wonderful things. And I'm curious on how, but we also know that most agents
[00:13:48] don't take advantage of the resources that are provided. We just really, it's kind of an MLS fee
[00:13:52] if we think about it for most of us. And if we're not utilizing those resources on the NAR side,
[00:13:58] state, or local, why should I pay a thousand bucks a year when I can just buy the MLS directly
[00:14:05] for 500? You know, I don't know. Yeah, you know, I it's interesting to listen to you talk about the
[00:14:11] the how the the cascading effect of loss of confidence in the NAR would take. I agree. I think
[00:14:21] absolutely state associations will be under fire if this move starts to happen at the NAR.
[00:14:28] I don't actually have the same concern that you do about local association
[00:14:33] of support changing because in the same way that government works. There's a lot of
[00:14:44] immediately accessible value that you can understand from the from the the work of a local
[00:14:51] association and a local government from a local association. You just got to these are the
[00:14:57] folks that literally keep the MLS running. And so you recognize these are people whose work is
[00:15:04] directly benefiting what you're trying to do. These are also the people that are enforcing
[00:15:12] the rules. Yeah, the rules. And directly, these are folks that you will see in the hallways.
[00:15:20] These are folks who will call you before a disciplinary board or will be the ones listening
[00:15:27] to your complaints if you have them or mediating between exactly. Yeah, they're there to protect you
[00:15:34] for sure. And so there is like an immediate connection of the value that folks on the local level
[00:15:39] provide to professionals. That that connection is one level removed at the state. It's two levels
[00:15:46] removed may be higher at the national level. And so there is to some degree some protection
[00:15:52] for local folks. But I love the way that you phrased that that everybody is kind of interviewing for
[00:15:58] their job again. And to some degree, I actually think that's an ironic and poignant choice of words
[00:16:08] because we are also in a time in the industry where a lot of real estate professionals are having to
[00:16:19] I mean de facto interview for their jobs again because consumers either directly or kind of
[00:16:27] implicitly are asking of professionals. Is there something that you can do for me that chat GPT
[00:16:35] can't do for me? Is there something that you personally can provide to me whether it's insight
[00:16:43] or experience or perspective that I can't get from Gemini or from Claude? If the answer is only
[00:16:53] I have access to the forms or I have access to the MLS that is not going to be a hurdle for if it's
[00:17:03] if it is at all, it won't be a hurdle for very long at all. Consumers wise up to that for sure.
[00:17:11] We'll plow it out and there are I was just reading in in in men the other week there are
[00:17:18] peer-to-peer real estate transaction platforms that are getting funded by venture capital at
[00:17:26] amazing rates right now such that there are builders and company founders that are recognizing
[00:17:35] this is not the peer-to-peer system is not appropriate for all transactions but if there are instances
[00:17:43] where the value that a real estate professional can that provides stops at the water's edge of
[00:17:50] Lake Chat GPT those are not transactions that require professionals at least in this current context
[00:17:58] and so there are technology solutions being developed for that exact moment and that is going to be
[00:18:06] a huge chunk and I say huge I mean like easily double digits if not more of our industry are
[00:18:14] real estate professionals who are simply servicing access to data and forms those people are
[00:18:23] going to be out of here and you can imagine a world where the NARs where the NAR was being
[00:18:31] incredibly aggressive in technology training in job skill leveling up in transforming their membership
[00:18:42] into a 21st century workforce that could absolutely revolutionize the way that we think about and
[00:18:52] manage this industry and I read a lot about what's happening in this space I gotta say I don't hear
[00:19:01] a lot coming out of the NAR on this ground I would love to but I just don't think it's in the
[00:19:08] cards and I don't think that they have the consumer confidence to inspire a lot of attention
[00:19:13] if they were to make that right turn yeah you're right so the idea of you know having them as
[00:19:20] a lobbying organization obviously important in some fashion but maybe more important and I
[00:19:26] I agree with you and didn't think about this was leveling up skills if if we could help us level
[00:19:32] up our skills at to at the very least the interpersonal skills the stuff that chat GPT can't solve for
[00:19:39] yet and hopefully never the the emotional connections the you know whatever people the person to
[00:19:48] person stuff that goes into this job that you know people can work on and develop and the experience
[00:19:56] how do I become so important that I know information about my local market that it's just
[00:20:03] chat GPT just wouldn't be able to know because I'm so tied into the community is community I know the
[00:20:10] people I know the players I know who makes things happen that's the stuff that that people are
[00:20:15] going to need and chat GPT will solve for everything else I mean it's already solved for
[00:20:19] solved for most everything else yeah now I will say for what it's worth I have a vision of like
[00:20:27] if I if I was re if I was rebuilding NAR like if I got to push the pause button and I got to rebuild
[00:20:35] NAR into exactly what I would want for a national trade association because let's remember this
[00:20:44] is a trade association the NAR is not a governmental regulator right it can't enforce laws it is
[00:20:54] not a consumer protection agency it doesn't advocacy advocate for consumers at all it's not a
[00:21:01] neutral market referee at all it's not a housing affordability advocacy group at all it's none of those
[00:21:09] things which is okay I mean some of this stuff it has never really claimed to be it's just kind of
[00:21:16] not dispel the myth and rumor that it is these things but if I was pushing pause on time right now
[00:21:23] and I got to rebuild the NAR exactly and as I think it could be the most effective and efficient
[00:21:30] there are four big things that I would have it focus on number one you nailed it before it would be
[00:21:35] a lobbying group it would be the most incredible advocacy for our industry in Washington and in
[00:21:43] the local state houses that we've ever seen and it's already doing that to some degree most people
[00:21:49] don't know about it so we would continue doing what we're doing right now but we would get somebody
[00:21:54] into that marketing and comm's office that could tell that story better than some bland blog posts
[00:22:01] and press releases that nobody reads that would be the first thing the second thing is I would turn it
[00:22:07] into this absolute data powerhouse we already do this it already does this to some degree but we
[00:22:15] would need to multiply it times 10 real estate has incredible data in it think about all of the data
[00:22:22] that gets listed when you list a property per sale on my MLS it's like 300 fields that need to get
[00:22:28] thrilled in imagine if the NAR committed to being 10x data collection insights and analysis
[00:22:40] we could easily do this we could do 100x frankly based on the power that AI unlocks in terms of
[00:22:47] big data analysis and understanding of what that meta analysis will drive for us that'd be the
[00:22:54] second thing and the only way to really unlock the second thing would be the third thing and this is
[00:22:58] where I'm going to get in trouble with somebody I'm sure I would love it if the NAR would say
[00:23:03] guys it's time it's time for a national MLS yeah and all the MLS is and put them into one unified
[00:23:12] system that is still locally administrative by local boards but we have one unified system that
[00:23:20] gets you access to every listing in the country so that you can take full advantage of that data
[00:23:27] that we were just talking about you can do comparisons yeah CMA's CMA's would get
[00:23:34] 100 a thousand times more accurate how could you imagine it would be amazing if you could start to
[00:23:40] compare like properties in similar markets across the united states your CMA's would get insanely
[00:23:49] accurate and it would be better for the consumers well here's a use case so you have a couple that
[00:23:55] is mirroring retirement and wants to live somewhere warm and isn't particularly tied into a certain
[00:24:01] state or city community their friends are all over the place so they can kind of go they have four
[00:24:07] different options this is where this this data could be super useful as an agent here in not
[00:24:13] those markets you could say hey I've done this research for you with AI and with all of the NAR
[00:24:19] data and we've run some comps and here's where you're going to get your best bang for your buck
[00:24:22] and you could have that conversation here before heading down and but I mean that would be amazing
[00:24:31] so then number four it would be amazing by the way it would be incredible NAR if you're listening to
[00:24:38] this think about it this would be a great idea I know that there's a lot that goes into this sort
[00:24:43] of thing and it's easy for me to talk about it on a podcast because I don't actually have to build
[00:24:47] the systems but this is the future of what we're looking for the fourth one and again I know this
[00:24:56] is not exactly what I would I know I'm going to get flacked from somebody on this but hear me out
[00:25:03] on this number four is this needs to be the body that regulates not just the enforcement of the
[00:25:15] code of ethics but this needs to be the body that partners with state and federal administrations
[00:25:23] to regulate and create a higher barrier to entry to getting a real estate license yeah
[00:25:33] this is not unprecedented you cannot become a lawyer or a doctor without passing the bar exam
[00:25:42] without taking your medical boards you cannot become an accountant without both passing state and
[00:25:51] federal tests as well as partnered trade tests yeah there should be an NAR standard in order to
[00:26:00] get admittance to the National Association of REALTORS and be able to practice and get access
[00:26:05] to the local MLS the barrier to entry to our industry has to be a little bit higher because
[00:26:14] this will prevent a flood of inexperienced and unserious professionals into the space frankly we've
[00:26:24] experienced that for a hundred years now because the barrier to entry into the space is so low if
[00:26:30] we formalized the entry into this just two steps higher than what it is right now and by getting
[00:26:38] passing that just a little bit higher bar you get amazing access to national data to this
[00:26:49] now higher higher regarded group of professionals because everybody in this group is here to play
[00:26:57] we're not just here to stand around and look at our stared our shoes the entire industry would
[00:27:03] benefit from this I would even advocate and again don't come at me on actually can come at me
[00:27:08] I don't care existing agents if this was something that at the NAR took on existing agents should
[00:27:14] have to retest in order to get into this new and improved system the long and short of it is
[00:27:21] the NARs the NAR took a real punch in the gut back and I think it was March of last year when
[00:27:32] the when the lawsuit settlement was issued $408 million I think in a cash penalty a whole bunch
[00:27:41] of regulatory I say regulatory they're not regulatory they're not regulations by the government
[00:27:46] just trade group policies that had to change and the real estate industry took it on the
[00:27:53] chin in the mass media for about three months here but the reality is things really haven't
[00:28:01] changed that much as in terms of the day-to-day operations of most real estate professionals
[00:28:07] which means to me or that what that says here is that the NAR is the face and the mouthpiece for an
[00:28:17] industry but the rest of us that are actually operating the industry and we don't actually
[00:28:25] believe that we don't think the NAR is representative of who we are and what we do we don't think
[00:28:29] of what they say is representative of what we say and what we think and so the NAR took this
[00:28:35] big punch in the gut in terms of the the penalty and all of the stuff that came along with it
[00:28:41] but most agents they just had to tolerate the news that came along with it and that was about it
[00:28:46] because I think you and I were talking before the show kicked off we all expected to see
[00:28:52] commission rates compress as a result of these lawsuits they have actually on average inflated
[00:28:59] you make more than you did pre-law suit settlement on average in the United States by like a
[00:29:06] tenth of a point which is a lot if you consider what you know what the typical you know a gross
[00:29:13] commission income is in the United States so I mean it's time the NAR and I think the right
[00:29:19] the writing isn't just on the wall it's starting we're starting to see this this happen this
[00:29:24] perception changing I don't I don't think we're going to see the same body in December 2026 as we
[00:29:30] see right now you brought up a good point about leveling up with our accreditation or just our
[00:29:37] skills and NAR being really it really should be their main focus it that really is part and parcel
[00:29:46] with going to Washington and saying we want to protect these jobs here's what we're doing so that
[00:29:52] Washington would hopefully look favorably on helping protect our jobs because if NAR could say here's
[00:30:00] what we're demanding of our members and we're we're doing now is you know the biggest challenge I've
[00:30:07] see in the you know getting getting into this business is just passing local or state and federal
[00:30:13] exams which are mostly based on memorization of facts and data and not necessarily use case like not
[00:30:21] necessarily like going out in the real world how do I actually apply the code of ethics what do I do
[00:30:27] in scenario a scenario b what should I do because ultimately that's what's most important is how
[00:30:33] are my applying the code of ethics to my business and there is very little information and and
[00:30:41] testing on that and it that needs to be the most important part of being a REALTOR because that's
[00:30:47] what the rubber meets the road like you were actually working with clients and you need to know if
[00:30:51] another REALTOR calls you and asks you this question you need to know what am I allowed to say in
[00:30:57] return and what am I not allowed to say how do I not violate fair housing when xyz question comes in
[00:31:03] you know there these are things that that they could focus on and people would have a better
[00:31:09] buying or selling experience consumers would would benefit the agent would benefit because they
[00:31:15] would know more and the whole industry would improve but it would have to be something that is
[00:31:21] probably demanded by at the federal or sorry at the at the national level of of the trade organization
[00:31:28] and say guys time to level up and we're going to provide all the training we're going to tell you
[00:31:32] exactly what to do and they can do that I don't know this isn't hard they can build these tools
[00:31:39] and they can train us and REALTORS will do it they will absolutely want to level up their skills
[00:31:46] and the ones that won't will self-select out and fine we don't want them anyway so yeah I'm with
[00:31:52] you I think that would be an amazing thing for n-a-r to take on yeah and and to your point like
[00:32:00] the the test test you have to pass for the bar exam medical boards all of these things
[00:32:08] include exactly what you described oh I know yeah real world scenarios and I mean truthfully you
[00:32:17] know the you know what I remember the most and this is a lot of years ago now so you know bear
[00:32:22] with me on this but you know what I remember the most from the real estate license exam in Michigan
[00:32:29] having to memorize how many square feet were in an acre and it's 4,600 or 560 excuse me
[00:32:37] I remember that because I knew I like it just did the math on the test I'm like okay all of these
[00:32:43] questions are worth the same I have to get like 60 questions right in order to pass this exam
[00:32:52] if I can I know that this will be on there so I spent an inordinate amount of time memorizing
[00:32:58] how many square feet were in an acre that has literally never come up once in my entire and you
[00:33:06] know what if it did come up I got a phone that could tell me these things I don't need to know that
[00:33:11] I'm not going to be googling the you know the things that will happen in the real world I'll actually
[00:33:19] just be navigating these things with my experience here here in Illinois if you are a stylist you
[00:33:26] must do and this is amazing we we don't often think about and please forgive anyone who is in this
[00:33:36] field I have so much respect for you I love my my the person that cuts my hair I think she's
[00:33:42] unbelievable but we don't often think of that as a super highly skilled job it's just somebody
[00:33:47] who's good at cutting hair but the reality is they have to do 1500 hours of of literal like
[00:33:55] apprenticeship before they can even practice that's after passing the test 1500 hours like we don't
[00:34:03] have any hours you have to do other than a couple of tests and maybe some post licensing stuff but
[00:34:09] I'm not saying we need at 1500 hours but like the reason why they do that is because you know they
[00:34:14] could they could hurt you there could be a medical issue if they cut you with scissors and yeah they
[00:34:19] feel like that is pretty important they're cutting around your brain like it's it's significant
[00:34:23] a significant part of the human body we need to make sure these people know exactly what they're
[00:34:27] doing even though we just think of them as they just cut hair no they are really really really skilled
[00:34:32] even though we don't give them the credit this is what we could bring to some version of this in
[00:34:38] to because we're dealing with somebody's in many cases their largest financial transaction
[00:34:43] this is as important as getting your haircut by somebody that's not going to poke your brain with
[00:34:48] their scissors like you have to know what to do and we're we push it off to brokerages like brokerages
[00:34:55] you're the ones who are going to really teach how to do this stuff and it's like that's not
[00:35:01] and because now you don't have any standard now there's no standard of practice and so that that's
[00:35:07] what I think I agree with you I think we could we could really push any art to deliver more there
[00:35:14] well to to your point I think you know my kind of final position on this as we wrap up is
[00:35:22] the reality is I think NAR is I'm pretty I feel pretty confident frankly that the NAR is going to
[00:35:30] start to change quickly in terms of its complexion I don't have super high expectations that my
[00:35:37] dream scenario will be fulfilled here so what does that mean for most agents it means that all of
[00:35:46] the benefits like the express benefits that we just talked through these are not industry standards
[00:35:52] or options which means that if you can find a way to create that value in your own business you have
[00:35:59] immediate advantage over all of your competitors like we do not have what I would consider to be
[00:36:07] anywhere close to a mature data analysis engine when it comes to the real estate industry like there
[00:36:16] are some third-party platforms that will do it for you but nothing that your local board or your
[00:36:22] state association or your national association like the the the level of detail granularity
[00:36:31] and how often you get data reports and how usable they are relative to your consumers
[00:36:38] we are 100 steps behind where we could be right now but the good news is you have access to that
[00:36:45] data via the MLS you can do this sort of analysis and be the smartest guy or gal in the room
[00:36:52] just by virtue of asking the right questions and having the data said to use AI in order to
[00:37:00] unanalys and draw the answer from you have that option everybody does but very few people are going
[00:37:07] to do it you can do this though and you know by default your competitors are not doing it so take
[00:37:14] advantage of the things that any of us should be doing and just do them for yourself level up your
[00:37:19] skill set with the sort of post-professional training that will give you an advantage that you can
[00:37:24] brag about later on do the things about advocacy you don't have to go to Washington to do this show up
[00:37:32] at your local zoning boards show up at school board committees show up at town council meetings wherever
[00:37:39] the sorts of decisions are being made on a local level show up listen provide your perspective
[00:37:45] in opinion you have the option of doing these things yourself if the NAR won't do them for you
[00:37:51] and by default your competitors won't do these things so if you do them you're immediately the smartest
[00:37:58] person in the room that's it it's easy it is it is a sacrifice of time and that's a decision that
[00:38:04] has to be made but we're not asking you I know I am not asking I don't think that this is at all a
[00:38:12] a sacrifice beyond what would be reasonably considered an ambitious professional and if you're
[00:38:21] not an ambitious professional then this isn't for you but if you are this is stuff that you can do
[00:38:25] right now if I was a practicing agent what I would be doing right now is I would be getting an
[00:38:31] API feed from my MLS I'd pay for that which is very reasonable I don't know you sometimes you see
[00:38:38] these API feeds as low as the IDX feed rather via API is usually I don't know 20 bucks a month maybe
[00:38:46] a hundred bucks a month at most somewhere in that neighborhood so you get that data feed you can
[00:38:51] have the your local MLS whatever the the data provider is that we'll sign off on that it's your
[00:38:58] data you have access to it you pay for this this access you can connect that to an AI engine whether
[00:39:04] it's Claude or or open AI or Gemini or whoever or make through through Zapier or make dot com you can
[00:39:11] connect these these data points to this data together and now you can have AI do what you exactly
[00:39:18] what you were saying is now start interpreting data in my local market give me the data that is
[00:39:23] going to help me service my clients more effectively and it will build it for you like you can
[00:39:29] literally have that data stored somewhere and then consistently update it and ask AI to pull out
[00:39:34] the most relevant information now you have to make sure the AI is getting you doing the doing the
[00:39:39] calculations correctly and that's a whole other thing but it will at least get you on the on the
[00:39:43] right track so you're right you don't have to wait for NAR or or another tool to be built you can
[00:39:48] now build these tools yourself and that's what I would be doing I mean we've done this ourselves with
[00:39:53] our brokerage we just now have a have a data feed straight to the MLS and we're building our own tools
[00:39:59] to figure out exactly what we need for our agents I mean it is the opportunity is now the opportunity
[00:40:06] is now and this is you know frankly I think most people will hear this you know kind of mid to late
[00:40:15] December you've got some time right now if you're listening to this mid to late December you are
[00:40:23] probably not working as much as you would be a month from now it takes some time to just sit
[00:40:29] reflect drink an eggnog and think about what all Uncle Chris and DJ have been saying here and
[00:40:36] think about what your 2026 plans are going to be to create the to create velocity around these
[00:40:44] opportunities because whether you do or do not you're making the choice to to go in one direction or
[00:40:52] another so and I guarantee you both will be hard so just choose the hard that you want do you want
[00:40:58] the hard that is associated with innovation and pushing your business forward or do you want the
[00:41:03] hard associated with standing still and watching your competitors pace out in front of you
[00:41:09] the choice seems pretty straightforward I mean but up to you guys enjoy your holiday break
[00:41:14] think about what you need to do in order to make 2026 successful and don't take your foot off the
[00:41:21] gas because remember anything you're doing now is going to bear fruit 90 to 100 days from now 90 to
[00:41:27] 120 days so you know let's this is time to reconnect with clients with your your sphere and let them
[00:41:33] know that you're thinking about them give them something of value that maybe even if it's just a
[00:41:37] re a prezel of what you believe their property is worth two days even if it's just that which by
[00:41:42] the way AI can sort of do and maybe do a decent job of but you with your local experience might do
[00:41:49] a better job so those are things that you could deliver hand deliver to everybody in your sphere
[00:41:53] this this holiday and say hey I was thinking about you here's something I think would be a value to
[00:41:58] and then you can start now having conversations about future plans all right Chris linsell.com is where
[00:42:04] you go to learn about everything Chris and I did not know you were in New York actually so that is
[00:42:10] exciting I'm glad you there I'm jealous please go visit Katz's deli if you haven't already but
[00:42:16] it's my favorite favorite deli in New York as well it's everybody's favorite deli in New York but
[00:42:21] yeah that's one of my favorite places and yeah on behalf of all of our audience thank you

And now, onto our show. Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage, your team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io and now onto the show. And welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide and host through the show today is our monthly series that we've been doing for years. It's our last one of 2025 called unpopular real estate opinions with the smartest guy in the room. Chris, Lynn, sell and let me tell you about Chris in case you're new to the show. By the way, if you are new, welcome. If you're a returning listener, welcome back. We appreciate you. But let me tell you about Chris in case you don't know him.

He specializes in new solutions to old questions, constantly exploring the cutting edge of technology in the real estate space. He is many, many years of experience as a licensed REALTOR in the state of Michigan.

He speaks, I think every year for the last five or six years, maybe longer, at the NAR conference, along with many other local and regional conferences, if you are looking for somebody to tell you what's ahead in real estate and what's ahead, what's coming up for REALTORS. He is the guy to talk to and have speak at your events. ChrisLinsel.com is where you can find that. Chris, welcome back to the show. DJ, it's a pleasure to be here. Happy December.

So, you know, this is not Luxury Presence sponsored appearance, but if you're looking for technology to help power your business, we got a lot of cool stuff going on over there. So come on over, see us, Luxury Presence.com. But DJ, I'm here. I'm excited. I'm actually on the road right now. I'm in New York City. I can't get away. I can't end the year without a big trip. So I'm here to take care of some business here. Talk to some great folks. And I'm here to talk to you because I've got this thing brewing inside me. My own popular opinion. It's been kind of fermenting for a while and I don't have a way to get it out. I figured you'd be the perfect source for this. I feel glad. I feel glad. I'm sorry. What is it? My own popular opinion. And I'm sorry, everyone. It's just where I'm coming from here. I think 2026 could be the last year that we see the National Association of REALTORS, at least as we know it right now. I think 2026, this might be the sunset year of what we've all come to understand as the natural. But they just laid out this massive plan. I saw this plan. It's true. Everybody makes big plans. It's true. And I'm not saying that they're going to go away completely. I don't think this is the URL is going to be available at the end of the year or anything. But I think the writing is on the wall. The influence and place in the industry for the National Association of REALTORS. We are approaching a decision point. And a lot has happened this year to kind of point us in that direction. But yeah, I think that's my bold assertion right now. The NAR. This might not be what you recognize a year from now. Yeah. The way I live in Chicago where NAR is headquartered, I go to that building often, although I'm not on the NAR floors. So I really don't have access to them. But I do have access maybe more so than other people who don't live here in Chicago. And I do get to speak to NAR people occasionally. And what I've gathered and what I think their most important function is from my perspective. And again, just my perspective. And I think it is really important is the sort of the Washington connection. They need to be there to protect the jobs of agents because technology is coming in. Technology moves faster than humans be human, the human part of this job. And technology is constantly threatening the livelihoods of REALTORS. I think people have felt that ever since 2001 perhaps. And what's really important is we have one point, whatever three, four million jobs here. And if NAR, if that was their sole focus in my opinion, we are here to protect your income. I think they would be strong. I think that it's any derivation from that I think is not that important to me. Because all I care about at the end of the day is we have hundreds and hundreds of REALTORS at our firm. I'm out of a job if they're out of a job. So if that becomes their sole focus, that's really all I care about. I don't know what's what's a you. I mean, I think that that makes sense. However, that doesn't that doesn't wash for me in terms of what the reality of both our political climate and the reality of this business is. I mean, here's the bottom line for me is no matter who you support what side of the aisle you're on politically. It's just objective observation, the current administration and the likely leadership in Washington has demonstrated that at least for the next couple of years until there is a big enough election to change things that they are bearish on regulation of technology, especially technology that is developing right now AI technology robotics technology big data technology. This is the technology that will affect the real estate industry and. And they're all in on it. They're all exactly over and over the current executive administration and the congressional body has demonstrated a not just a lack of interest, but a lack of willingness to act on any sort of regulation on broad swaths of industries, including real estate and housing. So I think if you couch the NAR's primary purpose as a lobbying body, I think that there is stuff that can be done for lobbying and advocacy, but protection of our jobs against forces like technology is an unrealistic expectation. Yeah, you're right. I also think that and this is important to recognize I also would willing I'd be willing to bet that the average member of the National Association of REALTORS has zero clue that that is something that this body does that they have absolutely no idea of the role and responsibility of the NAR as a lobbying and and interest group on behalf of real estate professionals. And that's not to say that the work that they're not that they're doing is important in that realm. I think it is important in that realm, but they have told a terrible story in terms of being able to communicate that value to their members. And this is I think a symptom of one of the reasons why I am very skeptical that the NAR will look and function the same way that it does right now, a year from now. I think that there is a massive disconnect between the understanding of the NAR's value amongst its members and what it actually does. And this is going to result in a significant attrition of membership, especially given the fact that in November, NAR approved a motion that says that you don't need to be a member of the NAR to get access to your local association. Now, local association can require that on their own independently, but local associations would be insane if this stayed the same because members have been asking demanding this. The NAR has now granted this. I bet the membership numbers of the NAR in 2026, this could touch a negative a negative growth rate. I think it could touch double digits. If we see that, this this body has changed forever. I don't know if we will, but my perspective on this is is members do not have any idea of what the value that this organization is providing them. They're not clear. I'm unclear. What what they do. And I pay a little bit of attention, but to to that, if we keep going to this logical end conclusion, it doesn't stop with NAR. Now we're talking about what's the value of the state association. What's the value of the local association and here in Chicago, and I don't know if this is nationwide, although I suspect it probably will be, we now and this is the buzz that's happening here is local associations, which are really the gatekeepers to the MLS for here in our local market. They are now decoupling just like commissions and you can actually purchase directly access to MLS without becoming a member of the local and state and also national association. So they everybody's now having to, you know, sort of apply for their jobs again. And I am, I am going to be very, and I'm somebody who volunteers at the local association. I like our association. I think we do a lot of wonderful things. And I'm curious on how, but we also know that most agents don't take advantage of the resources that are provided. We just really, it's kind of an MLS fee if we think about it for most of us. And if we're not utilizing those resources on the NAR side, state, or local, why should I pay a thousand bucks a year when I can just buy the MLS directly for 500? You know, I don't know. Yeah, you know, I it's interesting to listen to you talk about the the how the the cascading effect of loss of confidence in the NAR would take. I agree. I think absolutely state associations will be under fire if this move starts to happen at the NAR. I don't actually have the same concern that you do about local association of support changing because in the same way that government works. There's a lot of immediately accessible value that you can understand from the from the the work of a local association and a local government from a local association. You just got to these are the folks that literally keep the MLS running. And so you recognize these are people whose work is directly benefiting what you're trying to do. These are also the people that are enforcing the rules. Yeah, the rules. And directly, these are folks that you will see in the hallways. These are folks who will call you before a disciplinary board or will be the ones listening to your complaints if you have them or mediating between exactly. Yeah, they're there to protect you for sure. And so there is like an immediate connection of the value that folks on the local level provide to professionals. That that connection is one level removed at the state. It's two levels removed may be higher at the national level. And so there is to some degree some protection for local folks. But I love the way that you phrased that that everybody is kind of interviewing for their job again. And to some degree, I actually think that's an ironic and poignant choice of words because we are also in a time in the industry where a lot of real estate professionals are having to I mean de facto interview for their jobs again because consumers either directly or kind of implicitly are asking of professionals. Is there something that you can do for me that chat GPT can't do for me? Is there something that you personally can provide to me whether it's insight or experience or perspective that I can't get from Gemini or from Claude? If the answer is only I have access to the forms or I have access to the MLS that is not going to be a hurdle for if it's if it is at all, it won't be a hurdle for very long at all. Consumers wise up to that for sure. We'll plow it out and there are I was just reading in in in men the other week there are peer-to-peer real estate transaction platforms that are getting funded by venture capital at amazing rates right now such that there are builders and company founders that are recognizing this is not the peer-to-peer system is not appropriate for all transactions but if there are instances where the value that a real estate professional can that provides stops at the water's edge of Lake Chat GPT those are not transactions that require professionals at least in this current context and so there are technology solutions being developed for that exact moment and that is going to be a huge chunk and I say huge I mean like easily double digits if not more of our industry are real estate professionals who are simply servicing access to data and forms those people are going to be out of here and you can imagine a world where the NARs where the NAR was being incredibly aggressive in technology training in job skill leveling up in transforming their membership into a 21st century workforce that could absolutely revolutionize the way that we think about and manage this industry and I read a lot about what's happening in this space I gotta say I don't hear a lot coming out of the NAR on this ground I would love to but I just don't think it's in the cards and I don't think that they have the consumer confidence to inspire a lot of attention if they were to make that right turn yeah you're right so the idea of you know having them as a lobbying organization obviously important in some fashion but maybe more important and I I agree with you and didn't think about this was leveling up skills if if we could help us level up our skills at to at the very least the interpersonal skills the stuff that chat GPT can't solve for yet and hopefully never the the emotional connections the you know whatever people the person to person stuff that goes into this job that you know people can work on and develop and the experience how do I become so important that I know information about my local market that it's just chat GPT just wouldn't be able to know because I'm so tied into the community is community I know the people I know the players I know who makes things happen that's the stuff that that people are going to need and chat GPT will solve for everything else I mean it's already solved for solved for most everything else yeah now I will say for what it's worth I have a vision of like if I if I was re if I was rebuilding NAR like if I got to push the pause button and I got to rebuild NAR into exactly what I would want for a national trade association because let's remember this is a trade association the NAR is not a governmental regulator right it can't enforce laws it is not a consumer protection agency it doesn't advocacy advocate for consumers at all it's not a neutral market referee at all it's not a housing affordability advocacy group at all it's none of those things which is okay I mean some of this stuff it has never really claimed to be it's just kind of not dispel the myth and rumor that it is these things but if I was pushing pause on time right now and I got to rebuild the NAR exactly and as I think it could be the most effective and efficient there are four big things that I would have it focus on number one you nailed it before it would be a lobbying group it would be the most incredible advocacy for our industry in Washington and in the local state houses that we've ever seen and it's already doing that to some degree most people don't know about it so we would continue doing what we're doing right now but we would get somebody into that marketing and comm's office that could tell that story better than some bland blog posts and press releases that nobody reads that would be the first thing the second thing is I would turn it into this absolute data powerhouse we already do this it already does this to some degree but we would need to multiply it times 10 real estate has incredible data in it think about all of the data that gets listed when you list a property per sale on my MLS it's like 300 fields that need to get thrilled in imagine if the NAR committed to being 10x data collection insights and analysis we could easily do this we could do 100x frankly based on the power that AI unlocks in terms of big data analysis and understanding of what that meta analysis will drive for us that'd be the second thing and the only way to really unlock the second thing would be the third thing and this is where I'm going to get in trouble with somebody I'm sure I would love it if the NAR would say guys it's time it's time for a national MLS yeah and all the MLS is and put them into one unified system that is still locally administrative by local boards but we have one unified system that gets you access to every listing in the country so that you can take full advantage of that data that we were just talking about you can do comparisons yeah CMA's CMA's would get 100 a thousand times more accurate how could you imagine it would be amazing if you could start to compare like properties in similar markets across the united states your CMA's would get insanely accurate and it would be better for the consumers well here's a use case so you have a couple that is mirroring retirement and wants to live somewhere warm and isn't particularly tied into a certain state or city community their friends are all over the place so they can kind of go they have four different options this is where this this data could be super useful as an agent here in not those markets you could say hey I've done this research for you with AI and with all of the NAR data and we've run some comps and here's where you're going to get your best bang for your buck and you could have that conversation here before heading down and but I mean that would be amazing so then number four it would be amazing by the way it would be incredible NAR if you're listening to this think about it this would be a great idea I know that there's a lot that goes into this sort of thing and it's easy for me to talk about it on a podcast because I don't actually have to build the systems but this is the future of what we're looking for the fourth one and again I know this is not exactly what I would I know I'm going to get flacked from somebody on this but hear me out on this number four is this needs to be the body that regulates not just the enforcement of the code of ethics but this needs to be the body that partners with state and federal administrations to regulate and create a higher barrier to entry to getting a real estate license yeah this is not unprecedented you cannot become a lawyer or a doctor without passing the bar exam without taking your medical boards you cannot become an accountant without both passing state and federal tests as well as partnered trade tests yeah there should be an NAR standard in order to get admittance to the National Association of REALTORS and be able to practice and get access to the local MLS the barrier to entry to our industry has to be a little bit higher because this will prevent a flood of inexperienced and unserious professionals into the space frankly we've experienced that for a hundred years now because the barrier to entry into the space is so low if we formalized the entry into this just two steps higher than what it is right now and by getting passing that just a little bit higher bar you get amazing access to national data to this now higher higher regarded group of professionals because everybody in this group is here to play we're not just here to stand around and look at our stared our shoes the entire industry would benefit from this I would even advocate and again don't come at me on actually can come at me I don't care existing agents if this was something that at the NAR took on existing agents should have to retest in order to get into this new and improved system the long and short of it is the NARs the NAR took a real punch in the gut back and I think it was March of last year when the when the lawsuit settlement was issued $408 million I think in a cash penalty a whole bunch of regulatory I say regulatory they're not regulatory they're not regulations by the government just trade group policies that had to change and the real estate industry took it on the chin in the mass media for about three months here but the reality is things really haven't changed that much as in terms of the day-to-day operations of most real estate professionals which means to me or that what that says here is that the NAR is the face and the mouthpiece for an industry but the rest of us that are actually operating the industry and we don't actually believe that we don't think the NAR is representative of who we are and what we do we don't think of what they say is representative of what we say and what we think and so the NAR took this big punch in the gut in terms of the the penalty and all of the stuff that came along with it but most agents they just had to tolerate the news that came along with it and that was about it because I think you and I were talking before the show kicked off we all expected to see commission rates compress as a result of these lawsuits they have actually on average inflated you make more than you did pre-law suit settlement on average in the United States by like a tenth of a point which is a lot if you consider what you know what the typical you know a gross commission income is in the United States so I mean it's time the NAR and I think the right the writing isn't just on the wall it's starting we're starting to see this this happen this perception changing I don't I don't think we're going to see the same body in December 2026 as we see right now you brought up a good point about leveling up with our accreditation or just our skills and NAR being really it really should be their main focus it that really is part and parcel with going to Washington and saying we want to protect these jobs here's what we're doing so that Washington would hopefully look favorably on helping protect our jobs because if NAR could say here's what we're demanding of our members and we're we're doing now is you know the biggest challenge I've see in the you know getting getting into this business is just passing local or state and federal exams which are mostly based on memorization of facts and data and not necessarily use case like not necessarily like going out in the real world how do I actually apply the code of ethics what do I do in scenario a scenario b what should I do because ultimately that's what's most important is how are my applying the code of ethics to my business and there is very little information and and testing on that and it that needs to be the most important part of being a REALTOR because that's what the rubber meets the road like you were actually working with clients and you need to know if another REALTOR calls you and asks you this question you need to know what am I allowed to say in return and what am I not allowed to say how do I not violate fair housing when xyz question comes in you know there these are things that that they could focus on and people would have a better buying or selling experience consumers would would benefit the agent would benefit because they would know more and the whole industry would improve but it would have to be something that is probably demanded by at the federal or sorry at the at the national level of of the trade organization and say guys time to level up and we're going to provide all the training we're going to tell you exactly what to do and they can do that I don't know this isn't hard they can build these tools and they can train us and REALTORS will do it they will absolutely want to level up their skills and the ones that won't will self-select out and fine we don't want them anyway so yeah I'm with you I think that would be an amazing thing for n-a-r to take on yeah and and to your point like the the test test you have to pass for the bar exam medical boards all of these things include exactly what you described oh I know yeah real world scenarios and I mean truthfully you know the you know what I remember the most and this is a lot of years ago now so you know bear with me on this but you know what I remember the most from the real estate license exam in Michigan having to memorize how many square feet were in an acre and it's 4,600 or 560 excuse me I remember that because I knew I like it just did the math on the test I'm like okay all of these questions are worth the same I have to get like 60 questions right in order to pass this exam if I can I know that this will be on there so I spent an inordinate amount of time memorizing how many square feet were in an acre that has literally never come up once in my entire and you know what if it did come up I got a phone that could tell me these things I don't need to know that I'm not going to be googling the you know the things that will happen in the real world I'll actually just be navigating these things with my experience here here in Illinois if you are a stylist you must do and this is amazing we we don't often think about and please forgive anyone who is in this field I have so much respect for you I love my my the person that cuts my hair I think she's unbelievable but we don't often think of that as a super highly skilled job it's just somebody who's good at cutting hair but the reality is they have to do 1500 hours of of literal like apprenticeship before they can even practice that's after passing the test 1500 hours like we don't have any hours you have to do other than a couple of tests and maybe some post licensing stuff but I'm not saying we need at 1500 hours but like the reason why they do that is because you know they could they could hurt you there could be a medical issue if they cut you with scissors and yeah they feel like that is pretty important they're cutting around your brain like it's it's significant a significant part of the human body we need to make sure these people know exactly what they're doing even though we just think of them as they just cut hair no they are really really really skilled even though we don't give them the credit this is what we could bring to some version of this in to because we're dealing with somebody's in many cases their largest financial transaction this is as important as getting your haircut by somebody that's not going to poke your brain with their scissors like you have to know what to do and we're we push it off to brokerages like brokerages you're the ones who are going to really teach how to do this stuff and it's like that's not and because now you don't have any standard now there's no standard of practice and so that that's what I think I agree with you I think we could we could really push any art to deliver more there well to to your point I think you know my kind of final position on this as we wrap up is the reality is I think NAR is I'm pretty I feel pretty confident frankly that the NAR is going to start to change quickly in terms of its complexion I don't have super high expectations that my dream scenario will be fulfilled here so what does that mean for most agents it means that all of the benefits like the express benefits that we just talked through these are not industry standards or options which means that if you can find a way to create that value in your own business you have immediate advantage over all of your competitors like we do not have what I would consider to be anywhere close to a mature data analysis engine when it comes to the real estate industry like there are some third-party platforms that will do it for you but nothing that your local board or your state association or your national association like the the the level of detail granularity and how often you get data reports and how usable they are relative to your consumers we are 100 steps behind where we could be right now but the good news is you have access to that data via the MLS you can do this sort of analysis and be the smartest guy or gal in the room just by virtue of asking the right questions and having the data said to use AI in order to unanalys and draw the answer from you have that option everybody does but very few people are going to do it you can do this though and you know by default your competitors are not doing it so take advantage of the things that any of us should be doing and just do them for yourself level up your skill set with the sort of post-professional training that will give you an advantage that you can brag about later on do the things about advocacy you don't have to go to Washington to do this show up at your local zoning boards show up at school board committees show up at town council meetings wherever the sorts of decisions are being made on a local level show up listen provide your perspective in opinion you have the option of doing these things yourself if the NAR won't do them for you and by default your competitors won't do these things so if you do them you're immediately the smartest person in the room that's it it's easy it is it is a sacrifice of time and that's a decision that has to be made but we're not asking you I know I am not asking I don't think that this is at all a a sacrifice beyond what would be reasonably considered an ambitious professional and if you're not an ambitious professional then this isn't for you but if you are this is stuff that you can do right now if I was a practicing agent what I would be doing right now is I would be getting an API feed from my MLS I'd pay for that which is very reasonable I don't know you sometimes you see these API feeds as low as the IDX feed rather via API is usually I don't know 20 bucks a month maybe a hundred bucks a month at most somewhere in that neighborhood so you get that data feed you can have the your local MLS whatever the the data provider is that we'll sign off on that it's your data you have access to it you pay for this this access you can connect that to an AI engine whether it's Claude or or open AI or Gemini or whoever or make through through Zapier or make dot com you can connect these these data points to this data together and now you can have AI do what you exactly what you were saying is now start interpreting data in my local market give me the data that is going to help me service my clients more effectively and it will build it for you like you can literally have that data stored somewhere and then consistently update it and ask AI to pull out the most relevant information now you have to make sure the AI is getting you doing the doing the calculations correctly and that's a whole other thing but it will at least get you on the on the right track so you're right you don't have to wait for NAR or or another tool to be built you can now build these tools yourself and that's what I would be doing I mean we've done this ourselves with our brokerage we just now have a have a data feed straight to the MLS and we're building our own tools to figure out exactly what we need for our agents I mean it is the opportunity is now the opportunity is now and this is you know frankly I think most people will hear this you know kind of mid to late December you've got some time right now if you're listening to this mid to late December you are probably not working as much as you would be a month from now it takes some time to just sit reflect drink an eggnog and think about what all Uncle Chris and DJ have been saying here and think about what your 2026 plans are going to be to create the to create velocity around these opportunities because whether you do or do not you're making the choice to to go in one direction or another so and I guarantee you both will be hard so just choose the hard that you want do you want the hard that is associated with innovation and pushing your business forward or do you want the hard associated with standing still and watching your competitors pace out in front of you the choice seems pretty straightforward I mean but up to you guys enjoy your holiday break think about what you need to do in order to make 2026 successful and don't take your foot off the gas because remember anything you're doing now is going to bear fruit 90 to 100 days from now 90 to 120 days so you know let's this is time to reconnect with clients with your your sphere and let them know that you're thinking about them give them something of value that maybe even if it's just a re a prezel of what you believe their property is worth two days even if it's just that which by the way AI can sort of do and maybe do a decent job of but you with your local experience might do a better job so those are things that you could deliver hand deliver to everybody in your sphere this this holiday and say hey I was thinking about you here's something I think would be a value to and then you can start now having conversations about future plans all right Chris linsell.com is where you go to learn about everything Chris and I did not know you were in New York actually so that is exciting I'm glad you there I'm jealous please go visit Katz's deli if you haven't already but it's my favorite favorite deli in New York as well it's everybody's favorite deli in New York but yeah that's one of my favorite places and yeah on behalf of all of our audience thank you Chris for another year of amazing unpopular real estate opinions you're we appreciate you

not taken over not yet DJ pleasure talk to you soon you
