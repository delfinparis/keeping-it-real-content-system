[00:02:32] My conversation with Susan Santoro.
[00:02:47] All right.
[00:02:48] Today on the show, our guest is Susan Santoro from the Susan Santoro team with William Pitt
[00:02:54] Sotheby's International Realty in New Haven County in Connecticut.
[00:02:58] Now let me tell you more about Susan.
[00:03:01] Now, since 1985, Susan Santoro has held a prominent position as one of the most distinguished
[00:03:07] agents within the greater New Haven Shoreline region.
[00:03:10] As the foremost agent in sales at William Pitt Sotheby's International Realty's Guildford
[00:03:15] brokerage, she has garnered an reputation as an unparalleled performer, securing the
[00:03:19] number one agent title and claiming the number three spot across the entire company, operating
[00:03:26] as a cohesive unit.
[00:03:27] Susan leads the Susan Santoro team, which is a dedicated assembly of accomplished full-time
[00:03:31] REALTORS whose excellence earned them the Distinguished Top Real Estate Award from Inman
[00:03:36] based on sales, amassing over 73 million in transactions just last year.
[00:03:42] Now, year after year, her achievements are underscored by multiple awards, including
[00:03:46] the prestigious Connecticut Magazine 5 Star Real Estate Agent Award.
[00:03:51] She secured the highest ranking for overall satisfaction.
[00:03:54] That's a client award.
[00:03:56] Distinction showcased in Connecticut Magazine.
[00:03:59] In addition to that, she's super into philanthropy and giving back.

[00:04:08] unwavering dedication to fundraising, and also is involved with the Ronald McDonald House
[00:04:14] Trees of Hope.
[00:04:15] And we are just so honored to have Susan on the show before I bring, before Susan comes
[00:04:21] on.
[00:04:21] What everybody to follow her at Susan's Instagram.
[00:04:24] So go to Instagram, Susan Santoro underscore REALTOR.
[00:04:28] Now, we will have a link to that in the show notes as well as Susan's website.
[00:04:33] Susan, welcome to the show.
[00:04:35] Thank you.
[00:04:36] Nice introduction.
[00:04:37] Thank you.
[00:04:38] Thank you.
[00:04:38] Now, the last time I was for anyone who isn't, I'm going to interrupt myself now twice,
[00:04:43] as I'm getting through this.
[00:04:45] Anyone who isn't familiar with New Haven, New Haven is just outside of New York.
[00:04:50] It's right on the, basically right on the shore.
[00:04:53] And it is known for a number of things, most, probably most notably, people of New Haven
[00:04:59] will tell you, and they will tell you with a straight face that they invented pizza.
[00:05:03] Now I don't know if that's technically true or not, and that is a debatable topic.
[00:05:08] And I am not here to, maybe the final authority on whether it was in Naples, Italy or New Haven,
[00:05:14] but New Haven people are very, very proud of their pizza.
[00:05:18] And I have eaten New Haven pizza, and I've eaten the very famous Pepe's clam pizza,
[00:05:25] which sounds really gross for a lot of you listening, but it is delicious.
[00:05:29] So Susan, I am a big pizza fan, and I love the fact that I'm talking to a New Haven person,
[00:05:35] because I love your pizza.
[00:05:36] I look forward to treating you to it when you come, but it's between Pepe's and Sally's.
[00:05:41] We have these pizza wars all the time, and everybody has their favorite in Worcester Street.
[00:05:46] There are plenty of other places in New Haven also, and the pizza is good everywhere.
[00:05:51] I went to chat GBT for the official answer, and again, chat GBT, it's not exactly the Oracle at Delphi,
[00:05:58] but it's close to accurate, and I said, where was pizza originated?
[00:06:02] And it said, while people of New Haven will tell you that it's originated there,
[00:06:07] we believe it actually is from, was from Naples, but it's still not totally clear.
[00:06:13] So we'll go with New Haven.
[00:06:14] And you can get New Haven style pizza in your hometown too.
[00:06:18] Yeah, so for any Chicago people, if you are familiar with peace, which is always on the top,
[00:06:25] Chicago pizza places list, it's not Chicago style, which is the deep dish, you know,
[00:06:31] stuff, but it's thin crust, more of a taverny sort of style, but no, not tavern,
[00:06:37] but thin and big and just delicious. I am a huge fan of New Haven style.
[00:06:44] So anyway, we talk about pizza.
[00:06:51] But we want to talk about Susan in all of her amazing real estate accomplishments.
[00:06:56] Now, Susan, you've been in the industry nearly 40 years, which is so amazing and impressive,
[00:07:03] and you are still crushing it all these years later.
[00:07:07] I would love to start at the very beginning of your journey.
[00:07:10] Like, how did you get into real estate and why?
[00:07:12] So it was kind of an accident. My husband is a real estate developer and kind of ran out of land,
[00:07:19] and he did the place to build and was like, why don't you get your real estate license and go
[00:07:24] and look for some land for me to build on. So that's how it started and then thought,
[00:07:29] oh, we're going to have a family. I'm going to be a state-home mom.
[00:07:32] And then, you know, once you have a couple of good sales under your bell,
[00:07:37] you're either born with it or you're not that adrenaline that fired in your belly.
[00:07:41] You can't wait to make the next sale. And then it becomes addicting.
[00:07:45] And so by the time my daughter was born five years later, it was a major career.
[00:07:51] And I still wake up every single day with that fire. And I can't wait to see what the next deal
[00:07:57] is going to be. That's amazing. And it is, it is fun. I would like to ask you, what is the,
[00:08:04] what, what fuels that fire like inside of you? I'd never really asked this question, but I think
[00:08:10] it's a good one. Like, what do you, do you, are you aware of what it is inside of you? That is just
[00:08:15] so eager to keep going forward. Is there certain goals you're looking to hit? Is it just a feeling
[00:08:20] of satisfaction? Is it about helping? You know, what is it? So it's a lot of the above, except that I,
[00:08:26] except for the goal part. I am not believe it or not. Most successful people always say,
[00:08:30] oh, I've got this, you know, bored or this, you know, the goals of my year. I don't like goals.
[00:08:37] I just like to keep on going, keep on going. And you know, not many people that have asked me,
[00:08:42] you know, kind of like, what is your why? But the truth is, is I dropped out of college after my
[00:08:48] first year. I was never meant to go to college. My mom was not happy and told me that, you know,
[00:08:55] if you want to be successful in life, you have to have that opportunity and go to college and get
[00:09:00] a degree. So, and my dad, who ran a major corporation, was CEO of a major corporation,
[00:09:09] also didn't finish college. So I think it was one of those things like, I'm going to show her.
[00:09:16] And now we just, you know, we laugh about it every time I get an award. I send it to my mom and
[00:09:20] I say, let me know when I'm going to become something. So that was kind of my why. It makes my dad
[00:09:27] super happy. Still checks in on me weekly, wants to know my sales. And, you know, gets a big smile
[00:09:33] on his face. So I think, I think he remains my why. He wrote a wonderful book called Pilot Your
[00:09:40] Life. It sits on my desk and it's my motivational bible. It's a great, notable book for people in
[00:09:46] business. And he's definitely my why. Well, let's, yeah, let's give a plug for that book. Say the
[00:09:52] title one more time and your father's name. Pilot your life. Pilot your life. My dad is Ronald
[00:09:57] Shaw. He was the CEO of the Pilot Penn Corporation. Oh, well, we certainly know who they are. And in
[00:10:04] fact, I have, they have offices here in Chicago. And I have, I have friends that work at Pilot,
[00:10:11] oddly enough, I have one friend that works at pie or did. I don't know if she's still there. But,
[00:10:16] oh, that is wild. Oh, my gosh. Yes, that is a big company. Wow. And is it amazing not, not an MBA,
[00:10:23] not a college grad? And he was a CEO. Incredible. Yeah. And a lot of the book kind of talks about that,
[00:10:29] you know, and it's just that that competence level, you know, I raised my daughter saying, you know,
[00:10:35] make a decision, believe in it, own it. It's yours. And then just follow it. And that's just sort of a
[00:10:41] simple way of life, whether you're making a decision on going to a party or not or whether you're
[00:10:47] making a decision on a business transaction. I think it's all the same. Once you own that,
[00:10:53] you believe in it, you just keep going. And that's how I feel about my business. And I tell my
[00:10:59] team and other agents who ask me all the time, how do you still do these hours? You know, it's 60,
[00:11:05] 70 hours. Sometimes a week, how do you still do this after all these years? You wake up unemployed
[00:11:11] every single day in our business. And you have to go out and look your best. You know, if you
[00:11:18] wear makeup, put on your makeup, put on, you know, get dressed, just go out and present yourself
[00:11:23] the best way possible. And you will be a success. You'll be competent and it'll show. And with that
[00:11:30] comes success. You wake up unemployed every day. You know, that is so true. And it is, you know,
[00:11:39] I know there would be people to say, well, that's a negative way to look at it. But you know what?
[00:11:44] I have found that having that thought of, you know, it's something that's pushing against me
[00:11:51] versus something I'm running towards, like the idea that I'm unemployed. Oh my god, I got to pay
[00:11:56] my bills. That is, I think a more powerful motivator than like, for example, if I was, if I was
[00:12:03] being chased by somebody with a knife, I think I'd run faster than if I was running towards a
[00:12:08] million dollars. I bet I would run faster with a guy chasing me with a knife. So even though I would
[00:12:13] like not to be motivated by my pain, the reality, but it's true. We are as agents, we are unemployed
[00:12:20] every single morning when we wake up. And it's an opportunity to not only find business,
[00:12:25] but to keep the business that we do have and really treasure it because it can go away to moments
[00:12:31] notice. Absolutely. That is a really great lesson. And I think it's a great thing to know. People come
[00:12:34] up to you at parties, people come up to you at the grocery store. Everybody wants to know how the
[00:12:38] market is. Tell me about real estate or asking you about a particular property. And so that's where
[00:12:43] again, you're selling yourself constantly. How important is it for you to have that information
[00:12:51] about the local market on hand ready to talk and maybe, you know, to varying degrees of detail,
[00:12:57] I'm sure, but how important is it when you're at the grocery store? And someone's like, hey, Susan,
[00:13:02] you've been doing this forever. What's the market like? How do you typically address a question like
[00:13:08] that? So it's very important. And I am a statistics person. So I do look at the numbers every day,
[00:13:15] whether it's against, you know, me, my, I don't want to call them competitors, but you just
[00:13:20] associates, other associates. But I always kind of know what's going on. I look at percentages in,
[00:13:26] you know, I just wrote an offer, for instance, in Fairfield County. And I usually base just out of
[00:13:31] New Haven County, but because Yale, New Haven Hospital has bought off a hospital down in Fairfield
[00:13:36] County, we now have a lot of our doctors that are going that way as well. So I was just down there,
[00:13:42] and their business has done very differently than ours. But before I went down, I went and I looked
[00:13:47] at kind of where the numbers are. And I'm seeing that things are going approximately 13% over asking.
[00:13:55] So it was such an important tool for me to be able to share with my clients. We were, we crafted a
[00:14:01] great offer the first time they didn't want to go with that high over. And, and they didn't get the
[00:14:07] first house. And the second one, they listened to me. We crafted a perfect offer. The sellers could not
[00:14:12] say no to. And it went approximately 12.5% over asking. But our offer got signed. You know, so I think
[00:14:21] knowing the numbers is very important, knowing your market. And then of course, you know, you can
[00:14:30] always tell someone, you know what, I'm going to get back to you later. I'm going to look this up
[00:14:33] for you and create reason to make a phone call back to that person. Now you've captured them.
[00:14:40] It's like being stuck in an elevator. And you know, I love what one of, I just want to go back to one
[00:14:47] thing that you said that for me was was pretty rough. It's something that I can't remember another
[00:14:54] one of our guests saying in all the episodes we've done. So I just want to step on it a little bit
[00:14:59] because I think it's really, really a great idea. So it's Susan said and she said it very quickly.
[00:15:03] And I just want to make sure that everyone heard it. She said, you know, when she was about to produce
[00:15:08] an offer, she looked at, you know, obviously comparable places. She looked at list price and then
[00:15:12] sales price. And just did the quick math on what, you know, that percentage over was that way she
[00:15:17] can bring that data back to her client and say, here's why we should consider this type of offer
[00:15:23] based on, you know, other other comps. I don't know that a lot of agents do that. And that is a,
[00:15:29] you know, a lot of agents are like, okay, Mr. or Mrs. a buyer. How much do you want to spend? Okay,
[00:15:35] maybe we can go a little bit over. And it's more of just like finessing like the feeling of the
[00:15:41] buyer, but not actually bringing the hard data saying we should offer X based on, I think that is
[00:15:47] a really great idea for anyone who's working with offers. Do your homework. You know, before you go
[00:15:53] to do an open house and I tell the agents on my team, as I always remind them, pull up a circle
[00:15:59] on MLS as to everything around the area that you're doing the open house at. Know your statistics.
[00:16:07] Know what else is out there. That house might not be right for them. You can easily get in the car
[00:16:12] after you're open house and take them to look at your, the other listings around the area. So just
[00:16:17] do your homework. And you probably also in the county that you serve and I know you work, you know,
[00:16:23] a lot of places in Connecticut. But I imagine you know what neighborhoods people like our
[00:16:30] starter neighborhoods, you know where they graduate to when, you know, where the best schools are.
[00:16:36] All of this is we're talking really about knowing the community, knowing the inventory,
[00:16:41] knowing kind of what's happening. How much time do you think you spend every day sort of checking
[00:16:48] in on those stats? I do it every night. So I luckily I was born with not needing a lot of sleep,
[00:16:58] which works great in my personal practice. I, when the world gets quiet, you know, 11 to 2am,
[00:17:07] I'm on the computer, I'm just checking numbers, I'm checking towns, seeing what's new, seeing, you
[00:17:13] know, sales. That's when I work the best. So I would say I do it every single night. But in the
[00:17:19] beginning of my career, I did two open houses every single Sunday, did that for years. That's how I
[00:17:26] built my, you know, my list of clientele. And I always, always went on back then, you know,
[00:17:35] we had a book that we used to flip through and see what the listings were around the area and know,
[00:17:41] and know the sales. So I was able to just hopefully answer a question that may have come up in an
[00:17:46] open house. So I think it's a good practice. If you get out of the practice, that's not good.
[00:17:53] Yeah, get back in. It's, yeah, doing open houses, it's, it just is the thing to do. And it's always
[00:18:01] the thing to do. And technology has not really changed it too much to where open houses seem to be
[00:18:08] still very effective. Have, it probably drives you crazy when you see newer agents not wanting to
[00:18:16] sit open houses on the weekends. I think if I was a new agent, that I would beg other agents to
[00:18:23] let me come to their open house. I would beg them. Right. I tell them all the time here. I'm giving
[00:18:28] it to you. I mean, people are, the people that are walking in the door, some are just doing this as
[00:18:35] a hobby, right? They just want to go and see a nice house. But most of them are coming because they
[00:18:40] have an interest in buying a piece of real estate. It might not be that piece of real estate. But you
[00:18:46] now have their information, you hopefully have a conversation and get up a, you know, repertoire
[00:18:51] with them and they'll call you when they're ready to buy real estate or you can be in touch with them.
[00:18:56] And I think the technology today, if you get their email, you know, if you just drip on them and
[00:19:02] drip on them eventually when they're ready to buy real estate, what was that REALTOR's name I met?
[00:19:07] And it's going to be right on the top of their, you know, their head. So I think it's really
[00:19:11] important to put yourself out there and rather that open house gym, the grocery store, you know,
[00:19:20] my family makes fun of me, but I never, I'll never walk out the door not in a matching outfit or
[00:19:25] having my hair look good or whatever because you're, are we selling yourself? So and branding,
[00:19:31] branding, branding, you know, put your name, put your name everywhere that you're, you know,
[00:19:36] that that's allowed. So yeah. Totally, totally agree. I think those are all amazing ideas and
[00:19:43] it's things I agree with personally as well. So sort of the irony of you not being, you know,
[00:19:51] a college grad but being ultra successful in real estate is you actually work a lot with Yale,
[00:19:56] which is in New Haven as well. So, you know, you work with a lot of the doctors at Yale,
[00:20:02] you work, I think with faculty as well. So let's, you know, this is something that I don't think we've
[00:20:06] ever talked to anyone about is, you know, being sort of a friend to the university where you get,
[00:20:12] you know, sort of known amongst, you know, the management there that you're a person that can help
[00:20:18] when professors come in and leave or when physicians come and leave at the hospital. So can you talk
[00:20:24] a little bit about how do you build, how did you build those relationships and how does that
[00:20:30] how does that work for you? So, you know, it's become a niche, you know, I think I've mentioned to you
[00:20:37] that one of my clients years ago named me REALTOR to the Docs and that becomes my hashtag REALTOR
[00:20:43] to the Docs and it's not only it's not the only people that I work with clearly, but it was,
[00:20:49] it was kind of an accident. It was probably about 25 years ago sold a house to a chief of a department
[00:20:57] that was coming in and it was going to be a struggle. They were wooing him from Harvard, so it
[00:21:03] took a while, negotiations take a while. It was probably a good year that every time they'd come to town,
[00:21:09] I'd show them houses, show them around, get to know the area, took them for pizza, and we obviously
[00:21:16] finally got into contract and he said to me like I promise you I'm going to be building a very big
[00:21:21] department here and that department I have moved my, I've moved my 49th doctor into that department
[00:21:28] from him in 25 years. Now, obviously those those sales turn into, they multiply because then one
[00:21:37] of those doctors has someone coming from UCLA that they just came from, let's say, and from another
[00:21:44] department and then they give my name to that department and then that starts spreading around to
[00:21:48] department. So right now I have three departments that I really could get fed a lot of business from
[00:21:56] from the chiefs directly. Now that's it's a lot of work. It's not just, oh here's a doctor and
[00:22:02] they you go out and you show them a house. It's, I get them sometimes on their second interview here
[00:22:07] and they still have maybe four interviews to go. But they want to see if they can afford to live in
[00:22:14] Connecticut. So I'll take them in the car. I'll spend a day and you know it's kind of a you
[00:22:19] know I'm driving them around and educating them on the areas and just driving by house and say you
[00:22:24] know here's approximately what this one would go for. So I really give them a full education out of
[00:22:30] maybe 10 doctors that I'll take in my car that they've given me maybe one or two of them lucky
[00:22:36] to take the position. So it's not so it's a lot of time. Yeah. It's a lot of time but it pays off
[00:22:44] because like I said they what I find is that you know I'm educating these very brilliant people
[00:22:52] on such a different level right. I'm not I'm certainly not saving lives but I'm changing
[00:22:58] lives and they don't have a lot of time. So they come to me kind of I'm a very good listener because
[00:23:05] I have to be. They tell me what they're looking for and then if there's something obviously not on
[00:23:10] the market now but when they're ready I'll use my resources. I I don't love cold calling but I'll do
[00:23:17] it a lot of times I'll call my list of clients that I've a massed over 39 years and say you know
[00:23:25] do you know anybody who's looking to sell in your neighborhood I have this great couple coming to
[00:23:29] Yale they'd be perfect. I do a lot of letter writing personal letter writing and just sometimes get
[00:23:36] an open listing just say you know just let me just show it to this one client and a lot of people
[00:23:41] don't want their house on the market and they're thrilled to do it and it just becomes a smooth
[00:23:47] transaction and but I think it's I think it's an interesting you know kind of niche I kind of call
[00:23:55] it where healthcare you know meets and real estate merge right it's that yeah and I just like I said
[00:24:01] it's you know I think it's teaching them they're so brilliant but they don't know anything about
[00:24:07] real estate. Sure. They don't know what a septic tank is. Their eyes light off when they realize like
[00:24:14] what actually goes into a septic tank. You know they don't understand financing they know what they
[00:24:22] make they know they can afford what they can afford but they don't understand you know 15
[00:24:27] year versus a 30 year you know a fixed rate versus an arm so I love teaching them and and then
[00:24:35] you know like I said we kind of changed their lives quickly and I have to do it efficiently and move
[00:24:42] on. So I want to go back I want to go back to the open house sorry the the open listing idea
[00:24:51] because this was something that that stuck out as as you were mentioning so walk us through that
[00:24:56] because I don't know that everyone listening is going to understand what that means. So you know
[00:25:02] there in other areas not here you know they kind of pocket listings right there. Yeah sort of the
[00:25:08] same thing except that you know I will literally call someone in a neighborhood that I think it's
[00:25:14] perfect the house is perfect for and ask them you know would you be interested in selling. Here's
[00:25:20] what I think I could get you and you don't have to put your house on the market you don't have to
[00:25:26] clean it you don't have to you know pick your socks off the floor. Here's when they're going to be
[00:25:31] here let me bring them in and and it's simple and with COVID that was that was a gift to a lot of people
[00:25:39] who are so new to me. Who especially you know some of my doctors who obviously you know couldn't get sick
[00:25:47] and we just bring them into one house if it was perfect great we make the deal they're not as
[00:25:54] picky as someone that may have you know a no timeline you know they just they want they figure out
[00:26:00] what school system they want I always send them to like great schools dot org I let them do their
[00:26:05] own homework never steer anybody towards a school system because it's different for everybody you
[00:26:11] know somebody might be looking for a kid that's really strong in theater or really strong in math so
[00:26:18] you know I steer them to great schools dot org and then let them make their decision and then
[00:26:23] kind of pick out three towns and run. That's a great tip um the that that website for pushing that
[00:26:31] whole conversation off you know we could for ethics obviously we we can't really steer somebody
[00:26:37] towards a particular school but you can steer them towards the website and say do your own research.
[00:26:43] I have found in I just uh linkedin just told me I've been doing this for six years which I didn't
[00:26:49] realize um and I feel actually a little bit like god has been six years maybe maybe I need to hang
[00:26:54] it up but no I'm having too much fun doing it but um the reason I'm bringing that up is um
[00:27:01] gosh I don't know I just lost my train of thought oh no it was it was about um what I was
[00:27:07] reflecting on over the last six years sorry um so over the last six years I was thinking a lot about
[00:27:13] when I saw that I've been doing the six years I was like okay what are some of the common elements
[00:27:17] of some of these top producers and you just said something that I think is incredibly important
[00:27:23] and I think for someone like you is kind of just like that's what you do but I think a lot of
[00:27:28] filters don't do this what Susan basically just said was that she goes and finds her own inventory
[00:27:35] for her buying clients right she's not just scouring the MLS which of course she is doing that too
[00:27:41] she's like you know I'm gonna just uh the lava call over to sew and sew down the street because
[00:27:47] that's the perfect house for my client and I'm gonna see if they would be willing to sell
[00:27:51] I find that that is something that top REALTORS often will do and other agents just doesn't even
[00:27:58] occur to them they just look at the MLS that's what's there if it's not on there sorry can't help you
[00:28:03] I love that so you are literally I think it also depends I think it also depends on the age
[00:28:08] you know the the Gen Z's that don't like to make phone calls um I've been home out fun a lot
[00:28:15] in my career right a lot of doors get shut in your face keep going right just keep going the next door
[00:28:22] is open and um and just don't don't let it stop you yeah I think it's it's so important because
[00:28:28] people either you can wait for them to get ready to sell their home or you can proactively go to
[00:28:35] them and say here's what I think I can get you if you're interested and I know that everyone's got
[00:28:41] a price everyone's got a price for their home that they would be willing to move even if it's
[00:28:47] there forever home so you know if if you know I you know I might think I'm in my forever place now
[00:28:53] but if you came to me with a hundred percent return offer like that I would made a hundred percent on
[00:29:00] uh that's not my forever home anymore I'm gonna find something else so that is such a smart opening
[00:29:05] line for that is fill in the blank if I could get you X I yes you would sell your house right
[00:29:13] and fill in the blank and see what they say I love that you might you might be thinking that they're
[00:29:20] thinking here when they're really just thinking here yeah so um you know on a good example of that
[00:29:27] is I had somebody call me once for a donation and they asked me if I would and I it was an
[00:29:34] organization who was important to me but I had given to them before and I was planning on giving more
[00:29:40] that year that particular year and they called me and said just wondering if you would match your
[00:29:46] donation from last year Dom so I matched my donation they could have gotten double from me if their
[00:29:54] approach was different yeah that is really absolutely it's all in the presentation all in the
[00:30:03] presentation thank you for that is such a great great tip I I love that let's let's talk about
[00:30:09] presentation when you go into a listing presentation let's say for example and let's say it's not a
[00:30:18] instant slam donk it's not a past client it's it's you're you're in competition maybe with another
[00:30:24] agent how do you approach listing presentations and because obviously you win a lot of them so tell
[00:30:31] us about what you do in a listing presentation that you think maybe is a little different so
[00:30:37] interesting that you say that because the thing that you said that really stands out is what people
[00:30:41] think right oh this is slam donk what I tell anybody who will listen to me nothing is a slam donk
[00:30:48] if you're going on a listing presentation of your brother's house be prepared everybody is a client
[00:30:56] everybody deserves to get the best to make you know hopefully make a profit but everyone deserves to
[00:31:03] be treated exactly the same and I'll go back to that in a second just saying that you know I I think
[00:31:10] of common thread when I read some of my you know hundreds and hundreds of Google reviews is when
[00:31:16] people come back and they say you know she treated us like we were her only client and I think
[00:31:21] that's really important is that you give whether they're spending a hundred thousand or a hundred
[00:31:27] million it doesn't matter treat everybody the same because their house is their castle and so I try to
[00:31:35] do I like to do a two-step program not everyone will tell you it's the best way to do it but I like to
[00:31:42] go out the first time if I don't know the people I don't know the house give me a tour and I take notes
[00:31:48] tell me what you've done tell me what you love about living here and then I come back you know
[00:31:53] tell me I have to do my homework because I don't care how good you are you can't go out and tell
[00:31:58] someone a price of a house without seeing it it's impossible so to work and by the way I want to
[00:32:03] pause you for a second because it and I want you to keep going with this but this is what a consultant
[00:32:07] does a consultant goes into a company and says tell me about the company and then they go I'm going
[00:32:12] to come back and give you my findings so this is what we're talking about with the two-step process
[00:32:17] you're doing it very much like a consultant what right do your home you know go back do your
[00:32:22] homework and then come back and show them that's you know sometimes I'll talk about a little bit of
[00:32:27] my marketing on that first interview you know kind of what I do you know very quick they're always
[00:32:32] like well you know what's your commission you know well we're going to go over everything when I
[00:32:36] come back because there's so much more to tell you about what I'm going to do for you and it's
[00:32:41] always about what you're going to do for them you know and not for yourself and so I don't go
[00:32:49] in prepared to you know sign right here on the dotted line I may lose some I have gone out on
[00:32:58] a few in my career and where I'm called back you know the next day and they say oh we signed with
[00:33:03] someone to meet they that person was maybe just buying the listing they told him a really high
[00:33:10] number that sure you know that they wanted to hear and get him to sign on the dotted line I like
[00:33:15] to be realistic and otherwise they're going to call me every single day why hasn't my house sold
[00:33:21] so I like to do my homework and give them real facts and I'll never take more than 48 hours before
[00:33:29] I go back but I like to be prepared you know it's so funny because I've been talking to top producers
[00:33:36] I guess for six years now and they pretty much everyone you know has a similar sort of answer like
[00:33:44] like you were saying you know well not the two-step approach always but but doing your homework
[00:33:49] going in with you know information having a presentation and really having it very well practiced
[00:33:56] I suspect that is missing from a lot of REALTOR training I think a lot of agents don't get
[00:34:04] that sort of training of listing presentation buyer presentation you know how do you you know
[00:34:09] how are you extracting information how are you collecting that information and then how are you
[00:34:14] using that information to you know hopefully get the deal it is it is something that is a real
[00:34:20] art and a science I believe and something that you're obviously part so you're when you first go
[00:34:25] out there you're on like a more of a fact-finding mission you're like tell me about the home
[00:34:29] tell me about all the things that that you want or that you've done to the home and you collect
[00:34:34] all this information and then you go back you process it you put it through some some different
[00:34:40] metrics and then you're like okay here's what just like a consultant here's my report here's what
[00:34:45] we're going to do and I come back with a nice bound book and it is not just statistics about
[00:34:51] you know William Pitt's otherbies but you know and about me and what I've done but the marketing
[00:34:57] I bring them you know actual you know photos and show them the difference of here's a cell phone
[00:35:02] photo versus my professional photographer I have I'm not a good photographer so just because of that
[00:35:09] I've used a professional photographer for 20 years so that's important I think that people need
[00:35:16] to see it touch it feel it and I bring them this book show them here's what I'm going to do for you
[00:35:22] show them the advertising I show them you know where their house is going to appear how it's
[00:35:28] going to appear and then give them real facts here's the house that sold you know within your
[00:35:33] neighborhood oh well then why isn't my house worth that much well because they have a brand new
[00:35:38] kitchen and you know yours is from the 1970s I mean I don't say that but you know I try to give
[00:35:44] them the reasons as to why I think their house is worth what I think it's worth and then we talk
[00:35:50] about just the kind of the art of pricing right not just that 99 cent pricing you know the ending
[00:35:57] with the 99 sure but I have always sort of said you know it's really important to let the buyer
[00:36:04] perceive a value you to me you cast a wider net the wider your net the more people that come in
[00:36:12] the more people that come in the more offers you're going to get the more offers you're going to get
[00:36:16] the higher your price is going to be so I think that's coming on you know right here's your market
[00:36:22] value let's come on under your market value let's cast that wider net and you know you're kind of like
[00:36:28] walk into a department store right that that lost leader at the end of the aisle it got you to
[00:36:33] get into the store and then you're going to spend more that's what we want we want more people to walk
[00:36:38] in we need the traffic to get your price up so I think it's just important to tell them all aspects
[00:36:45] about marketing I think so too and there is this psychological principle called escalation of
[00:36:52] commitment so what Susan's basically saying is hey maybe it's smarter to price it slightly under
[00:36:58] under market value so that we have more people competing and the reason why that's significant for
[00:37:05] human beings is we are wired to as we agree to something as we want to continue to agree to
[00:37:13] something so that's what's called escalation of commitment you guys can google it but it's
[00:37:17] basically a psychological principle it says the more as you continue to say yes to something you
[00:37:24] you become more and more committed it's harder actually to pull out so in other words if you're
[00:37:30] going back and forth with somebody on pricing you know there's multiple offers there's bids
[00:37:35] it's actually more likely that those two people will continue to battle it out versus one person
[00:37:41] saying I'm leaving so it's actually a really smart play because it plays into our human nature of
[00:37:46] wanting something and wanting to compete and and win and achieve which is built into us so that's
[00:37:53] a really smart idea is get a lot of people interested in the property and then you can you know have
[00:37:57] them all battle it out right exactly and I think also back to that kind of two step I think that
[00:38:02] the other idea behind it is it gives you time if you don't know the people give you time to maybe
[00:38:08] maybe make a connection right now you you can go down a rabbit hole certainly on social media
[00:38:14] and figure out who they might know or you know find out oh they used to work for this company
[00:38:21] you know oh did you did you work with so-and-so and you know it's about oh gosh 35 years ago I think
[00:38:29] I had a marketing company look at all these notes I had received in the five years I had been in
[00:38:34] business a beautiful thank you notes from my clients and they came up with a tagline and it's
[00:38:40] real trust real care in real estate and that's what they came up with after looking at all of that I
[00:38:46] care about people I really I really truly care about them I have a baby shower of a client I'm going
[00:38:53] to in a couple of weeks I've been invited to weddings and bar mitzvahs and barbecues and that's
[00:38:59] a testament to me just fostering my relationships with people but I like my physicians maybe I'm
[00:39:06] just a you know I should have been a doctor in my other life if I ever wanted to go to college
[00:39:11] I love medicine I'm fascinated by it and making them my friends has not only you know it's been great
[00:39:18] because I get to learn but obviously it's helped in my career because they just continue to refer
[00:39:24] me and refer me and it's all this business if you want to stay in a long term it's just all about
[00:39:31] relationships and I have a team that I started about 10 years ago only two people on it I don't want
[00:39:38] more a very different team I kind of you know I say it's like one plus one plus one equals three
[00:39:46] you know putting our ideas and thoughts together and also putting our volume together
[00:39:51] just makes us greater you know it's small team but number one small team in Connecticut
[00:39:58] means a lot more than just an individual person and absolutely unique people you know
[00:40:06] everyone's different again fostering relationships one of the girls has been with me about 10
[00:40:10] years she's a marathon runner great connections right she's out there selling herself all of the time
[00:40:18] obviously it made up a t-shirt so it says the Susan Santoro team but then in the back in big letters
[00:40:23] down her back says REALTOR let someone come up and ask her a question while she's out running or
[00:40:28] at the end of a marathon tap into that right one of the other girls has been with me about four years
[00:40:35] she's a mom of three kids that is your perfect audience get involved with their sports get involved
[00:40:43] with their you know PTA so you know I love to be able to problem solve with them love tree I
[00:40:50] would have teach them how to tap into their resources and go through your index cards and call
[00:40:57] people Q4 I said I'm not a goal setter in the beginning Q4 is my very favorite quarter
[00:41:05] because I like to look and see how much I could actually accomplish in Q4 so I go through my
[00:41:10] address book and I reach out to as many clients as I possibly can in a week that's amazing you
[00:41:18] know that is a great idea because most people step off the gas and Q4 you know we have the holidays
[00:41:25] we have family stuff week it's the best but you you step on the gas absolutely it's my it's my
[00:41:31] very favorite time and I like to see like what can I accomplish between now and then so and again
[00:41:38] I don't set myself a number goal but you know well sometimes it's just as simple as an email you know
[00:41:45] hey drove by your house today love the new color of your front door or you know pick up a phone you
[00:41:50] know was thinking about you know or look on look on Facebook right see how old their kids are now
[00:41:56] have a reason to call them fostering relationships is key if you want to stay long term in this
[00:42:04] business it's definitely the key to my success and thank god for social media in the sense that we
[00:42:10] now do get information about our clients if we're following them and we get to enjoy their lives as
[00:42:18] they post about it and it like Susan like you just said I get to call hey I just saw you on a trip
[00:42:24] to cancun hope it was great it's it's the perfect reason to pick up the phone and not have to do a
[00:42:32] sales pitch on oh by the way you know I you know it because you that can always come up naturally as
[00:42:37] well but I want to I want to go back to something you said that I think is really critical and I
[00:42:42] think it comes through is care and trust what you're really doing is because I believe that care
[00:42:49] and trust are earned not automatically given and you have a huge an amazing history of constantly
[00:42:58] demonstrating care and trust and therefore that when you know it's funny that you're niche one of
[00:43:05] your niches is doctors because I think I think the same way when I choose a doctor for myself a physician
[00:43:11] I the only thing I really really it's most important to me is that do I think this physician cares
[00:43:19] about me even just a little bit if they care about me I'm good if I feel that they don't care about
[00:43:24] then I'm I'm gonna look for another doctor so I use that same principle when I when I'm going to
[00:43:31] to see a doctor I want I want I want them to actually care about me people want the same thing
[00:43:36] obviously in a REALTOR in any in any service position so I think that is is such an important
[00:43:43] thing is demonstrating care and trust is really should be a if if people are gonna set goals
[00:43:51] I think that's a heck of a good goal to set is I want everyone of my clients to go you know Susan
[00:43:58] cares about me or DJ cares about me or whatever that that is worth its weight in goal absolutely
[00:44:05] now what are what do you do to stay in touch with clients in between transactions because of
[00:44:11] course people you know buy their home and maybe they don't move forever or for 10 years or what
[00:44:18] are we doing to stay in touch and make sure they don't forget about you anniversary cards happy
[00:44:23] anniversary right some people are like oh my gosh I can't believe it in this house seven years
[00:44:28] because you forget right you forget how long you've been in it so I'll always write in the
[00:44:32] card how long sometimes I'll you know write little personal notes thanks giving I don't do
[00:44:39] Christmas I don't do Hanukkah I don't sometimes I'll do New Year's thanks giving thanks giving
[00:44:45] card it's a great time to say thank you you're just as exactly what you're saying thank you for
[00:44:50] your referrals even if they've never given you one they may have thought that they've mentioned
[00:44:57] your name it may not have panned out but you're thanking them I do send a gift I I can't talk about
[00:45:04] you know what it is because you're not supposed to but I do send a gift to every client who does
[00:45:10] give me a referral after closing and and they're so appreciative of it and very surprised
[00:45:17] when they get it and and then they like the idea of getting this gift and so then they try to
[00:45:23] give you more so one of my departments at Yale there's two girls who are in competition to see who
[00:45:31] and they keep calling me who's given you more referrals this year so it's actually become like this
[00:45:36] very funny game but I'm I like I said I do that Q4 I do spend a lot of time I have an
[00:45:46] I have a mold fashion right I have an index box with all of my client's names on an individual card
[00:45:52] and they're in each month of when they bought it makes it easy I'm obviously I have it on
[00:45:57] computer also but I'm visual so I go through that card box and I'll start calling you know just
[00:46:04] checking in sending a note like I said send an email there's so many things that you can do
[00:46:11] you do get hit up I'm not going to tell you don't for donations you know kids
[00:46:17] ad blocks or you know will you buy a pie or buy a candy I do I always buy any
[00:46:24] when it comes to me it says they want you know trying to self-food I buy it and bring it down
[00:46:28] to the Ronald McDonald House because it's a very unfortunately a full house all the time
[00:46:33] so I'll always drop stuff there but so yeah you do get hit up you do have to go out for drinks
[00:46:39] or dinner or lunch once in a while I don't mind it again I love to learn things from people
[00:46:46] so it just goes back to that being a good listener and you just if you just quiet for a minute
[00:46:54] and just listen to somebody else you're gonna gain something that's going to be momentous for you
[00:47:01] it's just gonna change things for you they might not realize that they're telling you about their
[00:47:08] neighbor who is going into a retirement home they just might mention that not thinking about
[00:47:14] business I heard that I'm going back to my office I look up that neighbor's name and I write
[00:47:22] that neighbor a letter and I keep in touch and I keep sending letters until that neighbor calls me
[00:47:27] for a listing point so good good listening just be a good listener be a good listener and be
[00:47:34] inquisitive like ask lots of questions about someone else's life right like know what is going on
[00:47:42] because home and life is connected right where they're intricate they're obviously interchangeable
[00:47:49] you know your life in your home is is really one thing and so being in touch with what's going
[00:47:55] on in your clients lives and listening as you mentioned allows you to just learn about what other
[00:48:02] opportunities may exist that they might not have even thought as an opportunity for you they're just
[00:48:08] sharing you know parts of their life right and I think you know the other thing is don't make it about
[00:48:13] yourself very simply I'm just coming to mind quickly you sent me an email two days ago and
[00:48:23] I had a nutty day and I actually was traveling back from Chicago visiting my family and
[00:48:29] and then had a crazy day just hit the ground running so instead of writing you an email saying you
[00:48:35] know I'm sorry right I'm sorry is about me and you probably don't realize this but I wrote you and
[00:48:42] just said thanks for your patience now I've made it about you yes so it's very important to realize
[00:48:50] none of this is about me me me you know there's lots of agents out there who are going to post every day
[00:48:57] you know I'm the best I'm the greatest and there there's enough business to go around that
[00:49:02] some people want to deal with people like that that's fine but I tried to I want to make it about you
[00:49:08] make it about the client what can I do for you not what it's going to do for me and make me number one
[00:49:13] that will come just make it about make it about your client yeah demonstrate care and trust
[00:49:21] it just it all it all goes back to that this this accountability thing too is is acknowledging thank you
[00:49:27] for your patience you know if if you you know we're delayed on a on a response or an email thank you
[00:49:35] so much for your patience here's the answer that you're looking for exactly absolutely brilliant versus
[00:49:42] saying I'm sorry DJ sorry DJ it's not about DJ it's about telling the client hey you're time
[00:49:49] I kept waiting right yeah I kept you waiting yes I am sorry about that but I I acknowledge what you
[00:49:56] have you that's a really smart smart idea we have care real trust in real estate it's my tagline actually
[00:50:04] I should if I you know I want it someday maybe I'll get a tattoo someday but but it is it's a
[00:50:10] motto that I live by how important is it to have a niche to read whether it's you know you're you
[00:50:19] know you work with doctors you work with with faculty at Yale obviously you have you know other
[00:50:24] clients as well but how important is it to have a specialty like just like doctors have specialties
[00:50:30] I think nowadays I guess if I was to get into the business again you know if I was new I would
[00:50:37] try to focus more on that I think there's a lot of people who have made that really their success
[00:50:44] you know the you know the you know waterfront specialist or that this specialist I think you know
[00:50:53] I can't really call being a REALTOR to the docs by my niche but I guess it just what I sell you
[00:51:01] know myself in is just the time that I can dedicate to them like sometimes they don't even realize
[00:51:06] what time it is especially the ones in training you know they're doing the residency here they're
[00:51:12] in surgery they get out two in the morning and they're sitting down and they might be looking
[00:51:16] online to see all the stuff that I you know sent to them to look at today all the new listings
[00:51:22] and they don't even think twice they'll start texting me yeah and sometimes I'll surprise them
[00:51:27] and answer them at two-third year three in the morning um you know other times I won't and you
[00:51:33] know try to say okay I get a little respect of time but um but I think that that's you know really
[00:51:41] important I pay attention to them and so I think that that's sort of the niche thing again came
[00:51:47] about kind of by accident like that but that's when people come to me and they say oh doctor so
[00:51:53] and so recommend you I'm gonna be you know I'm coming in in the neurology department um great you
[00:52:00] know and they said yeah I was told that you never sleep so it's like it's become a joke but they
[00:52:06] love that that I can dedicate so much time to them a lot of times people are they're texting or
[00:52:12] calling me even on WhatsApp because they're coming from another country and I'm able to you know
[00:52:18] talk to them at crazy hours so I think depending on what your your niche is um you can really hone in
[00:52:26] on it I just interviewed with another department at Yale I'm not gonna mention them by name and
[00:52:33] the chief sent me a nice note the other day and said you know we'd like to take you on as
[00:52:38] as our REALTOR if you don't mind we're interviewing if you don't mind we're interviewing a few people
[00:52:43] next week you know that we're gonna have you take out terrific so you know it's another department
[00:52:50] so again it's no one's paying me to do this so you don't get paid until you're sitting at a
[00:52:56] closing and I think that goes back to that drive of waking up unemployed every day you know we
[00:53:04] don't make a dime till you're sitting at a closing and don't forget that the deal doesn't end when
[00:53:10] you write the contract and it gets accepted there's so much more to it you you want to be able to
[00:53:17] give somebody my kids a lot of a treat today oh you know we're new in the area we don't know anybody
[00:53:22] you know do you have a pediatric a pediatric ortho you can give us so sure you know that's what
[00:53:28] you want you want that you want to be that person that they come to for the name of a restaurant
[00:53:32] anything so I think that that's really important that just don't let the deal end actually write the
[00:53:39] contract yeah it's so you boy you said you said a lot uh just there and a lot of really really
[00:53:47] great stuff um I could not agree with you more I think it's super imperative that people think about
[00:53:57] you know the kind of uh relationships they want to have with their clients and to think well what do
[00:54:04] I have to do to earn that relationship what do I have to do to earn somebody saying something like
[00:54:09] oh this person cares about me my my REALTOR likes uh actually is is invested you know in my happiness
[00:54:17] um like if they can say that they're gonna sing your names the pray you know they're gonna
[00:54:23] scre sing it from the mountaintops um to everyone else the other thing too is you know thinking about
[00:54:29] niches and you're talking about working with physicians is you probably just by being around them you've
[00:54:36] studied kind of what physicians are like what their needs are um you know obviously everybody's different
[00:54:42] but they have commonality I'm sure there's certain needs uh and and you have just been a student of
[00:54:49] of you know whatever departments you've worked in to where I suspect you're almost thinking you
[00:54:54] almost think of yourself almost as an employee even of some of these uh you know other departments
[00:55:00] and some of the doctors that you come and think I am um you know and they think I'm working for the
[00:55:06] hospital or the university and um you know sometimes I have to if I if comes off you know
[00:55:12] explain that I'm not and you know here's how I got here's how you got to me um but you know it's
[00:55:19] uh again just relationship building and caring caring caring so um I'm today in fact I'm just as
[00:55:26] I'm talking to you I just got a an alert just popped up on my computer a client who I sold a house
[00:55:33] two three years ago in the military and um was given my name from another REALTOR who follows me
[00:55:40] online sold them a house you know not too far from here they've been doing a lot of work to the
[00:55:47] house they reached out to media of a plumber a given electrician so they sent me a note last week
[00:55:51] and said you know we'd love to have you over um to show you what we've done to the house
[00:55:56] and most REALTORS would be like if they're not selling you know I'm not gonna go over
[00:56:00] and it is going to take up an hour and a half of my time today um and they may alarm just
[00:56:06] went off just reminding me that that's where I'm going today at four o'clock so you know it yes it's
[00:56:12] it's 45 minutes there it's 45 minutes back I'll probably sit there and you know visit with them
[00:56:18] for an hour and a half okay but three hours of time if their neighbor decides to sell their house
[00:56:23] who's gonna be on the top of their head yes so you've got to just take the time to do stuff like that
[00:56:31] and um I'm excited to see what they've done to the house and I really truly do care but that's
[00:56:37] that's that's the whole point is that you are happy to and it's not always easy to drive 45
[00:56:43] minutes each way it's not easy but you're excited to do it and it's what ultimately demonstrates
[00:56:49] care and compassion and I I'm in this I'm a professional and I want to see this all the way through
[00:56:58] Susan this has been such a such a fun episode you have given our audience an incredible
[00:57:04] amount of strategies and techniques and tips and you know from your 39 years in the business

Now, we will have a link to that in the show notes as well as Susan's website. Susan, welcome to the show. Thank you. Nice introduction. Thank you. Thank you. Now, the last time I was for anyone who isn't, I'm going to interrupt myself now twice, as I'm getting through this. Anyone who isn't familiar with New Haven, New Haven is just outside of New York. It's right on the, basically right on the shore. And it is known for a number of things, most, probably most notably, people of New Haven will tell you, and they will tell you with a straight face that they invented pizza. Now I don't know if that's technically true or not, and that is a debatable topic. And I am not here to, maybe the final authority on whether it was in Naples, Italy or New Haven, but New Haven people are very, very proud of their pizza. And I have eaten New Haven pizza, and I've eaten the very famous Pepe's clam pizza, which sounds really gross for a lot of you listening, but it is delicious. So Susan, I am a big pizza fan, and I love the fact that I'm talking to a New Haven person, because I love your pizza. I look forward to treating you to it when you come, but it's between Pepe's and Sally's. We have these pizza wars all the time, and everybody has their favorite in Worcester Street. There are plenty of other places in New Haven also, and the pizza is good everywhere. I went to chat GBT for the official answer, and again, chat GBT, it's not exactly the Oracle at Delphi, but it's close to accurate, and I said, where was pizza originated? And it said, while people of New Haven will tell you that it's originated there, we believe it actually is from, was from Naples, but it's still not totally clear. So we'll go with New Haven. And you can get New Haven style pizza in your hometown too. Yeah, so for any Chicago people, if you are familiar with peace, which is always on the top, Chicago pizza places list, it's not Chicago style, which is the deep dish, you know, stuff, but it's thin crust, more of a taverny sort of style, but no, not tavern, but thin and big and just delicious. I am a huge fan of New Haven style. So anyway, we talk about pizza. But we want to talk about Susan in all of her amazing real estate accomplishments. Now, Susan, you've been in the industry nearly 40 years, which is so amazing and impressive, and you are still crushing it all these years later. I would love to start at the very beginning of your journey. Like, how did you get into real estate and why? So it was kind of an accident. My husband is a real estate developer and kind of ran out of land, and he did the place to build and was like, why don't you get your real estate license and go and look for some land for me to build on. So that's how it started and then thought, oh, we're going to have a family. I'm going to be a state-home mom. And then, you know, once you have a couple of good sales under your bell, you're either born with it or you're not that adrenaline that fired in your belly. You can't wait to make the next sale. And then it becomes addicting. And so by the time my daughter was born five years later, it was a major career. And I still wake up every single day with that fire. And I can't wait to see what the next deal is going to be. That's amazing. And it is, it is fun. I would like to ask you, what is the, what, what fuels that fire like inside of you? I'd never really asked this question, but I think it's a good one. Like, what do you, do you, are you aware of what it is inside of you? That is just so eager to keep going forward. Is there certain goals you're looking to hit? Is it just a feeling of satisfaction? Is it about helping? You know, what is it? So it's a lot of the above, except that I, except for the goal part. I am not believe it or not. Most successful people always say, oh, I've got this, you know, bored or this, you know, the goals of my year. I don't like goals. I just like to keep on going, keep on going. And you know, not many people that have asked me, you know, kind of like, what is your why? But the truth is, is I dropped out of college after my first year. I was never meant to go to college. My mom was not happy and told me that, you know, if you want to be successful in life, you have to have that opportunity and go to college and get a degree. So, and my dad, who ran a major corporation, was CEO of a major corporation, also didn't finish college. So I think it was one of those things like, I'm going to show her. And now we just, you know, we laugh about it every time I get an award. I send it to my mom and I say, let me know when I'm going to become something. So that was kind of my why. It makes my dad super happy. Still checks in on me weekly, wants to know my sales. And, you know, gets a big smile on his face. So I think, I think he remains my why. He wrote a wonderful book called Pilot Your Life. It sits on my desk and it's my motivational bible. It's a great, notable book for people in business. And he's definitely my why. Well, let's, yeah, let's give a plug for that book. Say the title one more time and your father's name. Pilot your life. Pilot your life. My dad is Ronald Shaw. He was the CEO of the Pilot Penn Corporation. Oh, well, we certainly know who they are. And in fact, I have, they have offices here in Chicago. And I have, I have friends that work at Pilot, oddly enough, I have one friend that works at pie or did. I don't know if she's still there. But, oh, that is wild. Oh, my gosh. Yes, that is a big company. Wow. And is it amazing not, not an MBA, not a college grad? And he was a CEO. Incredible. Yeah. And a lot of the book kind of talks about that, you know, and it's just that that competence level, you know, I raised my daughter saying, you know, make a decision, believe in it, own it. It's yours. And then just follow it. And that's just sort of a simple way of life, whether you're making a decision on going to a party or not or whether you're making a decision on a business transaction. I think it's all the same. Once you own that, you believe in it, you just keep going. And that's how I feel about my business. And I tell my team and other agents who ask me all the time, how do you still do these hours? You know, it's 60, 70 hours. Sometimes a week, how do you still do this after all these years? You wake up unemployed every single day in our business. And you have to go out and look your best. You know, if you wear makeup, put on your makeup, put on, you know, get dressed, just go out and present yourself the best way possible. And you will be a success. You'll be competent and it'll show. And with that comes success. You wake up unemployed every day. You know, that is so true. And it is, you know, I know there would be people to say, well, that's a negative way to look at it. But you know what? I have found that having that thought of, you know, it's something that's pushing against me versus something I'm running towards, like the idea that I'm unemployed. Oh my god, I got to pay my bills. That is, I think a more powerful motivator than like, for example, if I was, if I was being chased by somebody with a knife, I think I'd run faster than if I was running towards a million dollars. I bet I would run faster with a guy chasing me with a knife. So even though I would like not to be motivated by my pain, the reality, but it's true. We are as agents, we are unemployed every single morning when we wake up. And it's an opportunity to not only find business, but to keep the business that we do have and really treasure it because it can go away to moments notice. Absolutely. That is a really great lesson. And I think it's a great thing to know. People come up to you at parties, people come up to you at the grocery store. Everybody wants to know how the market is. Tell me about real estate or asking you about a particular property. And so that's where again, you're selling yourself constantly. How important is it for you to have that information about the local market on hand ready to talk and maybe, you know, to varying degrees of detail, I'm sure, but how important is it when you're at the grocery store? And someone's like, hey, Susan, you've been doing this forever. What's the market like? How do you typically address a question like that? So it's very important. And I am a statistics person. So I do look at the numbers every day, whether it's against, you know, me, my, I don't want to call them competitors, but you just associates, other associates. But I always kind of know what's going on. I look at percentages in, you know, I just wrote an offer, for instance, in Fairfield County. And I usually base just out of New Haven County, but because Yale, New Haven Hospital has bought off a hospital down in Fairfield County, we now have a lot of our doctors that are going that way as well. So I was just down there, and their business has done very differently than ours. But before I went down, I went and I looked at kind of where the numbers are. And I'm seeing that things are going approximately 13% over asking. So it was such an important tool for me to be able to share with my clients. We were, we crafted a great offer the first time they didn't want to go with that high over. And, and they didn't get the first house. And the second one, they listened to me. We crafted a perfect offer. The sellers could not say no to. And it went approximately 12.5% over asking. But our offer got signed. You know, so I think knowing the numbers is very important, knowing your market. And then of course, you know, you can always tell someone, you know what, I'm going to get back to you later. I'm going to look this up for you and create reason to make a phone call back to that person. Now you've captured them. It's like being stuck in an elevator. And you know, I love what one of, I just want to go back to one thing that you said that for me was was pretty rough. It's something that I can't remember another one of our guests saying in all the episodes we've done. So I just want to step on it a little bit because I think it's really, really a great idea. So it's Susan said and she said it very quickly. And I just want to make sure that everyone heard it. She said, you know, when she was about to produce an offer, she looked at, you know, obviously comparable places. She looked at list price and then sales price. And just did the quick math on what, you know, that percentage over was that way she can bring that data back to her client and say, here's why we should consider this type of offer based on, you know, other other comps. I don't know that a lot of agents do that. And that is a, you know, a lot of agents are like, okay, Mr. or Mrs. a buyer. How much do you want to spend? Okay, maybe we can go a little bit over. And it's more of just like finessing like the feeling of the buyer, but not actually bringing the hard data saying we should offer X based on, I think that is a really great idea for anyone who's working with offers. Do your homework. You know, before you go to do an open house and I tell the agents on my team, as I always remind them, pull up a circle on MLS as to everything around the area that you're doing the open house at. Know your statistics. Know what else is out there. That house might not be right for them. You can easily get in the car after you're open house and take them to look at your, the other listings around the area. So just do your homework. And you probably also in the county that you serve and I know you work, you know, a lot of places in Connecticut. But I imagine you know what neighborhoods people like our starter neighborhoods, you know where they graduate to when, you know, where the best schools are. All of this is we're talking really about knowing the community, knowing the inventory, knowing kind of what's happening. How much time do you think you spend every day sort of checking in on those stats? I do it every night. So I luckily I was born with not needing a lot of sleep, which works great in my personal practice. I, when the world gets quiet, you know, 11 to 2am, I'm on the computer, I'm just checking numbers, I'm checking towns, seeing what's new, seeing, you know, sales. That's when I work the best. So I would say I do it every single night. But in the beginning of my career, I did two open houses every single Sunday, did that for years. That's how I built my, you know, my list of clientele. And I always, always went on back then, you know, we had a book that we used to flip through and see what the listings were around the area and know, and know the sales. So I was able to just hopefully answer a question that may have come up in an open house. So I think it's a good practice. If you get out of the practice, that's not good. Yeah, get back in. It's, yeah, doing open houses, it's, it just is the thing to do. And it's always the thing to do. And technology has not really changed it too much to where open houses seem to be still very effective. Have, it probably drives you crazy when you see newer agents not wanting to sit open houses on the weekends. I think if I was a new agent, that I would beg other agents to let me come to their open house. I would beg them. Right. I tell them all the time here. I'm giving it to you. I mean, people are, the people that are walking in the door, some are just doing this as a hobby, right? They just want to go and see a nice house. But most of them are coming because they have an interest in buying a piece of real estate. It might not be that piece of real estate. But you now have their information, you hopefully have a conversation and get up a, you know, repertoire with them and they'll call you when they're ready to buy real estate or you can be in touch with them. And I think the technology today, if you get their email, you know, if you just drip on them and drip on them eventually when they're ready to buy real estate, what was that REALTOR's name I met? And it's going to be right on the top of their, you know, their head. So I think it's really important to put yourself out there and rather that open house gym, the grocery store, you know, my family makes fun of me, but I never, I'll never walk out the door not in a matching outfit or having my hair look good or whatever because you're, are we selling yourself? So and branding, branding, branding, you know, put your name, put your name everywhere that you're, you know, that that's allowed. So yeah. Totally, totally agree. I think those are all amazing ideas and it's things I agree with personally as well. So sort of the irony of you not being, you know, a college grad but being ultra successful in real estate is you actually work a lot with Yale, which is in New Haven as well. So, you know, you work with a lot of the doctors at Yale, you work, I think with faculty as well. So let's, you know, this is something that I don't think we've ever talked to anyone about is, you know, being sort of a friend to the university where you get, you know, sort of known amongst, you know, the management there that you're a person that can help when professors come in and leave or when physicians come and leave at the hospital. So can you talk a little bit about how do you build, how did you build those relationships and how does that how does that work for you? So, you know, it's become a niche, you know, I think I've mentioned to you that one of my clients years ago named me REALTOR to the Docs and that becomes my hashtag REALTOR to the Docs and it's not only it's not the only people that I work with clearly, but it was, it was kind of an accident. It was probably about 25 years ago sold a house to a chief of a department that was coming in and it was going to be a struggle. They were wooing him from Harvard, so it took a while, negotiations take a while. It was probably a good year that every time they'd come to town, I'd show them houses, show them around, get to know the area, took them for pizza, and we obviously finally got into contract and he said to me like I promise you I'm going to be building a very big department here and that department I have moved my, I've moved my 49th doctor into that department from him in 25 years. Now, obviously those those sales turn into, they multiply because then one of those doctors has someone coming from UCLA that they just came from, let's say, and from another department and then they give my name to that department and then that starts spreading around to department. So right now I have three departments that I really could get fed a lot of business from from the chiefs directly. Now that's it's a lot of work. It's not just, oh here's a doctor and they you go out and you show them a house. It's, I get them sometimes on their second interview here and they still have maybe four interviews to go. But they want to see if they can afford to live in Connecticut. So I'll take them in the car. I'll spend a day and you know it's kind of a you know I'm driving them around and educating them on the areas and just driving by house and say you know here's approximately what this one would go for. So I really give them a full education out of maybe 10 doctors that I'll take in my car that they've given me maybe one or two of them lucky to take the position. So it's not so it's a lot of time. Yeah. It's a lot of time but it pays off because like I said they what I find is that you know I'm educating these very brilliant people on such a different level right. I'm not I'm certainly not saving lives but I'm changing lives and they don't have a lot of time. So they come to me kind of I'm a very good listener because I have to be. They tell me what they're looking for and then if there's something obviously not on the market now but when they're ready I'll use my resources. I I don't love cold calling but I'll do it a lot of times I'll call my list of clients that I've a massed over 39 years and say you know do you know anybody who's looking to sell in your neighborhood I have this great couple coming to Yale they'd be perfect. I do a lot of letter writing personal letter writing and just sometimes get an open listing just say you know just let me just show it to this one client and a lot of people don't want their house on the market and they're thrilled to do it and it just becomes a smooth transaction and but I think it's I think it's an interesting you know kind of niche I kind of call it where healthcare you know meets and real estate merge right it's that yeah and I just like I said it's you know I think it's teaching them they're so brilliant but they don't know anything about real estate. Sure. They don't know what a septic tank is. Their eyes light off when they realize like what actually goes into a septic tank. You know they don't understand financing they know what they make they know they can afford what they can afford but they don't understand you know 15 year versus a 30 year you know a fixed rate versus an arm so I love teaching them and and then you know like I said we kind of changed their lives quickly and I have to do it efficiently and move on. So I want to go back I want to go back to the open house sorry the the open listing idea because this was something that that stuck out as as you were mentioning so walk us through that because I don't know that everyone listening is going to understand what that means. So you know there in other areas not here you know they kind of pocket listings right there. Yeah sort of the same thing except that you know I will literally call someone in a neighborhood that I think it's perfect the house is perfect for and ask them you know would you be interested in selling. Here's what I think I could get you and you don't have to put your house on the market you don't have to clean it you don't have to you know pick your socks off the floor. Here's when they're going to be here let me bring them in and and it's simple and with COVID that was that was a gift to a lot of people who are so new to me. Who especially you know some of my doctors who obviously you know couldn't get sick and we just bring them into one house if it was perfect great we make the deal they're not as picky as someone that may have you know a no timeline you know they just they want they figure out what school system they want I always send them to like great schools dot org I let them do their own homework never steer anybody towards a school system because it's different for everybody you know somebody might be looking for a kid that's really strong in theater or really strong in math so you know I steer them to great schools dot org and then let them make their decision and then kind of pick out three towns and run. That's a great tip um the that that website for pushing that whole conversation off you know we could for ethics obviously we we can't really steer somebody towards a particular school but you can steer them towards the website and say do your own research. I have found in I just uh linkedin just told me I've been doing this for six years which I didn't realize um and I feel actually a little bit like god has been six years maybe maybe I need to hang it up but no I'm having too much fun doing it but um the reason I'm bringing that up is um gosh I don't know I just lost my train of thought oh no it was it was about um what I was reflecting on over the last six years sorry um so over the last six years I was thinking a lot about when I saw that I've been doing the six years I was like okay what are some of the common elements of some of these top producers and you just said something that I think is incredibly important and I think for someone like you is kind of just like that's what you do but I think a lot of filters don't do this what Susan basically just said was that she goes and finds her own inventory for her buying clients right she's not just scouring the MLS which of course she is doing that too she's like you know I'm gonna just uh the lava call over to sew and sew down the street because that's the perfect house for my client and I'm gonna see if they would be willing to sell I find that that is something that top REALTORS often will do and other agents just doesn't even occur to them they just look at the MLS that's what's there if it's not on there sorry can't help you I love that so you are literally I think it also depends I think it also depends on the age you know the the Gen Z's that don't like to make phone calls um I've been home out fun a lot in my career right a lot of doors get shut in your face keep going right just keep going the next door is open and um and just don't don't let it stop you yeah I think it's it's so important because people either you can wait for them to get ready to sell their home or you can proactively go to them and say here's what I think I can get you if you're interested and I know that everyone's got a price everyone's got a price for their home that they would be willing to move even if it's there forever home so you know if if you know I you know I might think I'm in my forever place now but if you came to me with a hundred percent return offer like that I would made a hundred percent on uh that's not my forever home anymore I'm gonna find something else so that is such a smart opening line for that is fill in the blank if I could get you X I yes you would sell your house right and fill in the blank and see what they say I love that you might you might be thinking that they're thinking here when they're really just thinking here yeah so um you know on a good example of that is I had somebody call me once for a donation and they asked me if I would and I it was an organization who was important to me but I had given to them before and I was planning on giving more that year that particular year and they called me and said just wondering if you would match your donation from last year Dom so I matched my donation they could have gotten double from me if their approach was different yeah that is really absolutely it's all in the presentation all in the presentation thank you for that is such a great great tip I I love that let's let's talk about presentation when you go into a listing presentation let's say for example and let's say it's not a instant slam donk it's not a past client it's it's you're you're in competition maybe with another agent how do you approach listing presentations and because obviously you win a lot of them so tell us about what you do in a listing presentation that you think maybe is a little different so interesting that you say that because the thing that you said that really stands out is what people think right oh this is slam donk what I tell anybody who will listen to me nothing is a slam donk if you're going on a listing presentation of your brother's house be prepared everybody is a client everybody deserves to get the best to make you know hopefully make a profit but everyone deserves to be treated exactly the same and I'll go back to that in a second just saying that you know I I think of common thread when I read some of my you know hundreds and hundreds of Google reviews is when people come back and they say you know she treated us like we were her only client and I think that's really important is that you give whether they're spending a hundred thousand or a hundred million it doesn't matter treat everybody the same because their house is their castle and so I try to do I like to do a two-step program not everyone will tell you it's the best way to do it but I like to go out the first time if I don't know the people I don't know the house give me a tour and I take notes tell me what you've done tell me what you love about living here and then I come back you know tell me I have to do my homework because I don't care how good you are you can't go out and tell someone a price of a house without seeing it it's impossible so to work and by the way I want to pause you for a second because it and I want you to keep going with this but this is what a consultant does a consultant goes into a company and says tell me about the company and then they go I'm going to come back and give you my findings so this is what we're talking about with the two-step process you're doing it very much like a consultant what right do your home you know go back do your homework and then come back and show them that's you know sometimes I'll talk about a little bit of my marketing on that first interview you know kind of what I do you know very quick they're always like well you know what's your commission you know well we're going to go over everything when I come back because there's so much more to tell you about what I'm going to do for you and it's always about what you're going to do for them you know and not for yourself and so I don't go in prepared to you know sign right here on the dotted line I may lose some I have gone out on a few in my career and where I'm called back you know the next day and they say oh we signed with someone to meet they that person was maybe just buying the listing they told him a really high number that sure you know that they wanted to hear and get him to sign on the dotted line I like to be realistic and otherwise they're going to call me every single day why hasn't my house sold so I like to do my homework and give them real facts and I'll never take more than 48 hours before I go back but I like to be prepared you know it's so funny because I've been talking to top producers I guess for six years now and they pretty much everyone you know has a similar sort of answer like like you were saying you know well not the two-step approach always but but doing your homework going in with you know information having a presentation and really having it very well practiced I suspect that is missing from a lot of REALTOR training I think a lot of agents don't get that sort of training of listing presentation buyer presentation you know how do you you know how are you extracting information how are you collecting that information and then how are you using that information to you know hopefully get the deal it is it is something that is a real art and a science I believe and something that you're obviously part so you're when you first go out there you're on like a more of a fact-finding mission you're like tell me about the home tell me about all the things that that you want or that you've done to the home and you collect all this information and then you go back you process it you put it through some some different metrics and then you're like okay here's what just like a consultant here's my report here's what we're going to do and I come back with a nice bound book and it is not just statistics about you know William Pitt's otherbies but you know and about me and what I've done but the marketing I bring them you know actual you know photos and show them the difference of here's a cell phone photo versus my professional photographer I have I'm not a good photographer so just because of that I've used a professional photographer for 20 years so that's important I think that people need to see it touch it feel it and I bring them this book show them here's what I'm going to do for you show them the advertising I show them you know where their house is going to appear how it's going to appear and then give them real facts here's the house that sold you know within your neighborhood oh well then why isn't my house worth that much well because they have a brand new kitchen and you know yours is from the 1970s I mean I don't say that but you know I try to give them the reasons as to why I think their house is worth what I think it's worth and then we talk about just the kind of the art of pricing right not just that 99 cent pricing you know the ending with the 99 sure but I have always sort of said you know it's really important to let the buyer perceive a value you to me you cast a wider net the wider your net the more people that come in the more people that come in the more offers you're going to get the more offers you're going to get the higher your price is going to be so I think that's coming on you know right here's your market value let's come on under your market value let's cast that wider net and you know you're kind of like walk into a department store right that that lost leader at the end of the aisle it got you to get into the store and then you're going to spend more that's what we want we want more people to walk in we need the traffic to get your price up so I think it's just important to tell them all aspects about marketing I think so too and there is this psychological principle called escalation of commitment so what Susan's basically saying is hey maybe it's smarter to price it slightly under under market value so that we have more people competing and the reason why that's significant for human beings is we are wired to as we agree to something as we want to continue to agree to something so that's what's called escalation of commitment you guys can google it but it's basically a psychological principle it says the more as you continue to say yes to something you you become more and more committed it's harder actually to pull out so in other words if you're going back and forth with somebody on pricing you know there's multiple offers there's bids it's actually more likely that those two people will continue to battle it out versus one person saying I'm leaving so it's actually a really smart play because it plays into our human nature of wanting something and wanting to compete and and win and achieve which is built into us so that's a really smart idea is get a lot of people interested in the property and then you can you know have them all battle it out right exactly and I think also back to that kind of two step I think that the other idea behind it is it gives you time if you don't know the people give you time to maybe maybe make a connection right now you you can go down a rabbit hole certainly on social media and figure out who they might know or you know find out oh they used to work for this company you know oh did you did you work with so-and-so and you know it's about oh gosh 35 years ago I think I had a marketing company look at all these notes I had received in the five years I had been in business a beautiful thank you notes from my clients and they came up with a tagline and it's real trust real care in real estate and that's what they came up with after looking at all of that I care about people I really I really truly care about them I have a baby shower of a client I'm going to in a couple of weeks I've been invited to weddings and bar mitzvahs and barbecues and that's a testament to me just fostering my relationships with people but I like my physicians maybe I'm just a you know I should have been a doctor in my other life if I ever wanted to go to college I love medicine I'm fascinated by it and making them my friends has not only you know it's been great because I get to learn but obviously it's helped in my career because they just continue to refer me and refer me and it's all this business if you want to stay in a long term it's just all about relationships and I have a team that I started about 10 years ago only two people on it I don't want more a very different team I kind of you know I say it's like one plus one plus one equals three you know putting our ideas and thoughts together and also putting our volume together just makes us greater you know it's small team but number one small team in Connecticut means a lot more than just an individual person and absolutely unique people you know everyone's different again fostering relationships one of the girls has been with me about 10 years she's a marathon runner great connections right she's out there selling herself all of the time obviously it made up a t-shirt so it says the Susan Santoro team but then in the back in big letters down her back says REALTOR let someone come up and ask her a question while she's out running or at the end of a marathon tap into that right one of the other girls has been with me about four years she's a mom of three kids that is your perfect audience get involved with their sports get involved with their you know PTA so you know I love to be able to problem solve with them love tree I would have teach them how to tap into their resources and go through your index cards and call people Q4 I said I'm not a goal setter in the beginning Q4 is my very favorite quarter because I like to look and see how much I could actually accomplish in Q4 so I go through my address book and I reach out to as many clients as I possibly can in a week that's amazing you know that is a great idea because most people step off the gas and Q4 you know we have the holidays we have family stuff week it's the best but you you step on the gas absolutely it's my it's my very favorite time and I like to see like what can I accomplish between now and then so and again I don't set myself a number goal but you know well sometimes it's just as simple as an email you know hey drove by your house today love the new color of your front door or you know pick up a phone you know was thinking about you know or look on look on Facebook right see how old their kids are now have a reason to call them fostering relationships is key if you want to stay long term in this business it's definitely the key to my success and thank god for social media in the sense that we now do get information about our clients if we're following them and we get to enjoy their lives as they post about it and it like Susan like you just said I get to call hey I just saw you on a trip to cancun hope it was great it's it's the perfect reason to pick up the phone and not have to do a sales pitch on oh by the way you know I you know it because you that can always come up naturally as well but I want to I want to go back to something you said that I think is really critical and I think it comes through is care and trust what you're really doing is because I believe that care and trust are earned not automatically given and you have a huge an amazing history of constantly demonstrating care and trust and therefore that when you know it's funny that you're niche one of your niches is doctors because I think I think the same way when I choose a doctor for myself a physician I the only thing I really really it's most important to me is that do I think this physician cares about me even just a little bit if they care about me I'm good if I feel that they don't care about then I'm I'm gonna look for another doctor so I use that same principle when I when I'm going to to see a doctor I want I want I want them to actually care about me people want the same thing obviously in a REALTOR in any in any service position so I think that is is such an important thing is demonstrating care and trust is really should be a if if people are gonna set goals I think that's a heck of a good goal to set is I want everyone of my clients to go you know Susan cares about me or DJ cares about me or whatever that that is worth its weight in goal absolutely now what are what do you do to stay in touch with clients in between transactions because of course people you know buy their home and maybe they don't move forever or for 10 years or what are we doing to stay in touch and make sure they don't forget about you anniversary cards happy anniversary right some people are like oh my gosh I can't believe it in this house seven years because you forget right you forget how long you've been in it so I'll always write in the card how long sometimes I'll you know write little personal notes thanks giving I don't do Christmas I don't do Hanukkah I don't sometimes I'll do New Year's thanks giving thanks giving card it's a great time to say thank you you're just as exactly what you're saying thank you for your referrals even if they've never given you one they may have thought that they've mentioned your name it may not have panned out but you're thanking them I do send a gift I I can't talk about you know what it is because you're not supposed to but I do send a gift to every client who does give me a referral after closing and and they're so appreciative of it and very surprised when they get it and and then they like the idea of getting this gift and so then they try to give you more so one of my departments at Yale there's two girls who are in competition to see who and they keep calling me who's given you more referrals this year so it's actually become like this very funny game but I'm I like I said I do that Q4 I do spend a lot of time I have an I have a mold fashion right I have an index box with all of my client's names on an individual card and they're in each month of when they bought it makes it easy I'm obviously I have it on computer also but I'm visual so I go through that card box and I'll start calling you know just checking in sending a note like I said send an email there's so many things that you can do you do get hit up I'm not going to tell you don't for donations you know kids ad blocks or you know will you buy a pie or buy a candy I do I always buy any when it comes to me it says they want you know trying to self-food I buy it and bring it down to the Ronald McDonald House because it's a very unfortunately a full house all the time so I'll always drop stuff there but so yeah you do get hit up you do have to go out for drinks or dinner or lunch once in a while I don't mind it again I love to learn things from people so it just goes back to that being a good listener and you just if you just quiet for a minute and just listen to somebody else you're gonna gain something that's going to be momentous for you it's just gonna change things for you they might not realize that they're telling you about their neighbor who is going into a retirement home they just might mention that not thinking about business I heard that I'm going back to my office I look up that neighbor's name and I write that neighbor a letter and I keep in touch and I keep sending letters until that neighbor calls me for a listing point so good good listening just be a good listener be a good listener and be inquisitive like ask lots of questions about someone else's life right like know what is going on because home and life is connected right where they're intricate they're obviously interchangeable you know your life in your home is is really one thing and so being in touch with what's going on in your clients lives and listening as you mentioned allows you to just learn about what other opportunities may exist that they might not have even thought as an opportunity for you they're just sharing you know parts of their life right and I think you know the other thing is don't make it about yourself very simply I'm just coming to mind quickly you sent me an email two days ago and I had a nutty day and I actually was traveling back from Chicago visiting my family and and then had a crazy day just hit the ground running so instead of writing you an email saying you know I'm sorry right I'm sorry is about me and you probably don't realize this but I wrote you and just said thanks for your patience now I've made it about you yes so it's very important to realize none of this is about me me me you know there's lots of agents out there who are going to post every day you know I'm the best I'm the greatest and there there's enough business to go around that some people want to deal with people like that that's fine but I tried to I want to make it about you make it about the client what can I do for you not what it's going to do for me and make me number one that will come just make it about make it about your client yeah demonstrate care and trust it just it all it all goes back to that this this accountability thing too is is acknowledging thank you for your patience you know if if you you know we're delayed on a on a response or an email thank you so much for your patience here's the answer that you're looking for exactly absolutely brilliant versus saying I'm sorry DJ sorry DJ it's not about DJ it's about telling the client hey you're time I kept waiting right yeah I kept you waiting yes I am sorry about that but I I acknowledge what you have you that's a really smart smart idea we have care real trust in real estate it's my tagline actually I should if I you know I want it someday maybe I'll get a tattoo someday but but it is it's a motto that I live by how important is it to have a niche to read whether it's you know you're you know you work with doctors you work with with faculty at Yale obviously you have you know other clients as well but how important is it to have a specialty like just like doctors have specialties I think nowadays I guess if I was to get into the business again you know if I was new I would try to focus more on that I think there's a lot of people who have made that really their success you know the you know the you know waterfront specialist or that this specialist I think you know I can't really call being a REALTOR to the docs by my niche but I guess it just what I sell you know myself in is just the time that I can dedicate to them like sometimes they don't even realize what time it is especially the ones in training you know they're doing the residency here they're in surgery they get out two in the morning and they're sitting down and they might be looking online to see all the stuff that I you know sent to them to look at today all the new listings and they don't even think twice they'll start texting me yeah and sometimes I'll surprise them and answer them at two-third year three in the morning um you know other times I won't and you know try to say okay I get a little respect of time but um but I think that that's you know really important I pay attention to them and so I think that that's sort of the niche thing again came about kind of by accident like that but that's when people come to me and they say oh doctor so and so recommend you I'm gonna be you know I'm coming in in the neurology department um great you know and they said yeah I was told that you never sleep so it's like it's become a joke but they love that that I can dedicate so much time to them a lot of times people are they're texting or calling me even on WhatsApp because they're coming from another country and I'm able to you know talk to them at crazy hours so I think depending on what your your niche is um you can really hone in on it I just interviewed with another department at Yale I'm not gonna mention them by name and the chief sent me a nice note the other day and said you know we'd like to take you on as as our REALTOR if you don't mind we're interviewing if you don't mind we're interviewing a few people next week you know that we're gonna have you take out terrific so you know it's another department so again it's no one's paying me to do this so you don't get paid until you're sitting at a closing and I think that goes back to that drive of waking up unemployed every day you know we don't make a dime till you're sitting at a closing and don't forget that the deal doesn't end when you write the contract and it gets accepted there's so much more to it you you want to be able to give somebody my kids a lot of a treat today oh you know we're new in the area we don't know anybody you know do you have a pediatric a pediatric ortho you can give us so sure you know that's what you want you want that you want to be that person that they come to for the name of a restaurant anything so I think that that's really important that just don't let the deal end actually write the contract yeah it's so you boy you said you said a lot uh just there and a lot of really really great stuff um I could not agree with you more I think it's super imperative that people think about you know the kind of uh relationships they want to have with their clients and to think well what do I have to do to earn that relationship what do I have to do to earn somebody saying something like oh this person cares about me my my REALTOR likes uh actually is is invested you know in my happiness um like if they can say that they're gonna sing your names the pray you know they're gonna scre sing it from the mountaintops um to everyone else the other thing too is you know thinking about niches and you're talking about working with physicians is you probably just by being around them you've studied kind of what physicians are like what their needs are um you know obviously everybody's different but they have commonality I'm sure there's certain needs uh and and you have just been a student of of you know whatever departments you've worked in to where I suspect you're almost thinking you almost think of yourself almost as an employee even of some of these uh you know other departments and some of the doctors that you come and think I am um you know and they think I'm working for the hospital or the university and um you know sometimes I have to if I if comes off you know explain that I'm not and you know here's how I got here's how you got to me um but you know it's uh again just relationship building and caring caring caring so um I'm today in fact I'm just as I'm talking to you I just got a an alert just popped up on my computer a client who I sold a house two three years ago in the military and um was given my name from another REALTOR who follows me online sold them a house you know not too far from here they've been doing a lot of work to the house they reached out to media of a plumber a given electrician so they sent me a note last week and said you know we'd love to have you over um to show you what we've done to the house and most REALTORS would be like if they're not selling you know I'm not gonna go over and it is going to take up an hour and a half of my time today um and they may alarm just went off just reminding me that that's where I'm going today at four o'clock so you know it yes it's it's 45 minutes there it's 45 minutes back I'll probably sit there and you know visit with them for an hour and a half okay but three hours of time if their neighbor decides to sell their house who's gonna be on the top of their head yes so you've got to just take the time to do stuff like that and um I'm excited to see what they've done to the house and I really truly do care but that's that's that's the whole point is that you are happy to and it's not always easy to drive 45 minutes each way it's not easy but you're excited to do it and it's what ultimately demonstrates care and compassion and I I'm in this I'm a professional and I want to see this all the way through

to be putting her condo up for sale in Florida really okay on the east coast oh great where and we just start talking again it was just conversation I said I have a great REALTOR there oh I didn't
