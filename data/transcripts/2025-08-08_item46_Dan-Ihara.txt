[00:01:13] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:17] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:21] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:22] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:24] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:28] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:30] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:32] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:34] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:38] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:41] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:45] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:48] and I've hired over 2,000 agents.
[00:01:50] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:53] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:55] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:01:58] for each agent in your market
[00:02:00] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:03] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:05] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:08] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:10] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:11] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:14] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:18] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:19] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:21] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:24] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,

[00:04:04] Today on the show, my guest is Dan Ahara from who is the founder
[00:04:10] and the CEO of the Ahara team.
[00:04:12] Let me tell you more about Dan.
[00:04:14] He is the number one Keller Williams team in Hawaii in Oahu.
[00:04:18] The leader of the Keller Williams real estate planner for nearly two decades.
[00:04:22] Dan has consistently ranked among the top 100 teams nationally.

[00:05:19] He is a team leader.
[00:05:21] He is a superstar top 1% REALTOR in Oahu.
[00:05:24] Dan, welcome to the show.
[00:05:27] Thank you and Aloha.
[00:05:29] Aloha and I think I may have so called you Don earlier,
[00:05:32] so I apologize if I did that.
[00:05:33] But Dan, you are Dan.
[00:05:36] Dan, tell me the best piece of advice you ever heard in real estate.
[00:05:41] Gosh, there are so many pieces of advice that I got.
[00:05:44] I think one of the main principles of who we are and what we do today is
[00:05:50] the world of real estate, we're told to have a script to tell people.
[00:05:56] And then I learned that maybe it should be a flip on its head
[00:06:00] where we should be asking them questions.
[00:06:02] So I became a questionologist, DJ.
[00:06:05] I don't know if you know that, but people like me work questionologists.
[00:06:09] We study and use questions in our practice.
[00:06:13] I love that.
[00:06:14] More of a listener and a more of a consultant, right?
[00:06:18] A consultant's approach is more question focused
[00:06:22] and letting the client tell you everything
[00:06:26] that they are looking for versus you telling them,
[00:06:29] how you are so amazing.
[00:06:30] And you are so amazing.
[00:06:31] And but we want to hear your story first.
[00:06:34] So before we get into your process, let's tell your story.
[00:06:38] You are from Oahu, originally?
[00:06:40] I live in, I was born and raised on Oahu.
[00:06:43] My father was a Colonel in the Army,
[00:06:45] so I left when I was five and I came back when I was 15.
[00:06:48] We traveled around the country as an electric brat.
[00:06:52] And I saw 40 of the 50 states by the time I was 14.
[00:06:56] I came back to Hawaii.
[00:06:58] I went to University of Hawaii here and decided to stay
[00:07:02] because I saw the rest of the country
[00:07:03] and I realized this is the most beautiful place in the planet.
[00:07:06] So I-
[00:07:07] No argument there.
[00:07:09] Yeah, I got in the surfing at 15 years old
[00:07:11] and I never turned back.
[00:07:13] 62 now, I've been surfing for a really long time.
[00:07:18] Amazing.
[00:07:19] Yeah.
[00:07:19] And Oahu had the longboard surfing.
[00:07:23] That was sort of what became really popular
[00:07:25] or maybe that was out in Maui.
[00:07:27] I'm not sure.
[00:07:27] But that was Hawaii had longboard surfing,
[00:07:30] which I know was very,
[00:07:32] was not what was happening over on the California coast.
[00:07:36] Yeah, well, actually it was born in Hawaii surfing
[00:07:38] and it was brought to the California coast.
[00:07:41] But yeah, I've been surfing for a long time.
[00:07:43] I ride a shortboard and a longboard.
[00:07:46] I have only two goals in life, DJ.
[00:07:48] It's one is to watch every sunrise and sunset until I die
[00:07:52] and the second is to surf every day until I can't.
[00:07:56] And I ask my wife, I have a board meeting every day.
[00:08:00] I love that.
[00:08:02] And you've still managed to find the time to close
[00:08:04] a lot of real estate sales.
[00:08:08] And you are a listing agent predominantly.
[00:08:10] Your team you guys focused about 70% of your business
[00:08:13] is on listings 30% on buy side.
[00:08:17] Let's talk about how you got started.
[00:08:19] How did you get into the business?
[00:08:20] Sure. Well, I used to sell waterproof cameras
[00:08:23] around the world.
[00:08:24] So I took the belt of the globe and I
[00:08:28] prospected that world,
[00:08:29] which was quite a big larger world.
[00:08:32] So I traveled a lot.
[00:08:33] And my wife, we had three kids at the time
[00:08:36] and she said maybe you ought to stay home
[00:08:37] so they know your name.
[00:08:40] I decided I needed to find a job to stay home.
[00:08:43] And I met a guy that was in real estate
[00:08:45] and he introduced me to it.
[00:08:47] And I took a class at the University of Hawaii
[00:08:50] and I did well and I really enjoyed it.
[00:08:52] I thought, home, maybe I could do this.
[00:08:54] It was either this or pharmaceuticals.
[00:08:57] So something real estate, some drugs.
[00:08:59] I picked those days.
[00:09:01] Well, at least it would keep you home.
[00:09:04] Like selling pharmaceuticals,
[00:09:05] you may have had to travel the states again.
[00:09:09] And because the pharmaceutical companies
[00:09:11] are not located in Hawaii, I'm assuming.
[00:09:13] So yeah.
[00:09:14] So you started doing that and how did you begin
[00:09:17] to develop your business?
[00:09:18] What did you do that you maybe I'm sure
[00:09:21] you've seen lots of agents come and go?
[00:09:23] What were you doing differently?
[00:09:24] So for me, it's always been mindset.
[00:09:28] I've been a serial entrepreneur on my life
[00:09:30] since I was an out of college.
[00:09:31] I built businesses.
[00:09:32] And when I got into real estate,
[00:09:34] I had one mantra was,
[00:09:35] I want to be the best REALTOR on the planet.
[00:09:37] Just this planet.
[00:09:39] No other planet.
[00:09:40] Right?
[00:09:40] And so I asked myself,
[00:09:42] well, how do I become the best REALTOR on the planet?
[00:09:44] And I said, well, I needed to learn contract.
[00:09:46] So I studied the contract back in front.
[00:09:49] And I mastered it.
[00:09:50] I knew every provision.
[00:09:52] And I knew different perspectives of it.
[00:09:54] I learned properties.
[00:09:56] I went to every broker's open.
[00:09:58] I met prop.
[00:09:59] I learned neighborhoods.
[00:09:59] I didn't even know.
[00:10:01] Then I met agents.
[00:10:02] I got to good.
[00:10:03] I got them to like me.
[00:10:05] 
[00:10:06] And then I realized that,
[00:10:08] well, I needed to find the right client.
[00:10:10] So who has the most real estate?
[00:10:12] And I was sitting on the beach with my brother
[00:10:14] who was doing reverse mortgages at the time.
[00:10:17] And he said, Dan, there's this huge wave
[00:10:18] of this silver tsunami that's coming.
[00:10:21] And this is, remember, 20 years ago.
[00:10:23] And these people are going to have a lot of problems.
[00:10:26] They're going to have to leave their home.
[00:10:27] And they need, they need some help.
[00:10:29] But there's no REALTOR.
[00:10:30] They're wealth transfers.
[00:10:31] What you're talking about.
[00:10:31] Right.
[00:10:32] Right.
[00:10:32] The big wealth transfer.
[00:10:33] Well, 20 years ago, nobody really talked about that.
[00:10:36] My brother was already on it.
[00:10:37] My brother Percy.
[00:10:39] And so I really owe it to him because he really
[00:10:42] encouraged me to focus on this market
[00:10:45] where they had wealth and the head wealth and real estate.
[00:10:49] Then he said to me, then you should educate people
[00:10:51] on the value of using it.
[00:10:54] And so I'm six months into being a REALTOR.
[00:10:56] I committed to the newspaper for you, young folks.
[00:11:00] It's this big piece of paper that we would open up and look at.
[00:11:04] That's what it is on it.
[00:11:06] And stories.
[00:11:06] Yeah.
[00:11:06] Yeah, words and pictures and things.
[00:11:08] Yeah.
[00:11:08] And people actually paid that haven't nailed to you.
[00:11:11] Well, back in those days,
[00:11:12] by the way, we still do the newspaper.
[00:11:17] The circulation was large and older adults looked at it.
[00:11:22] And so then I started teaching classes on month six
[00:11:27] of being a licensed REALTOR.
[00:11:29] You had no business teaching classes at month six.
[00:11:32] What did I love it?
[00:11:33] Yeah.
[00:11:33] And educating them on best practice.
[00:11:35] How to buy a home in today's market.
[00:11:37] How to sell a home today's market.
[00:11:38] That was as simple as it is.
[00:11:39] So you were an educator.
[00:11:41] I've always been an educator.
[00:11:43] My father traveled around the country and taught us.
[00:11:46] But you want to learn and grow.
[00:11:48] And how do you learn and grow?
[00:11:49] Well, by asking a lot of questions.
[00:11:51] 
[00:11:52] So over time, I became this questionologist.
[00:11:55] Right.
[00:11:56] I want to pause you just for a quick second
[00:11:58] because what you're saying is actually quite profound
[00:12:00] where we're talking about a newer agent six months in.
[00:12:04] Certainly doesn't have the knowledge, the skill set,
[00:12:08] the experience.
[00:12:10] But what he can do or what you did is you created a program to teach.
[00:12:17] And you started teaching it.
[00:12:18] What that instantly does is it almost eliminates the issue
[00:12:22] of your young and don't know what you're doing.
[00:12:26] And nobody's going to ask you at this point.
[00:12:28] Oh, you've only been in the six months
[00:12:30] because you're teaching a class.
[00:12:32] And by doing that, it bypasses the whole.
[00:12:35] I wonder how long this guy's been in the business
[00:12:37] because you are now seen as an authority figure.
[00:12:39] And a knowledge was I've never really thought of it before like that.
[00:12:43] And I thought, and I just,
[00:12:44] what you were telling me that my marketing brain went
[00:12:46] while that was really, really smart.
[00:12:48] Because now people will see you as this important person
[00:12:51] who certainly must know what he's doing.
[00:12:54] Yeah.
[00:12:54] And then I started finding out that there was this huge wave
[00:12:59] of people that needed to leave their home.
[00:13:01] But they didn't know where to go.
[00:13:03] So I started a class called senior living options.
[00:13:07] Where do I go if I can't stay home?
[00:13:09] How much does it cost?
[00:13:10] What does life look like?
[00:13:10] Who can help me?
[00:13:11] How do I get to?
[00:13:12] So I solved all of their questions that they had
[00:13:15] because I researched it all.
[00:13:17] And that's what we have in our community,
[00:13:20] KW Real Estate Planner.
[00:13:21] I teach three months of senior relocation
[00:13:23] of how do you find this demographic?
[00:13:26] How do you serve it?
[00:13:28] What are the problems that you can solve?
[00:13:30] If you think about everything that I've done,
[00:13:33] DJs, I've identified a problem.
[00:13:35] And then I provided a solution to their problem.
[00:13:39] And when I provided the solution,
[00:13:41] they hired me with that solution.
[00:13:43] Dan, was anyone else as a REALTOR focused on senior reloc?
[00:13:47] I can't imagine.
[00:13:49] I've done this podcast for seven years, 700 episodes.
[00:13:52] You are the very first person I have ever talked to.
[00:13:56] Who's the one who's the last question?
[00:13:56] Yeah, no, back in those days, nobody did.
[00:13:58] And even till today, there are a couple of companies
[00:14:01] that are trying to follow suit.
[00:14:03] And they don't have their level of success.
[00:14:06] We really mastered it.
[00:14:08] We, one of the things that we learned is,
[00:14:10] we don't know where to go.
[00:14:11] So I researched it and I got to know everybody.
[00:14:14] In our market, there was only seven retirement communities.
[00:14:17] There's two types of retirement community models.
[00:14:20] And so I can tell them how much it costs,
[00:14:22] where to go, what does life look like?
[00:14:24] How do I get there?
[00:14:25] I solved those problems for them.
[00:14:27] But then I found out their biggest problem is not only where to go,
[00:14:31] it's, what do I do with all my stuff?
[00:14:33] Yeah.
[00:14:34] So they were trapped in their home by the personal belongings
[00:14:36] they brought into their own home and then made them stuck in their home.
[00:14:40] Yeah.
[00:14:40] So then I looked around for companies that would help them clear it out.
[00:14:43] And there weren't any.
[00:14:44] So I started my own.
[00:14:46] It's called Senior Move Managers and Decletter Hawaii.
[00:14:50] Where I hired my niece, she would come in and she would,
[00:14:53] with our team of people, help them cleanse the home.
[00:14:55] Make them feel comfortable with moving.
[00:14:58] Take all their things, put it into their new home, set it up.
[00:15:02] And then we'd go back and clear out the house and sell it.
[00:15:05] And that was the magic sauce.
[00:15:07] So there was a retirement community that came new into our market.
[00:15:11] They had 180 units in this building.
[00:15:14] The, it was a CCRC.
[00:15:15] You know what a CCRC is?
[00:15:16] No.
[00:15:17] Continuing care retirement community.
[00:15:20] This is a life care guarantee system where they pay anywhere from
[00:15:24] 400 to 800,000 dollars just to get the key.
[00:15:28] Then they pay another six to 8,000 dollars a month for the care and service
[00:15:32] for the rest of their life.
[00:15:34] Guess what?
[00:15:35] That's where the wealthy go.
[00:15:36] Sure.
[00:15:36] So I found out what happens when people with money can't stay home.
[00:15:42] And I, I brought that solution to the market.
[00:15:45] And I've been doing these seminars for gosh, I was 20 years now.
[00:15:49] Senior, senior living options was the name of the title.
[00:15:53] And then I changed it because one of my competitors
[00:15:56] took my exact same title.
[00:15:58] I can't believe that, right?
[00:15:59] Really pissed me off.
[00:16:00] But it was okay.
[00:16:01] Then I changed it to planning for the future and beyond.
[00:16:04] Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery they say, right?
[00:16:09] Or we just call it theft.
[00:16:10] But either way, either way, Dan, what you're talking about is
[00:16:15] really, really brilliant for obvious reasons.
[00:16:18] Everyone listening, you know, is probably their draws.
[00:16:22] Hopefully is open is mine.
[00:16:24] Because what we're talking about is a need that every family has at a point.
[00:16:30] You know, the elder members of the family now have to figure out
[00:16:34] where they're going to sunset and where they're going to spend the rest of their lives.
[00:16:40] And this is a big family decision.
[00:16:42] There isn't a lot of guidance around this.
[00:16:44] I know families now they come together.
[00:16:47] They figure out what are we going to do with mom and dad?
[00:16:49] Where are they going to go?
[00:16:50] What communities are available to them?
[00:16:53] And what's the cost?
[00:16:55] Is there a long-term care insurance?
[00:16:56] All of those things.
[00:16:58] So I suspect that you probably partner with other providers as well.
[00:17:04] I'm assuming a state planners,
[00:17:06] financial planners, things like that.
[00:17:08] Yeah.
[00:17:09] So then my next question to myself was,
[00:17:11] who do the wealthy go to if they have a question regarding their home?
[00:17:16] Well, that was exactly it.
[00:17:17] They're going to, first thing they're going to do is they're going to go to their financial planner
[00:17:20] to see if they have enough money.
[00:17:24] Second is they're going to go to their CPA to see if there's any tax associated to the sale.
[00:17:30] And what we should talk about capital gains set because that's a big part of our business.
[00:17:34] And then the third is they're going to go maybe potentially talk to their attorney as well
[00:17:39] to see if there's any challenge with what's in the trust and what they're planning on doing.
[00:17:44] And so those are the people that I started calling.
[00:17:48] I didn't call clients.
[00:17:49] I called people that had people.
[00:17:53] So I went to go get the bird dogs.
[00:17:55] I wanted to talk to somebody that could get me 10 properties, not just one.
[00:18:01] And it worked.
[00:18:03] To a point where I now just did, I think it was in January,
[00:18:08] a continuing education class for the financial planners association of Hawaii.
[00:18:15] And now I'm asked to speak around the country to the financial planners associations of America.
[00:18:21] Because people have wealth in many areas, stock, bonds, Bitcoin, all the liquid assets.
[00:18:27] Then they have wealth in real estate.
[00:18:29] So the question is who plans real estate?
[00:18:31] Nobody does.
[00:18:33] Yeah, you're right.
[00:18:33] Hence we started the community called KW real estate planner, where we actually create design
[00:18:39] and pre-inheritance plans, ways to keep money in your pocket, prevent family disputes.
[00:18:46] Because DJ 70% of families are fighting over real estate after their parents pass away.
[00:18:52] 70%.
[00:18:53] And the biggest reason for that is you can't divide real estate.
[00:18:57] You see, what happens is if you've got wealth, you're going to build a trust.
[00:19:01] And the trust says, upon my demise, my kids share it.
[00:19:05] How do you share real estate?
[00:19:08] You can't.
[00:19:09] Hence 70% of families are reacting to a situation where maybe one's living there, the other's
[00:19:16] aren't.
[00:19:17] And you really think it's really touchy with people.
[00:19:20] If someone have sentimental, hold sentimental value and don't want to sell, others want to sell,
[00:19:26] it's not money that you can just divvy up.
[00:19:28] 
[00:19:28] Well, and it's a lot of money.
[00:19:30] I mean, we're not talking, you know, five or ten bucks.
[00:19:33] This is millions of dollars they're talking about.
[00:19:36] Real money that they never believe they could have a part of, but now it's real and it's on the
[00:19:41] table. And now the judge has gone.
[00:19:44] Mom and dad's gone.
[00:19:45] Now all the hurts and offences of the history and the past come to the service when they're
[00:19:51] trying to get what they believe is their fair share.
[00:19:54] And that's why plans need to be happened.
[00:19:56] And so I do pre-inheritance plans for families.
[00:20:01] Plans such as their families never fight.
[00:20:03] Plans to bless their family while they're alive.
[00:20:06] And also plans to prevent capital gains tax from touching their life.
[00:20:11] Let's talk about capital gains tax.
[00:20:13] That is a huge topic right now in, you know, in America.
[00:20:20] What's going on with capital gains and what are you doing to help your clients protect themselves?
[00:20:26] Well, number one, we're asking the question.
[00:20:29] So for those in the audience, my challenge to you is to understand what capital gains tax is.
[00:20:35] See, I travel all over the country and I ask the simple question.
[00:20:39] Tell me who knows cost basis.
[00:20:42] And people don't even know cost basis.
[00:20:44] Well, if they don't know cost basis, you don't know capital gains tax.
[00:20:47] Right.
[00:20:48] Because it starts with the basis, right?
[00:20:50] Yeah.
[00:20:50] And the basis is really the value that you purchase it at or the value of the date of transfer.
[00:20:56] Yeah.
[00:20:56] And that's the sticky part.
[00:20:58] Because if it was transferred prior to death, you have a carry over in cost basis.
[00:21:04] If it's transferred after death, you get a step up in cost basis.
[00:21:09] And people don't even understand that.
[00:21:10] Realters around the country don't really understand that.
[00:21:15] And so that's why I'm on an national platform to change the way REALTOR show up.
[00:21:20] And I'm challenging you to ask the simple question.
[00:21:22] When you go to a list in the appointment, do you understand what your capital gains tax
[00:21:26] liability is when you sell real estate?
[00:21:29] Because nobody asked that question.
[00:21:30] That's a great question.
[00:21:32] Nope.
[00:21:32] Nobody asked that question.
[00:21:33] Or you know why that is?
[00:21:35] I've realized why that is.
[00:21:36] Number one, industry doesn't teach us that.
[00:21:39] Number two, it doesn't impact our money.
[00:21:43] So why are you asking questions that doesn't impact you?
[00:21:46] Well, if you really care about the client,
[00:21:47] if you're going to be a true advocate and consultant
[00:21:50] or a real estate wealth advisor like I am,
[00:21:53] you're going to ask that question.
[00:21:55] And you're going to calculate it for him.
[00:21:57] And you're going to know what that looks like prior to even showing up.
[00:22:00] And really what you're doing too,
[00:22:02] this falls under the umbrella fiduciary, right?
[00:22:06] And so, although not expected to do,
[00:22:10] but certainly something that will provide not only value to the consumer,
[00:22:15] but also will establish you as their key partner throughout the entire
[00:22:21] the length, the time that they're in that home.
[00:22:24] So I love that idea.
[00:22:26] It almost cements you as the person as you start to,
[00:22:30] by the way, as you're moving in, let's talk about capital gains.
[00:22:33] Yeah, yeah.
[00:22:34] You know, clients call me the advisor now.
[00:22:37] They don't call me a REALTOR.
[00:22:38] Yeah.
[00:22:39] And that's a big difference.
[00:22:40] Huge.
[00:22:42] Because there's lots of REALTOR's out there.
[00:22:43] There's not a lot of advisors.
[00:22:45] No, no.
[00:22:46] And what's really cool about this is I get at least three levels of clients.
[00:22:50] Right?
[00:22:51] I got the parents, the children, and the grandparents.
[00:22:54] Why?
[00:22:54] Because we're creating plans sometimes for generation skipping trust.
[00:22:58] We're passing on real wealth, like significant wealth.
[00:23:03] And that's where our focus has been.
[00:23:06] Wow.
[00:23:07] So you really take a holistic approach to managing,
[00:23:12] you know, the real estate portion,
[00:23:15] but you have partners or businesses to assist with the other aspects of it,
[00:23:20] a state planning, financial planning,
[00:23:24] tax, all of that.
[00:23:26] Yeah.
[00:23:27] Yeah.
[00:23:27] I do three classes in my market.
[00:23:30] One is called senior living options.
[00:23:32] The other is avoiding capital gain tax and transferring real estate.
[00:23:36] Well, and the third is I'm a trustee now.
[00:23:39] What?
[00:23:40] And they're all designed to provide information to the wealthy that they need.
[00:23:45] See, think of it this way.
[00:23:48] Every wealthy person has a trust, right?
[00:23:50] To protect it from probing.
[00:23:52] Sure.
[00:23:52] But then the question is, is well, what happens when you're gone?
[00:23:57] And they said, I don't know, the trust takes care of it.
[00:23:59] So oh, I asked them so really?
[00:24:00] So tell me what it says.
[00:24:02] I said, well, I don't know what it says.
[00:24:03] I said, well, I can tell you what it says.
[00:24:05] Because I've seen thousands of these.
[00:24:07] And very few have a timeframe on it.
[00:24:09] What it says is upon your demise, your kids share it.
[00:24:13] So let me ask you, are all your kids alike?
[00:24:16] Do they think alike?
[00:24:17] Do they act alike?
[00:24:18] Are they in the same economic phase of life?
[00:24:21] So if the answer is no to any of those questions,
[00:24:23] you're likely going to be a statistic.
[00:24:26] Or do you have a plan such that when you're gone, your kids will love each other forever.
[00:24:33] That doesn't sound like a REALTOR does it.
[00:24:35] No.
[00:24:36] And some people ask me, oh, but I need to sell real estate.
[00:24:39] Can you help me too?
[00:24:40] Yeah, I can do that as well.
[00:24:41] Because they don't consider me like everybody else.
[00:24:44] Yeah, you're not a REALTOR.
[00:24:45] 
[00:24:46] No, I'm much more than that.
[00:24:48] A real estate wealth advisor.
[00:24:51] Wow, well, Dan, that is, it's really quite a profound paradigm shift.
[00:24:58] I'm a bit aghast at this.
[00:25:02] And the professionalism that you, you, you, you,
[00:25:06] you emote is very impressive.
[00:25:08] And we ought to think about wealth transfer.
[00:25:13] Because right now we are in the largest wealth transfer
[00:25:16] in American history, at least, is going on right now.
[00:25:20] And by the way, trustees is funny.
[00:25:24] It's funny.
[00:25:26] My sister and I, I'm the trustee of my parents, a state.
[00:25:29] And my, I, to be funny, I called her and I said,
[00:25:32] Ha, ha, I mean, a trustee and you're not.
[00:25:34] She goes, she goes, that's not it.
[00:25:36] You don't want to be the trustee.
[00:25:38] She's like a trustee.
[00:25:39] That worst job.
[00:25:40] So she started laughing at me.
[00:25:41] And then I called my dad.
[00:25:42] And I said, you made me trustee.
[00:25:44] And he goes, he started laughing.
[00:25:45] He goes, well, yeah, you have one of you had to be.
[00:25:48] But, but my sister and I, we get along.
[00:25:50] So we're going to be okay.
[00:25:51] But, and we have, you know, but we, we've talked about it.
[00:25:56] We've figured it out.
[00:25:57] We know what the plan is when, if and when, you know,
[00:26:01] my parents passed.
[00:26:02] Well, most, most people, they have a trust and have a trustee.
[00:26:05] Right? So there's three parties.
[00:26:06] There's a grantor, the owner of the property.
[00:26:08] There's a trustee that fulfills the instructions of the trust.
[00:26:11] Then there's a beneficiary.
[00:26:12] So the trustee acts on the best interests of the beneficiary.
[00:26:16] Yeah.
[00:26:16] But there's 21 things you need to know.
[00:26:18] Yeah.
[00:26:18] You need to be a trustee.
[00:26:19] And here's the funny thing about that.
[00:26:21] The world does not teach you that.
[00:26:23] Right.
[00:26:23] There's no attorney that'll teach you that.
[00:26:24] There's no class you can go to other than mine.
[00:26:27] There is no way to figure that out.
[00:26:29] And so I lay it all out for people.
[00:26:31] I'm saying these are the things that you're going to want to make sure you do.
[00:26:34] Because if you miss one of those,
[00:26:36] that could be problematic for you and your family.
[00:26:39] I love this, Dan.
[00:26:40] You have really taken a educational approach to your clients.
[00:26:45] It's not about, you are not transactional in any capacity.
[00:26:49] You are strictly about planning.
[00:26:51] And this is what successful financial advisors
[00:26:54] have done for years and years is to say,
[00:26:57] hey, maybe we don't manage all of the assets here at our company.
[00:27:02] But maybe you're 401Ks at your company.
[00:27:04] But I need to know what's going on there.
[00:27:06] So I can, you know, and you are doing a version of that here with real estate.
[00:27:12] And I think that is a really brilliant idea.
[00:27:17] Let's, well, first we should mention too,
[00:27:19] that Dan's team, they are always on the lookout for new talent or talent in the area.
[00:27:26] So if you are in Oahu and you are a listener of our show and you think you can add value
[00:27:32] to Dan's team and you think that's the kind of team I want to be on.
[00:27:35] You can certainly reach out to them.
[00:27:36] They will see if there's some synergy there.
[00:27:39] And Dan, for all of our listeners who haven't really dealt with senior living or senior,
[00:27:47] you know, challenges, senior home challenges,
[00:27:50] what do you recommend as a place to get started to start educating themselves?
[00:27:58] Join our community, join a class that understand.
[00:28:02] I think the first thing you have to understand is your client, right?
[00:28:06] Like we say in Hawaii, you know, walking the other person's slippers
[00:28:09] to feel what it feels like to be them, right?
[00:28:13] And so I'm going to Dallas and then San Antonio this week I leave today.
[00:28:19] And I'm teaching a class called aging and assets.
[00:28:23] And in the aging part of it, we have an immersion class of feeling how it feels to be an older adult.
[00:28:29] There are a number of things that will happen is when you go in an older adult's home and you're
[00:28:34] going to be sweating in there and they have all the windows closed. Why?
[00:28:37] Because they're dermar, their skin gets thin.
[00:28:39] So they get cold fast.
[00:28:40] They can't hear, they can't see, balance is a challenge.
[00:28:46] Cognitively they're going to slow down.
[00:28:47] Many of them don't have cell phones.
[00:28:49] Some of them don't even have any, I mean, so you just have to understand
[00:28:52] here you're dealing with, right?
[00:28:54] Once you understand that, then you can walk alongside them.
[00:28:57] Because if you don't understand them, then you're going to beat your head up like,
[00:29:01] what's wrong with this person?
[00:29:02] They're not like me.
[00:29:03] Well, of course they're not.
[00:29:05] They're much older, you think?
[00:29:06] They're twice your age, right?
[00:29:08] And so first is understanding who they are.
[00:29:12] The second thing is understanding their challenges.
[00:29:16] Challenges with their primary residence and challenges with investment properties.
[00:29:21] And then third is just bringing solutions to those problems.
[00:29:24] And when you do that, they will hire you.
[00:29:27] I love that.
[00:29:29] Dan, tell us more about your, some of the classes that you teach.
[00:29:38] Yeah.
[00:29:39] So I just taught the class Saturday.
[00:29:45] I was at an aging and place workshop.
[00:29:48] So it was a senior fair, so to speak.
[00:29:51] In my market, it was in a hotel.
[00:29:53] And I had two seminars.
[00:29:55] It was called,
[00:29:59] avoiding capital gains taxes and transferring real estate well.
[00:30:03] So usually in the morning, it's pretty busy in the afternoon.
[00:30:06] They go home, right?
[00:30:07] Well, I had one at 830 and one at 1230.
[00:30:10] At 830, it was a full room.
[00:30:12] I was like, dang, this is pretty busy.
[00:30:15] And keep in mind, I've done this for 14 years.
[00:30:18] And I used to do 1031 exchange seminars.
[00:30:22] Well, that sounds a little scary
[00:30:23] and some people don't know what it is.
[00:30:25] So I learned that I had to dump everything down to the simplest form,
[00:30:28] which is just avoiding capital gains taxes.
[00:30:31] Everybody wants to do that.
[00:30:33] They also want to transfer well.
[00:30:35] So I show up and there's a full room of 70 people.
[00:30:39] I did both of those seminars.
[00:30:41] We ended up with 20 appointments with people with a lot of wealth.
[00:30:46] I don't have enough real estate agents, DJ,
[00:30:48] to handle all this business.
[00:30:51] And it's a challenge for us.
[00:30:52] So we are aggressive.
[00:30:53] You're recruiting.
[00:30:55] That's part of it.
[00:30:56] The other part of what we do is we don't, we don't call, we don't doork,
[00:31:01] I don't pay for leads.
[00:31:03] We don't do any of that.
[00:31:04] We have a database of, you know, 1600 closed transactions, right?
[00:31:09] So all we do is talk to them.
[00:31:11] And what we do in the conversation today is this year we started it is,
[00:31:16] hey, DJ, we haven't talked to no one, but hey, did you know it's time for your final
[00:31:19] real estate plan to review it?
[00:31:22] They go, well, what's that?
[00:31:24] So it's a plan to help you build wealth, protect wealth,
[00:31:27] and then possibly pass on wealth.
[00:31:30] What's one of those things matter most to you?
[00:31:33] Brilliant.
[00:31:35] See, because it's, I know it one of those things matter.
[00:31:39] And then so we just, it's just so easy to get appointments with people with wealth,
[00:31:44] people that already know you and trust you.
[00:31:46] And now what happens is we talk to the, see that the client,
[00:31:50] mother and father, right?
[00:31:53] Well, they have parents, both sides.
[00:31:56] So we're going to ask about their parents.
[00:31:58] They're going to ask about their siblings.
[00:31:59] We're going to ask about their kids.
[00:32:01] Then we're going to talk about their grandkids.
[00:32:03] And so now we have this holistic, huge, I call it, what's the opportunity within the opportunity?
[00:32:10] Right?
[00:32:10] Most people see the couple as a transaction.
[00:32:14] Well, they're missing the mark.
[00:32:15] They're missing the reality of the fact is that person knows other people with real estate.
[00:32:20] And those people have problems.
[00:32:22] And if you are able to solve beyond just, I want to buy this home,
[00:32:27] if you're able to, to package that within the framework of someone's overall financial plan,
[00:32:36] that is a different, a very different transaction with the same end result buying a home.
[00:32:42] And it's, it's, it's, it's, you're, you're kind of blowing my mind in a way.
[00:32:48] You know, I don't have concerns or challenges with listing price.
[00:32:54] I don't have concerns or challenges or commissions.
[00:32:57] I just don't because it's, I'm worth more than what I'm giving them.
[00:33:03] Right? And what they're paying, I mean, they, they don't even question me on, on what I do.
[00:33:07] And I, and I, my margins are higher than anything else in my market.
[00:33:12] All negotiations, all commissions and negotiations.
[00:33:14] Sure.
[00:33:15] My point is they're going to pay for what they believe is worth it.
[00:33:19] And when, when I show them that I save them hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars
[00:33:24] in plans, I save them from their family fighting, they, they hire me.
[00:33:29] Yeah, it's, it's always about value.
[00:33:31] If, if you can create value, commit, you know, when, when NAR had the, you know, commission
[00:33:37] conversion and we all had to now start asking buyers for commissions,
[00:33:42] um, the really best REALTORS out there said, this is not a problem.
[00:33:47] This is not, I provide so much value that I, in many REALTORS, had been doing this anyway,
[00:33:54] prior to the NAR lawsuit, but, or the, the, the change.
[00:33:58] And I want to, but let's talk about 1031 exchanges.
[00:34:02] I just think there are a lot of our listeners who probably don't know about 1031.
[00:34:07] So what is 1031 and why should agents care about it?
[00:34:11] So I'll walk you through a conversation, the simplest conversation,
[00:34:16] and for takeaway for today, for the agencies, ask one simple question,
[00:34:20] do you own more than one property?
[00:34:22] See, if the answer is yes, they're an investor.
[00:34:25] Because they live in one, the IRS sees properties as you live in one, as a primary
[00:34:30] residence and the rest, you don't live in.
[00:34:32] Because you can only live in one, right?
[00:34:34] And so if you have more than one, you're an investor.
[00:34:37] Next question would be, how's that working for you?
[00:34:41] And what your goal is to find the problem.
[00:34:43] At some point, over the age of 60, 70, and 80, there will be problems.
[00:34:49] Tenant didn't pay, I'm tired of the toilet,
[00:34:52] and Tenant's the taxes, the trash.
[00:34:54] Oh, here's another thing that's happening is insurance rates are rising.
[00:34:59] So what happens when costs rise, but your income doesn't, your rate of return goes down.
[00:35:06] So then I ask them, oh, so what's your cap rate?
[00:35:10] And they go, what's a cap rate?
[00:35:12] I think in my next large, no, no.
[00:35:16] It's a capitalization rate.
[00:35:18] Would you like to know?
[00:35:19] Would you like a free asset performance test?
[00:35:22] And everybody says yes, and they don't even know what it is.
[00:35:26] Because I made it up.
[00:35:28] Not today, I made it up years ago, but an asset performance test is a cap rate analysis
[00:35:33] in a cash on cash.
[00:35:35] And then my next question to them is if you could make more money, would you?
[00:35:39] Well, I already know the answer is going to be yes.
[00:35:41] So when I do an asset performance test with people,
[00:35:45] I show them their capital gains tax, how much money they save
[00:35:47] if they do a 1031 exchange.
[00:35:50] And then I show them their rate of return, and they're getting zero to 2% in my market.
[00:35:55] I say, well, how do you feel about that?
[00:35:58] They go, that's not good.
[00:35:59] Yeah, inflation is historically at 3%.
[00:36:02] Yeah, yeah.
[00:36:03] So if you're not over 3%, you're kind of floating backwards.
[00:36:07] So if I can get you 5%, would you be interested?
[00:36:12] 
[00:36:12] Yes.
[00:36:13] Now you have a client that's going to sell and buy.
[00:36:16] Within a time frame, a couple of things happen is they're going to be highly motivated
[00:36:20] because they have to buy number one and they're buying in cash.
[00:36:24] Why?
[00:36:25] Because they paid off their debt.
[00:36:27] So you're not talking to a 20 and 30 year old, we're talking to a 60, 70 and 80 year old or a 9 year old
[00:36:32] that doesn't want it anymore.
[00:36:36] So one of my earlier questions to them is, do you need the income from this investment property
[00:36:41] to sustain the life you desire?
[00:36:44] That doesn't sound like a real truth.
[00:36:46] That's a financial question.
[00:36:47] But I asked, I have nothing to do with me.
[00:36:51] So if they say yes, I'm going to go make more money.
[00:36:54] If they say no, my next question is, if you could bless your family, would you?
[00:36:59] Why already know the answer is yes.
[00:37:01] And so then I talk about their family.
[00:37:03] And I asked them do their kids have real estate?
[00:37:05] You know, I said, well, if they don't own real estate, if they could, would they?
[00:37:10] That's another magic question.
[00:37:11] The answer is yes.
[00:37:11] I've got about 20 magic questions that I ask.
[00:37:15] Because so not every question is the same.
[00:37:18] And so there's a system and a pattern to this.
[00:37:20] What I figured out, DJ, is there's only seven types of human beings
[00:37:24] that will to what meet.
[00:37:26] And there's only seven questions to get an appointment and then getting an agreement.
[00:37:31] So what I teach is that in the world of real estate, there's only two things you really need to do.
[00:37:36] You need to get an appointment.
[00:37:37] You need to get an agreement.
[00:37:39] And the reason why REALTORS are not successful is they don't have enough appointments.
[00:37:45] Right?
[00:37:45] Because if you don't have an appointment, you don't have an agreement.
[00:37:47] You have double your appointments.
[00:37:48] You have double your business.
[00:37:49] Yeah.
[00:37:51] Absolutely.
[00:37:52] So I have one to three appointments every day.
[00:37:55] Well, I'm home.
[00:37:56] That's why I have a pipeline, a business that's just outrageous.
[00:38:00] And I don't have an effasions.
[00:38:02] So the question around them and their money matters.
[00:38:07] And I can guide them through either a path of making money or blessing their family.
[00:38:12] It's one of two.
[00:38:13] So I already know there's only two paths to go.
[00:38:16] Right?
[00:38:17] The other path could be, I want money, but I don't need it.
[00:38:20] Right?
[00:38:21] I don't want the property.
[00:38:22] Then there's passive income.
[00:38:25] So for the investor, I ask them a simple question.
[00:38:28] Would you like to be an active investor or a passive investor?
[00:38:32] It's a simple question.
[00:38:34] But people in baby boomer and their parents, none of them want active.
[00:38:38] They don't want the 2am phone calls.
[00:38:40] They don't want it.
[00:38:42] They don't need it.
[00:38:43] They got more money than they can spend.
[00:38:45] That's the target audience.
[00:38:47] The person that cannot spend all of their money,
[00:38:49] they already know that.
[00:38:51] They have a money problem, which means it's too much.
[00:38:54] That's been my focus.
[00:38:58] So then, if there are passive income,
[00:39:02] then there's one route that we go.
[00:39:04] And it's called a DST, a Delaware statutory trust.
[00:39:07] I can sell an investment property via a 1031 exchange by a DST or an invest in a DST.
[00:39:14] And it gives them true passive income.
[00:39:17] What is a DST?
[00:39:19] It's a trusted owns real estate.
[00:39:23] The Amazon warehouse in North Carolina is a DST.
[00:39:27] The ESPN new center is a DST.
[00:39:30] There's who tells an Austin, Texas that are DSTs.
[00:39:33] I own one in three states, apartment buildings.
[00:39:37] So I sold an asset that was getting 2.1% return and I get 5.5% return.
[00:39:43] And I don't even think about it.
[00:39:45] It's truly passive.
[00:39:47] It's similar to an annuity.
[00:39:49] So what I do is I use that tool to help them unlock wealth.
[00:39:54] And I reposition it.
[00:39:55] So that's our conversation.
[00:39:57] If they have wealth in real estate,
[00:39:59] if you could unlock it and reposition it to whatever mattered most to you, would you?
[00:40:04] 
[00:40:05] And so then my conversations are about living a big life.
[00:40:09] And my question to them is, see, these people,
[00:40:11] when some of them came from the depression or parts of that depression,
[00:40:15] where they held on to everything.
[00:40:17] And they didn't know that they had options with a 1031 exchange.
[00:40:22] So now I'm teaching them to identify value
[00:40:26] and see real estate differently from a house with doors and windows and a roof to an asset.
[00:40:32] It's an asset class that when you unlock it, how do you unlock it?
[00:40:37] We sell it.
[00:40:38] When you unlock it, you can reposition it meaning buy something else that matters more to you.
[00:40:44] Whether it be your family or making more money or just being passive.
[00:40:51] And that's the solution we provide to the world.
[00:40:54] And that's what we're teaching around the country.
[00:40:56] The 1031 exchange is an unknown to most people like cost basis is, right?
[00:41:04] Because it seems scary.
[00:41:06] It's actually not.
[00:41:08] It's not.
[00:41:09] I've done over 400 of them.
[00:41:11] I've never failed once.
[00:41:12] 100% success.
[00:41:14] Why could have a system to it?
[00:41:17] And if you just follow a proven model, it's going to work.
[00:41:22] We do every month, we'll probably do four to six 1031 exchanges every month, right?
[00:41:29] On the buy and the sell side.
[00:41:31] And that's what's really cool.
[00:41:33] You have one client, you got two transactions, twice the income.
[00:41:37] And by the way, I don't know if you know this, but 34% of all households in America
[00:41:44] are rentals.
[00:41:45] Wow.
[00:41:46] So one in every three homes, you drive by is a rental.
[00:41:49] And here's another statistic you want to know is,
[00:41:52] the average landlord, they have three of them.
[00:41:56] So if you're looking for the guy with the most amount of real estate,
[00:41:59] why would you look anywhere else?
[00:42:01] There is no other demographic that holds the wealth of real estate that wants to get rid of it.
[00:42:08] And is at a point now that they're worried about tax and their family.
[00:42:13] And that's why this solution has become so popular.
[00:42:16] It's a movement that I'm bringing to the world and our team has to maybe change the way
[00:42:23] the conversation shows up for a REALTOR, right?
[00:42:27] And ask questions around wealth to help them plan their wealth,
[00:42:31] the building protecting and the passing on.
[00:42:34] This transfer wealth that you spoke of, $90 trillion, we transferred, and $40 trillion of that
[00:42:41] is in real estate, $40 trillion.
[00:42:44] It's incredible.
[00:42:46] And now the next generation, the baby boomers and the gen X's,
[00:42:51] are kind of concerned about their money.
[00:42:53] What's going to happen when mom and dad die?
[00:42:55] They're planning, but there's really not many places to look for it.
[00:43:01] And so this movement about creating real estate wealth advisors is a massive movement
[00:43:06] which will be open to everybody anywhere.
[00:43:11] You are basically the leader of the Keller Williams real estate planner movement.
[00:43:17] You have built that class and course and continue to teach it to agents all over the country.
[00:43:24] Dan, if someone wanted to start learning more from you, where should they go?
[00:43:34] Probably you two.
[00:43:35] I mean, you could probably find me everywhere.
[00:43:38] I've done over 200 hours of training over the last three years.
[00:43:44] Join our community.
[00:43:45] I have another class that's agnostic.
[00:43:47] They can come into, call it, securing listings with the wealthy.
[00:43:51] I do that three to four times a year.
[00:43:54] Soon to be the continued education class.
[00:43:58] So what we're also doing, DJ, that, you know, that continuing education class that I'm offering
[00:44:03] to REALTORS, I'm also offering it to financial planners.
[00:44:07] It'll be a C class for financial planner.
[00:44:10] And I'm also offering it for consumers.
[00:44:13] Consumers can learn what you should be learning.
[00:44:16] And then they're going to go seek out a real estate wealth advisor.
[00:44:20] And those people are going to win.
[00:44:23] I love it.
[00:44:24] Donahara is our guest today.
[00:44:26] He is the leader of the Keller Williams real estate planner
[00:44:30] and the AHara team in Oahu.
[00:44:33] He is, by the way, Dan has clients that move from the island to the mainland and back and forth.
[00:44:43] So if you are a real turn area that feeds into Oahu or the surrounding islands
[00:44:48] and or vice versa, Dan would like to partner with you.
[00:44:52] So if you have opportunities there where you have clients that have vacation homes or maybe
[00:44:57] retiring out to Hawaii or moving in and out for whatever reason, definitely reach out to him
[00:45:03] and his team. They're the number one Keller Williams team on Oahu.
[00:45:07] And also reach out to him.
[00:45:10] If you are an agent on Oahu and you are looking to maybe get a better
[00:45:15] to see what else what else is out there with other teams.
[00:45:17] And what Dan offers is truly remarkable.
[00:45:20] Dan, I have talked to hundreds of REALTORS all over the country
[00:45:24] who offer all sorts of services.
[00:45:26] This is the most unique service set that I have ever experienced in my seven years.
[00:45:32] So I applaud you for what you're doing.
[00:45:35] Thank you.
[00:45:36] I really am so impressed with the holistic approach that you take to wealth transfer
[00:45:43] and seeing this as a consultative business versus a transactional business.
[00:45:49] And everyone says that.
[00:45:50] But you're actually doing it.
[00:45:52] Everyone says I don't see my clients as transactions and yet they are doing transactions.
[00:45:57] And I suspect you know it's not because agents are nefarious.
[00:46:03] They just don't know how to do more.
[00:46:06] And what you are doing is actually the next step.
[00:46:10] So I am so impressed with what you've built, what you continue to build,
[00:46:14] what your team has done, and what the businesses you've built have created.
[00:46:18] And the education that you've put out there so that others can learn.
[00:46:22] This is a truly, you truly an amazing REALTOR and wealth planner.
[00:46:30] And what an amazing thing to have you on our show.
[00:46:34] So on behalf of our audience, we thank Dan for his time today.
[00:46:37] Dan, by the way, Dan has to get in the water.
[00:46:39] He surfs every day.
[00:46:40] And oh, Andy has one to three client appointments every day.
[00:46:44] By the way, I always love when you go back to that one thing.
[00:46:48] Speaking of Keller Williams, the one thing.
[00:46:49] The one thing that you know you have to do every day.
[00:46:54] And he's like, I have to have one to three appointments.
[00:46:56] And that's why my pipeline is always full.
[00:46:59] You said that earlier.
[00:47:00] It's just like doing push-ups.
[00:47:02] I have to do push-ups every day or whatever that is for you.
[00:47:05] Because it is the boulder we push up the mountain every single day.
[00:47:10] Dan's for him.
[00:47:11] It's surfing and it's appointments.
[00:47:14] And he is doing it.
[00:47:15] So on behalf of the audience, we say thanks to Dan.
[00:47:17] On behalf of Dan and myself, we thank the audience for sticking around
[00:47:21] to the end of the show.
[00:47:21] Please support our sponsors.
[00:47:23] Please check out Dan and his team.
[00:47:27] TheHARTeam.com is, I believe, the website.
[00:47:32] Oh, no, our team.com.
[00:47:33] We will have links to all their socials, including YouTube.
[00:47:36] In the show notes, our team.com is where you go to learn
[00:47:39] all about Dan and what he and his team are offering.

[00:47:48] Thank you so much.
[00:47:49] Aloha.

He is a superstar top 1% REALTOR in Oahu. Dan, welcome to the show. Thank you and Aloha. Aloha and I think I may have so called you Don earlier, so I apologize if I did that. But Dan, you are Dan. Dan, tell me the best piece of advice you ever heard in real estate. Gosh, there are so many pieces of advice that I got. I think one of the main principles of who we are and what we do today is the world of real estate, we're told to have a script to tell people. And then I learned that maybe it should be a flip on its head where we should be asking them questions. So I became a questionologist, DJ. I don't know if you know that, but people like me work questionologists. We study and use questions in our practice. I love that. More of a listener and a more of a consultant, right? A consultant's approach is more question focused and letting the client tell you everything that they are looking for versus you telling them, how you are so amazing. And you are so amazing. And but we want to hear your story first. So before we get into your process, let's tell your story. You are from Oahu, originally? I live in, I was born and raised on Oahu. My father was a Colonel in the Army, so I left when I was five and I came back when I was 15. We traveled around the country as an electric brat. And I saw 40 of the 50 states by the time I was 14. I came back to Hawaii. I went to University of Hawaii here and decided to stay because I saw the rest of the country and I realized this is the most beautiful place in the planet. So I- No argument there. Yeah, I got in the surfing at 15 years old and I never turned back. 62 now, I've been surfing for a really long time. Amazing. Yeah. And Oahu had the longboard surfing. That was sort of what became really popular or maybe that was out in Maui. I'm not sure. But that was Hawaii had longboard surfing, which I know was very, was not what was happening over on the California coast. Yeah, well, actually it was born in Hawaii surfing and it was brought to the California coast. But yeah, I've been surfing for a long time. I ride a shortboard and a longboard. I have only two goals in life, DJ. It's one is to watch every sunrise and sunset until I die and the second is to surf every day until I can't. And I ask my wife, I have a board meeting every day. I love that. And you've still managed to find the time to close a lot of real estate sales. And you are a listing agent predominantly. Your team you guys focused about 70% of your business is on listings 30% on buy side. Let's talk about how you got started. How did you get into the business? Sure. Well, I used to sell waterproof cameras around the world. So I took the belt of the globe and I prospected that world, which was quite a big larger world. So I traveled a lot. And my wife, we had three kids at the time and she said maybe you ought to stay home so they know your name. I decided I needed to find a job to stay home. And I met a guy that was in real estate and he introduced me to it. And I took a class at the University of Hawaii and I did well and I really enjoyed it. I thought, home, maybe I could do this. It was either this or pharmaceuticals. So something real estate, some drugs. I picked those days. Well, at least it would keep you home. Like selling pharmaceuticals, you may have had to travel the states again. And because the pharmaceutical companies are not located in Hawaii, I'm assuming. So yeah. So you started doing that and how did you begin to develop your business? What did you do that you maybe I'm sure you've seen lots of agents come and go? What were you doing differently? So for me, it's always been mindset. I've been a serial entrepreneur on my life since I was an out of college. I built businesses. And when I got into real estate, I had one mantra was, I want to be the best REALTOR on the planet. Just this planet. No other planet. Right? And so I asked myself, well, how do I become the best REALTOR on the planet? And I said, well, I needed to learn contract. So I studied the contract back in front. And I mastered it. I knew every provision. And I knew different perspectives of it. I learned properties. I went to every broker's open. I met prop. I learned neighborhoods. I didn't even know. Then I met agents. I got to good. I got them to like me. And then I realized that, well, I needed to find the right client. So who has the most real estate? And I was sitting on the beach with my brother who was doing reverse mortgages at the time. And he said, Dan, there's this huge wave of this silver tsunami that's coming. And this is, remember, 20 years ago. And these people are going to have a lot of problems. They're going to have to leave their home. And they need, they need some help. But there's no REALTOR. They're wealth transfers. What you're talking about. Right. Right. The big wealth transfer. Well, 20 years ago, nobody really talked about that. My brother was already on it. My brother Percy. And so I really owe it to him because he really encouraged me to focus on this market where they had wealth and the head wealth and real estate. Then he said to me, then you should educate people on the value of using it. And so I'm six months into being a REALTOR. I committed to the newspaper for you, young folks. It's this big piece of paper that we would open up and look at. That's what it is on it. And stories. Yeah. Yeah, words and pictures and things. Yeah. And people actually paid that haven't nailed to you. Well, back in those days, by the way, we still do the newspaper. The circulation was large and older adults looked at it. And so then I started teaching classes on month six of being a licensed REALTOR. You had no business teaching classes at month six. What did I love it? Yeah. And educating them on best practice. How to buy a home in today's market. How to sell a home today's market. That was as simple as it is. So you were an educator. I've always been an educator. My father traveled around the country and taught us. But you want to learn and grow. And how do you learn and grow? Well, by asking a lot of questions. So over time, I became this questionologist. Right. I want to pause you just for a quick second because what you're saying is actually quite profound where we're talking about a newer agent six months in. Certainly doesn't have the knowledge, the skill set, the experience. But what he can do or what you did is you created a program to teach. And you started teaching it. What that instantly does is it almost eliminates the issue of your young and don't know what you're doing. And nobody's going to ask you at this point. Oh, you've only been in the six months because you're teaching a class. And by doing that, it bypasses the whole. I wonder how long this guy's been in the business because you are now seen as an authority figure. And a knowledge was I've never really thought of it before like that. And I thought, and I just, what you were telling me that my marketing brain went while that was really, really smart. Because now people will see you as this important person who certainly must know what he's doing. Yeah. And then I started finding out that there was this huge wave of people that needed to leave their home. But they didn't know where to go. So I started a class called senior living options. Where do I go if I can't stay home? How much does it cost? What does life look like? Who can help me? How do I get to? So I solved all of their questions that they had because I researched it all. And that's what we have in our community, KW Real Estate Planner. I teach three months of senior relocation of how do you find this demographic? How do you serve it? What are the problems that you can solve? If you think about everything that I've done, DJs, I've identified a problem. And then I provided a solution to their problem. And when I provided the solution, they hired me with that solution. Dan, was anyone else as a REALTOR focused on senior reloc? I can't imagine. I've done this podcast for seven years, 700 episodes. You are the very first person I have ever talked to. Who's the one who's the last question? Yeah, no, back in those days, nobody did. And even till today, there are a couple of companies that are trying to follow suit. And they don't have their level of success. We really mastered it. We, one of the things that we learned is, we don't know where to go. So I researched it and I got to know everybody. In our market, there was only seven retirement communities. There's two types of retirement community models. And so I can tell them how much it costs, where to go, what does life look like? How do I get there? I solved those problems for them. But then I found out their biggest problem is not only where to go, it's, what do I do with all my stuff? Yeah. So they were trapped in their home by the personal belongings they brought into their own home and then made them stuck in their home. Yeah. So then I looked around for companies that would help them clear it out. And there weren't any. So I started my own. It's called Senior Move Managers and Decletter Hawaii. Where I hired my niece, she would come in and she would, with our team of people, help them cleanse the home. Make them feel comfortable with moving. Take all their things, put it into their new home, set it up. And then we'd go back and clear out the house and sell it. And that was the magic sauce. So there was a retirement community that came new into our market. They had 180 units in this building. The, it was a CCRC. You know what a CCRC is? No. Continuing care retirement community. This is a life care guarantee system where they pay anywhere from 400 to 800,000 dollars just to get the key. Then they pay another six to 8,000 dollars a month for the care and service for the rest of their life. Guess what? That's where the wealthy go. Sure. So I found out what happens when people with money can't stay home. And I, I brought that solution to the market. And I've been doing these seminars for gosh, I was 20 years now. Senior, senior living options was the name of the title. And then I changed it because one of my competitors took my exact same title. I can't believe that, right? Really pissed me off. But it was okay. Then I changed it to planning for the future and beyond. Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery they say, right? Or we just call it theft. But either way, either way, Dan, what you're talking about is really, really brilliant for obvious reasons. Everyone listening, you know, is probably their draws. Hopefully is open is mine. Because what we're talking about is a need that every family has at a point. You know, the elder members of the family now have to figure out where they're going to sunset and where they're going to spend the rest of their lives. And this is a big family decision. There isn't a lot of guidance around this. I know families now they come together. They figure out what are we going to do with mom and dad? Where are they going to go? What communities are available to them? And what's the cost? Is there a long-term care insurance? All of those things. So I suspect that you probably partner with other providers as well. I'm assuming a state planners, financial planners, things like that. Yeah. So then my next question to myself was, who do the wealthy go to if they have a question regarding their home? Well, that was exactly it. They're going to, first thing they're going to do is they're going to go to their financial planner to see if they have enough money. Second is they're going to go to their CPA to see if there's any tax associated to the sale. And what we should talk about capital gains set because that's a big part of our business. And then the third is they're going to go maybe potentially talk to their attorney as well to see if there's any challenge with what's in the trust and what they're planning on doing. And so those are the people that I started calling. I didn't call clients. I called people that had people. So I went to go get the bird dogs. I wanted to talk to somebody that could get me 10 properties, not just one. And it worked. To a point where I now just did, I think it was in January, a continuing education class for the financial planners association of Hawaii. And now I'm asked to speak around the country to the financial planners associations of America. Because people have wealth in many areas, stock, bonds, Bitcoin, all the liquid assets. Then they have wealth in real estate. So the question is who plans real estate? Nobody does. Yeah, you're right. Hence we started the community called KW real estate planner, where we actually create design and pre-inheritance plans, ways to keep money in your pocket, prevent family disputes. Because DJ 70% of families are fighting over real estate after their parents pass away. 70%. And the biggest reason for that is you can't divide real estate. You see, what happens is if you've got wealth, you're going to build a trust. And the trust says, upon my demise, my kids share it. How do you share real estate? You can't. Hence 70% of families are reacting to a situation where maybe one's living there, the other's aren't. And you really think it's really touchy with people. If someone have sentimental, hold sentimental value and don't want to sell, others want to sell, it's not money that you can just divvy up. Well, and it's a lot of money. I mean, we're not talking, you know, five or ten bucks. This is millions of dollars they're talking about. Real money that they never believe they could have a part of, but now it's real and it's on the table. And now the judge has gone. Mom and dad's gone. Now all the hurts and offences of the history and the past come to the service when they're trying to get what they believe is their fair share. And that's why plans need to be happened. And so I do pre-inheritance plans for families. Plans such as their families never fight. Plans to bless their family while they're alive. And also plans to prevent capital gains tax from touching their life. Let's talk about capital gains tax. That is a huge topic right now in, you know, in America. What's going on with capital gains and what are you doing to help your clients protect themselves? Well, number one, we're asking the question. So for those in the audience, my challenge to you is to understand what capital gains tax is. See, I travel all over the country and I ask the simple question. Tell me who knows cost basis. And people don't even know cost basis. Well, if they don't know cost basis, you don't know capital gains tax. Right. Because it starts with the basis, right? Yeah. And the basis is really the value that you purchase it at or the value of the date of transfer. Yeah. And that's the sticky part. Because if it was transferred prior to death, you have a carry over in cost basis. If it's transferred after death, you get a step up in cost basis. And people don't even understand that. Realters around the country don't really understand that. And so that's why I'm on an national platform to change the way REALTOR show up. And I'm challenging you to ask the simple question. When you go to a list in the appointment, do you understand what your capital gains tax liability is when you sell real estate? Because nobody asked that question. That's a great question. Nope. Nobody asked that question. Or you know why that is? I've realized why that is. Number one, industry doesn't teach us that. Number two, it doesn't impact our money. So why are you asking questions that doesn't impact you? Well, if you really care about the client, if you're going to be a true advocate and consultant or a real estate wealth advisor like I am, you're going to ask that question. And you're going to calculate it for him. And you're going to know what that looks like prior to even showing up. And really what you're doing too, this falls under the umbrella fiduciary, right? And so, although not expected to do, but certainly something that will provide not only value to the consumer, but also will establish you as their key partner throughout the entire the length, the time that they're in that home. So I love that idea. It almost cements you as the person as you start to, by the way, as you're moving in, let's talk about capital gains. Yeah, yeah. You know, clients call me the advisor now. They don't call me a REALTOR. Yeah. And that's a big difference. Huge. Because there's lots of REALTOR's out there. There's not a lot of advisors. No, no. And what's really cool about this is I get at least three levels of clients. Right? I got the parents, the children, and the grandparents. Why? Because we're creating plans sometimes for generation skipping trust. We're passing on real wealth, like significant wealth. And that's where our focus has been. Wow. So you really take a holistic approach to managing, you know, the real estate portion, but you have partners or businesses to assist with the other aspects of it, a state planning, financial planning, tax, all of that. Yeah. Yeah. I do three classes in my market. One is called senior living options. The other is avoiding capital gain tax and transferring real estate. Well, and the third is I'm a trustee now. What? And they're all designed to provide information to the wealthy that they need. See, think of it this way. Every wealthy person has a trust, right? To protect it from probing. Sure. But then the question is, is well, what happens when you're gone? And they said, I don't know, the trust takes care of it. So oh, I asked them so really? So tell me what it says. I said, well, I don't know what it says. I said, well, I can tell you what it says. Because I've seen thousands of these. And very few have a timeframe on it. What it says is upon your demise, your kids share it. So let me ask you, are all your kids alike? Do they think alike? Do they act alike? Are they in the same economic phase of life? So if the answer is no to any of those questions, you're likely going to be a statistic. Or do you have a plan such that when you're gone, your kids will love each other forever. That doesn't sound like a REALTOR does it. No. And some people ask me, oh, but I need to sell real estate. Can you help me too? Yeah, I can do that as well. Because they don't consider me like everybody else. Yeah, you're not a REALTOR. No, I'm much more than that. A real estate wealth advisor. Wow, well, Dan, that is, it's really quite a profound paradigm shift. I'm a bit aghast at this. And the professionalism that you, you, you, you, you emote is very impressive. And we ought to think about wealth transfer. Because right now we are in the largest wealth transfer in American history, at least, is going on right now. And by the way, trustees is funny. It's funny. My sister and I, I'm the trustee of my parents, a state. And my, I, to be funny, I called her and I said, Ha, ha, I mean, a trustee and you're not. She goes, she goes, that's not it. You don't want to be the trustee. She's like a trustee. That worst job. So she started laughing at me. And then I called my dad. And I said, you made me trustee. And he goes, he started laughing. He goes, well, yeah, you have one of you had to be. But, but my sister and I, we get along. So we're going to be okay. But, and we have, you know, but we, we've talked about it. We've figured it out. We know what the plan is when, if and when, you know, my parents passed. Well, most, most people, they have a trust and have a trustee. Right? So there's three parties. There's a grantor, the owner of the property. There's a trustee that fulfills the instructions of the trust. Then there's a beneficiary. So the trustee acts on the best interests of the beneficiary. Yeah. But there's 21 things you need to know. Yeah. You need to be a trustee. And here's the funny thing about that. The world does not teach you that. Right. There's no attorney that'll teach you that. There's no class you can go to other than mine. There is no way to figure that out. And so I lay it all out for people. I'm saying these are the things that you're going to want to make sure you do. Because if you miss one of those, that could be problematic for you and your family. I love this, Dan. You have really taken a educational approach to your clients. It's not about, you are not transactional in any capacity. You are strictly about planning. And this is what successful financial advisors have done for years and years is to say, hey, maybe we don't manage all of the assets here at our company. But maybe you're 401Ks at your company. But I need to know what's going on there. So I can, you know, and you are doing a version of that here with real estate. And I think that is a really brilliant idea. Let's, well, first we should mention too, that Dan's team, they are always on the lookout for new talent or talent in the area. So if you are in Oahu and you are a listener of our show and you think you can add value to Dan's team and you think that's the kind of team I want to be on. You can certainly reach out to them. They will see if there's some synergy there. And Dan, for all of our listeners who haven't really dealt with senior living or senior, you know, challenges, senior home challenges, what do you recommend as a place to get started to start educating themselves? Join our community, join a class that understand. I think the first thing you have to understand is your client, right? Like we say in Hawaii, you know, walking the other person's slippers to feel what it feels like to be them, right? And so I'm going to Dallas and then San Antonio this week I leave today. And I'm teaching a class called aging and assets. And in the aging part of it, we have an immersion class of feeling how it feels to be an older adult. There are a number of things that will happen is when you go in an older adult's home and you're going to be sweating in there and they have all the windows closed. Why? Because they're dermar, their skin gets thin. So they get cold fast. They can't hear, they can't see, balance is a challenge. Cognitively they're going to slow down. Many of them don't have cell phones. Some of them don't even have any, I mean, so you just have to understand here you're dealing with, right? Once you understand that, then you can walk alongside them. Because if you don't understand them, then you're going to beat your head up like, what's wrong with this person? They're not like me. Well, of course they're not. They're much older, you think? They're twice your age, right? And so first is understanding who they are. The second thing is understanding their challenges. Challenges with their primary residence and challenges with investment properties. And then third is just bringing solutions to those problems. And when you do that, they will hire you. I love that. Dan, tell us more about your, some of the classes that you teach. Yeah. So I just taught the class Saturday. I was at an aging and place workshop. So it was a senior fair, so to speak. In my market, it was in a hotel. And I had two seminars. It was called, avoiding capital gains taxes and transferring real estate well. So usually in the morning, it's pretty busy in the afternoon. They go home, right? Well, I had one at 830 and one at 1230. At 830, it was a full room. I was like, dang, this is pretty busy. And keep in mind, I've done this for 14 years. And I used to do 1031 exchange seminars. Well, that sounds a little scary and some people don't know what it is. So I learned that I had to dump everything down to the simplest form, which is just avoiding capital gains taxes. Everybody wants to do that. They also want to transfer well. So I show up and there's a full room of 70 people. I did both of those seminars. We ended up with 20 appointments with people with a lot of wealth. I don't have enough real estate agents, DJ, to handle all this business. And it's a challenge for us. So we are aggressive. You're recruiting. That's part of it. The other part of what we do is we don't, we don't call, we don't doork, I don't pay for leads. We don't do any of that. We have a database of, you know, 1600 closed transactions, right? So all we do is talk to them. And what we do in the conversation today is this year we started it is, hey, DJ, we haven't talked to no one, but hey, did you know it's time for your final real estate plan to review it? They go, well, what's that? So it's a plan to help you build wealth, protect wealth, and then possibly pass on wealth. What's one of those things matter most to you? Brilliant. See, because it's, I know it one of those things matter. And then so we just, it's just so easy to get appointments with people with wealth, people that already know you and trust you. And now what happens is we talk to the, see that the client, mother and father, right? Well, they have parents, both sides. So we're going to ask about their parents. They're going to ask about their siblings. We're going to ask about their kids. Then we're going to talk about their grandkids. And so now we have this holistic, huge, I call it, what's the opportunity within the opportunity? Right? Most people see the couple as a transaction. Well, they're missing the mark. They're missing the reality of the fact is that person knows other people with real estate. And those people have problems. And if you are able to solve beyond just, I want to buy this home, if you're able to, to package that within the framework of someone's overall financial plan, that is a different, a very different transaction with the same end result buying a home. And it's, it's, it's, it's, you're, you're kind of blowing my mind in a way. You know, I don't have concerns or challenges with listing price. I don't have concerns or challenges or commissions. I just don't because it's, I'm worth more than what I'm giving them. Right? And what they're paying, I mean, they, they don't even question me on, on what I do. And I, and I, my margins are higher than anything else in my market. All negotiations, all commissions and negotiations. Sure. My point is they're going to pay for what they believe is worth it. And when, when I show them that I save them hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars in plans, I save them from their family fighting, they, they hire me. Yeah, it's, it's always about value. If, if you can create value, commit, you know, when, when NAR had the, you know, commission conversion and we all had to now start asking buyers for commissions, um, the really best REALTORS out there said, this is not a problem. This is not, I provide so much value that I, in many REALTORS, had been doing this anyway, prior to the NAR lawsuit, but, or the, the, the change. And I want to, but let's talk about 1031 exchanges. I just think there are a lot of our listeners who probably don't know about 1031. So what is 1031 and why should agents care about it? So I'll walk you through a conversation, the simplest conversation, and for takeaway for today, for the agencies, ask one simple question, do you own more than one property? See, if the answer is yes, they're an investor. Because they live in one, the IRS sees properties as you live in one, as a primary residence and the rest, you don't live in. Because you can only live in one, right? And so if you have more than one, you're an investor. Next question would be, how's that working for you? And what your goal is to find the problem. At some point, over the age of 60, 70, and 80, there will be problems. Tenant didn't pay, I'm tired of the toilet, and Tenant's the taxes, the trash. Oh, here's another thing that's happening is insurance rates are rising. So what happens when costs rise, but your income doesn't, your rate of return goes down. So then I ask them, oh, so what's your cap rate? And they go, what's a cap rate? I think in my next large, no, no. It's a capitalization rate. Would you like to know? Would you like a free asset performance test? And everybody says yes, and they don't even know what it is. Because I made it up. Not today, I made it up years ago, but an asset performance test is a cap rate analysis in a cash on cash. And then my next question to them is if you could make more money, would you? Well, I already know the answer is going to be yes. So when I do an asset performance test with people, I show them their capital gains tax, how much money they save if they do a 1031 exchange. And then I show them their rate of return, and they're getting zero to 2% in my market. I say, well, how do you feel about that? They go, that's not good. Yeah, inflation is historically at 3%. Yeah, yeah. So if you're not over 3%, you're kind of floating backwards. So if I can get you 5%, would you be interested? Yes. Now you have a client that's going to sell and buy. Within a time frame, a couple of things happen is they're going to be highly motivated because they have to buy number one and they're buying in cash. Why? Because they paid off their debt. So you're not talking to a 20 and 30 year old, we're talking to a 60, 70 and 80 year old or a 9 year old that doesn't want it anymore. So one of my earlier questions to them is, do you need the income from this investment property to sustain the life you desire? That doesn't sound like a real truth. That's a financial question. But I asked, I have nothing to do with me. So if they say yes, I'm going to go make more money. If they say no, my next question is, if you could bless your family, would you? Why already know the answer is yes. And so then I talk about their family. And I asked them do their kids have real estate? You know, I said, well, if they don't own real estate, if they could, would they? That's another magic question. The answer is yes. I've got about 20 magic questions that I ask. Because so not every question is the same. And so there's a system and a pattern to this. What I figured out, DJ, is there's only seven types of human beings that will to what meet. And there's only seven questions to get an appointment and then getting an agreement. So what I teach is that in the world of real estate, there's only two things you really need to do. You need to get an appointment. You need to get an agreement. And the reason why REALTORS are not successful is they don't have enough appointments. Right? Because if you don't have an appointment, you don't have an agreement. You have double your appointments. You have double your business. Yeah. Absolutely. So I have one to three appointments every day. Well, I'm home. That's why I have a pipeline, a business that's just outrageous. And I don't have an effasions. So the question around them and their money matters. And I can guide them through either a path of making money or blessing their family. It's one of two. So I already know there's only two paths to go. Right? The other path could be, I want money, but I don't need it. Right? I don't want the property. Then there's passive income. So for the investor, I ask them a simple question. Would you like to be an active investor or a passive investor? It's a simple question. But people in baby boomer and their parents, none of them want active. They don't want the 2am phone calls. They don't want it. They don't need it. They got more money than they can spend. That's the target audience. The person that cannot spend all of their money, they already know that. They have a money problem, which means it's too much. That's been my focus. So then, if there are passive income, then there's one route that we go. And it's called a DST, a Delaware statutory trust. I can sell an investment property via a 1031 exchange by a DST or an invest in a DST. And it gives them true passive income. What is a DST? It's a trusted owns real estate. The Amazon warehouse in North Carolina is a DST. The ESPN new center is a DST. There's who tells an Austin, Texas that are DSTs. I own one in three states, apartment buildings. So I sold an asset that was getting 2.1% return and I get 5.5% return. And I don't even think about it. It's truly passive. It's similar to an annuity. So what I do is I use that tool to help them unlock wealth. And I reposition it. So that's our conversation. If they have wealth in real estate, if you could unlock it and reposition it to whatever mattered most to you, would you? And so then my conversations are about living a big life. And my question to them is, see, these people, when some of them came from the depression or parts of that depression, where they held on to everything. And they didn't know that they had options with a 1031 exchange. So now I'm teaching them to identify value and see real estate differently from a house with doors and windows and a roof to an asset. It's an asset class that when you unlock it, how do you unlock it? We sell it. When you unlock it, you can reposition it meaning buy something else that matters more to you. Whether it be your family or making more money or just being passive. And that's the solution we provide to the world. And that's what we're teaching around the country. The 1031 exchange is an unknown to most people like cost basis is, right? Because it seems scary. It's actually not. It's not. I've done over 400 of them. I've never failed once. 100% success. Why could have a system to it? And if you just follow a proven model, it's going to work. We do every month, we'll probably do four to six 1031 exchanges every month, right? On the buy and the sell side. And that's what's really cool. You have one client, you got two transactions, twice the income. And by the way, I don't know if you know this, but 34% of all households in America are rentals. Wow. So one in every three homes, you drive by is a rental. And here's another statistic you want to know is, the average landlord, they have three of them. So if you're looking for the guy with the most amount of real estate, why would you look anywhere else? There is no other demographic that holds the wealth of real estate that wants to get rid of it. And is at a point now that they're worried about tax and their family. And that's why this solution has become so popular. It's a movement that I'm bringing to the world and our team has to maybe change the way the conversation shows up for a REALTOR, right? And ask questions around wealth to help them plan their wealth, the building protecting and the passing on. This transfer wealth that you spoke of, $90 trillion, we transferred, and $40 trillion of that is in real estate, $40 trillion. It's incredible. And now the next generation, the baby boomers and the gen X's, are kind of concerned about their money. What's going to happen when mom and dad die? They're planning, but there's really not many places to look for it. And so this movement about creating real estate wealth advisors is a massive movement which will be open to everybody anywhere. You are basically the leader of the Keller Williams real estate planner movement. You have built that class and course and continue to teach it to agents all over the country. Dan, if someone wanted to start learning more from you, where should they go? Probably you two. I mean, you could probably find me everywhere. I've done over 200 hours of training over the last three years. Join our community. I have another class that's agnostic. They can come into, call it, securing listings with the wealthy. I do that three to four times a year. Soon to be the continued education class. So what we're also doing, DJ, that, you know, that continuing education class that I'm offering to REALTORS, I'm also offering it to financial planners. It'll be a C class for financial planner. And I'm also offering it for consumers. Consumers can learn what you should be learning. And then they're going to go seek out a real estate wealth advisor. And those people are going to win. I love it. Donahara is our guest today. He is the leader of the Keller Williams real estate planner and the AHara team in Oahu. He is, by the way, Dan has clients that move from the island to the mainland and back and forth. So if you are a real turn area that feeds into Oahu or the surrounding islands and or vice versa, Dan would like to partner with you. So if you have opportunities there where you have clients that have vacation homes or maybe retiring out to Hawaii or moving in and out for whatever reason, definitely reach out to him and his team. They're the number one Keller Williams team on Oahu. And also reach out to him. If you are an agent on Oahu and you are looking to maybe get a better to see what else what else is out there with other teams. And what Dan offers is truly remarkable. Dan, I have talked to hundreds of REALTORS all over the country who offer all sorts of services. This is the most unique service set that I have ever experienced in my seven years. So I applaud you for what you're doing. Thank you. I really am so impressed with the holistic approach that you take to wealth transfer and seeing this as a consultative business versus a transactional business. And everyone says that. But you're actually doing it. Everyone says I don't see my clients as transactions and yet they are doing transactions. And I suspect you know it's not because agents are nefarious. They just don't know how to do more. And what you are doing is actually the next step. So I am so impressed with what you've built, what you continue to build, what your team has done, and what the businesses you've built have created. And the education that you've put out there so that others can learn. This is a truly, you truly an amazing REALTOR and wealth planner. And what an amazing thing to have you on our show. So on behalf of our audience, we thank Dan for his time today. Dan, by the way, Dan has to get in the water. He surfs every day. And oh, Andy has one to three client appointments every day. By the way, I always love when you go back to that one thing. Speaking of Keller Williams, the one thing. The one thing that you know you have to do every day. And he's like, I have to have one to three appointments. And that's why my pipeline is always full. You said that earlier. It's just like doing push-ups. I have to do push-ups every day or whatever that is for you. Because it is the boulder we push up the mountain every single day. Dan's for him. It's surfing and it's appointments. And he is doing it. So on behalf of the audience, we say thanks to Dan. On behalf of Dan and myself, we thank the audience for sticking around to the end of the show. Please support our sponsors.
