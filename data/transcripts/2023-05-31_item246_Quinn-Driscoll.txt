[00:04:54] Quinn, welcome to the show.
[00:04:55] Thank you so much.
[00:04:56] So happy to be here.
[00:04:57] I am just happy to talk to somebody with a lovely Minnesota accent.
[00:05:02] So you are from the Twin Cities and it's a very mild, but it's a lovely accent.
[00:05:07] And I've always been a fan of that the little affect that people in that area have.
[00:05:13] Are you originally from the area?
[00:05:14] I am originally from North Dakota.
[00:05:17] So you can hear it here.
[00:05:18] Oh, that's what I'm hearing.
[00:05:19] You can hear it more with the long o's.
[00:05:21] Yes.
[00:05:22] Sure.
[00:05:23] It's one of the,
[00:05:25] now I'm going to sound like I'm bragging.
[00:05:26] I'm not bragging because I had a job that took me all over the country.
[00:05:30] Wasn't like I planned out, but North Dakota is one of the
[00:05:33] six states I haven't yet been to.
[00:05:35] So one of these days, I'll make it over there.
[00:05:37] But Minneapolis and the Twin Cities is awesome.
[00:05:41] And you guys, one of the great, great bands, actually, they're a New York band,
[00:05:45] but they sing a lot about the about Minneapolis is the whole steady.
[00:05:49] So anyone out there wants to find a good rocket roll band, the whole steady.
[00:05:52] They've been around forever.
[00:05:53] They sing a lot about Minneapolis and Husk.
[00:05:55] Husker do, I think is also for me.
[00:05:56] Anyway, it doesn't.
[00:05:57] All right, let's get to the main thing here.
[00:05:59] Let's talk about, I could talk about music all day and bore our audience,
[00:06:02] but I don't want them to leave.
[00:06:03] So I want to, now my background, I actually was a
[00:06:07] financial advisor, not a CPA and certainly not,
[00:06:12] not having the credentials that you had.
[00:06:14] And this was a million years ago in a former life.
[00:06:17] But I find that we have here at our company, we've got almost 800 agents.
[00:06:22] And not only that, but I work with a lot of other agents at other firms
[00:06:27] because I volunteer with our local REALTOR association.
[00:06:30] And so I hear a lot about money management and it seems to be one of the big
[00:06:35] challenges of REALTOR because of course those commissions kind of roll in when
[00:06:39] they roll in.
[00:06:40] And sometimes we need to sort of smooth out that roller coaster ride.
[00:06:44] So I am, this is the first time in almost 500 episodes.
[00:06:47] I think that we've ever had a financial services person on.
[00:06:51] So I am super excited about any tips and tricks that you can help our audience
[00:06:55] to better, you get smooth out those bumps in the commission, pay out world.
[00:07:01] But before we get to that, how'd you get into, you know,
[00:07:04] dealing with with money and being a financial services person?
[00:07:08] Yeah.
[00:07:09] So my story like many, the story of many REALTOR is of an accidental entrepreneur.
[00:07:15] So I always pictured myself safe and snug in a little cubicle.
[00:07:20] Never thought from in a million years that I would be a corporate drop out with my own business.
[00:07:26] But I worked for 10 years in a very deadline driven high stress and perfection demanding job.
[00:07:36] So I did get the opportunity in that job to work with hundreds of small businesses and see behind
[00:07:43] the scenes of their financials.
[00:07:45] So that was such, you know, an interesting and weird and great experience.
[00:07:50] I was a CPA worked as you mentioned earlier as a business valuation advisor in the litigation space.
[00:07:59] So working as an expert witness, you know, keep putting one foot in front of the other.
[00:08:04] And one day it was like, you know, you look around and it was like, this is not another 30 years for me.
[00:08:11] So I realized that I had so much small business knowledge and experience that I wasn't able to share
[00:08:19] in a way that I really enjoyed.
[00:08:22] I live like we mentioned in the Twin Cities, which is very much a big corporate town.
[00:08:27] A lot of big employers here and literally didn't know anyone who was a CPA mother of two small children who was running a, you know, basically an online business.
[00:08:39] So it was a super scary leap to decide to go out on my own and very unnatural to be taking a risk.
[00:08:48] So CPAs not known for our big dreams and like just going for it.
[00:08:55] So, but you know what, I had to do it.
[00:08:58] So I just had to, I had to figure out a way that I could help the smallest small businesses that really don't get a lot of attention from, you know,
[00:09:11] they're priced out by CPA firms and they just don't have the, the attention of kind of the financial professionals world.
[00:09:21] But I also, you know, I knew that I could not have started my business if I had spent every dollar that I made along the way.
[00:09:32] So the money management piece of it is just so, you know, close to my heart from, you know, my professional background standpoint, but also personally just knowing like it is really scary to own your own business.
[00:09:48] And to the extent that I can help real estate agents and brokers get a handle on those money management issues.
[00:09:56] It is just such a good match for what I want to do.
[00:10:01] Here's how I know that the money management piece of being a REALTOR is difficult.
[00:10:07] I and my, my boss and my business partner created a commission advanced business simply to give people their commissions ahead of closing.
[00:10:17] And the only reason we need to even even the only reason this business even exists is because of the challenges that REALTORS face and don't let
[00:10:26] it not that we're doing anything wrong.
[00:10:27] We love our commission advanced business.
[00:10:29] We're grateful to be able to provide that service.
[00:10:32] But basically, you know, we're charging people 10% to give them a loan on their money, which is going to close, you know, in 20 days or whatever, whatever it is.
[00:10:40] And that's just how commission advanced businesses work.
[00:10:43] But that wouldn't be necessary if people maybe had some better spending habits or saving habits.
[00:10:50] And the challenge, of course, as a REALTOR is that is one of the least sort of impressed upon skills when somebody becomes a successful or even just a new REALTOR, you know, they're not, they're just trying to survive.
[00:11:03] They're trying to, you know, eat what they kill.
[00:11:05] They're trying to pay their bills, save for taxes.
[00:11:08] It's, and again, you were saying the smallest business as a REALTOR is about a small business if you're an individual practitioner as possible.
[00:11:17] So what are some of the first things that anyone who is listening, who is a REALTOR, who's not on a salary, which is unless you work at a company, maybe like Redfin or some of those have salary REALTORS, but everyone else is on their own.
[00:11:31] What are some suggestions that our audience can start taking advantage of to better, you know, handle their money?
[00:11:39] Yes, so one thing that I have noticed with real estate agents is that the people who are successful on the sales side are way ahead of anybody else because you have learned how to follow a system.
[00:11:58] So you know that if a system works, if your leadgen system works, that you are going to get sales.
[00:12:05] So it's the same concept for the expensive side.
[00:12:09] It's you, if you know what steps you should be taking, you know that you can implement those, right?
[00:12:16] So you're a hard worker, you're a go getter, you know that if you have the steps and you have, you know, the support and you know what to do, you can get it done.
[00:12:25] So the really interesting thing I think that just needs to be talked about a little bit is that with real estate agents, you have no problem talking about, you know, here is my sales volume for the year.
[00:12:42] Here is my gross commission income for the year.
[00:12:44] Everybody's sharing that with each other, you know, it's competitive.
[00:12:48] It's kind of fun to see who can be a top producer.
[00:12:52] But then it's like the conversation just stops there and not only does nobody talk about what it costs to run that business, but nobody talks about just nobody talks about the fact that you have to spend a lot of money to make a lot of money.
[00:13:11] So kind of just having that in your mind and being aware of the fact that, you know, there is a way to get a handle on your expenses.
[00:13:22] And just because nobody's talking about it doesn't mean that it's not really important.
[00:13:27] So the first very first step is once you have those commissions coming in, no matter how kind of rudimentary the system is, you have got to start tracking your expenses too.
[00:13:43] And what do you recommend as far as a tool to do that? There are obviously a million different tools. Do you have one that you prefer or is it whatever system you use is fine? Just pick one.
[00:13:54] I'm curious to get your thoughts for tracking expenses.
[00:13:57] Yes. So for tracking expenses, I always recommend number one, having at least one business bank account and at least an only one, I should say business credit card.
[00:14:12] So job one, separate your business and your personal finances and have that dedicated business account and dedicated business credit card.
[00:14:23] At this point in 2023, pretty much any bank, any credit card is going to have online tools for you.
[00:14:32] So whether it is allocation enabling where you can go through your credit card statement and say here's the category for all these things.
[00:14:41] That's a great thing to do. If that's how you like to do it, just even downloading at the end of the month to excel, the transaction data and going through and doing that yourself is a great way to do it too.
[00:14:57] You know, it doesn't need to be fancy. It doesn't need to be complicated. It's just starting with anything is really the best way to do it when it comes to tracking your expenses.
[00:15:10] And expenses, you know, I'm going to let's back up even prior to that because I, yes, we do want to track expenses when you need a system and you want separate accounts, so separate bank account, separate credit card.
[00:15:23] And you're going to make those purchases, but not everybody even understands.
[00:15:29] Well, I'm going to get off of expenses just for a moment because I realized I had a really important question.
[00:15:34] And this, I'm curious if you can speak to this. When should someone decide to either become an S corporation or continue on or maybe an LLC or continue on as an independent contractor.
[00:15:50] So when when we become REALTORS, we join a brokerage, almost certainly we're an independent contractor by default and we're going to get 10, 90 nines at the end of the year based on all the commission we've earned at what point does it make sense to possibly create your own corporation and then be an employee of your own corporation.
[00:16:11] For example, I have an S corporation. I'm not a practicing REALTOR, but I'm kind of paid the same way. So imagine that I'm basically a REALTOR. So I have an S corporation, I am a the sole employee of my company.
[00:16:23] Can you speak to to why agents may want to consider that as an option as well.
[00:16:28] Yeah, so I can speak to that a little bit. The first thing I would say is that you should have an LLC right at the beginning definitely make sure that you have that state filing status is usually LLC and then a federal employer identification number are kind of the two things you'll need those to open your business bank account to show that you are actually a business.
[00:16:54] So definitely start with an LLC right away. And that is a that's just start getting that separation from your business and your personal and start you know running your business as its own entity.
[00:17:08] And then from there, the you can still have an LLC that's taxed as an LLC versus an S corporation. So the time to switch to an S corporation is going to depend on your situation.
[00:17:26] Yeah, the amount of income you're generating for the business. Yeah, so I don't have a you know hard and fast number. I would say that is something that you would want to talk to your tax advisor about and definitely have a tax advisor.
[00:17:42] Yes, I remember when I set up the S corp it was suggested to me when I got to around and this is a long time ago, but I think it was around maybe $80,000 in in salary or in commission or whatever income maybe was $100,000 somewhere in that neighborhood is when it started to make sense to explore S corporation versus you know another system.
[00:18:06] So again, please get yourself a tax accountant somebody that can actually answer these questions because we're talking about massive tax tax savings. And for those of you that aren't familiar with as corporation, one of the cool things is if it's you if it's your company and you're an employee of it, you actually technically have access to the entire assets under under the company.
[00:18:30] Now you'll pay yourself a salary and you can pay yourself what I think the IRS says is a fair and reasonable salary, which you can get calculated through your tax advisor, but I am telling you this is probably the biggest missed opportunity that many successful REALTORS have not explored is creating some sort of whether it's S corporation or LLC whatever.
[00:18:52] And understanding why you want to be an employee of your own company and why there's you know it's kind of like when you buy a home and all of a sudden you realize oh my gosh the tax benefits from the mortgage interest are really great.
[00:19:07] And you didn't really understand that before this is the same sort of deal. You can reduce your tax liability to for personal income when you have an S corporation to very, very low.
[00:19:18] So anyway, we can move off of that, but please everybody get yourself a CPA and if you don't have one reach out to Quinn, she is the best.
[00:19:28] So let's jump forward to commissions because this is what our audience cares about. This is how they get paid. This is how they eat lunch.
[00:19:35] So commission comes in now what how do we start like how much of that should I put aside for taxes. How should I do that what what are some strategies just to make it as automated as possible.
[00:19:47] So I don't spend it all.
[00:19:49] Yes, so the first thing that you want to think about is you know your commission checks are not the same as your paychecks.
[00:19:57] So start with that mindset of exactly like you're saying as soon as it comes in if you have you know if it's already spent or if you're thinking okay I know exactly where this whole thing is going.
[00:20:09] So you need to stop right there because that's what's going to keep you on that roller coaster. So you you really want to start with the system.
[00:20:20] A percentage based system to allocate each and every one of those commission checks that's coming in. So it depends on the size of your business revenue wise, but for the smallest businesses if you're under 250,000 in revenue.
[00:20:37] What I suggest starting with is about 15% for tax savings and target 30% for for your business expenses and 50% to pay yourself.
[00:20:53] So if you think through that every commission check that comes in at 50% is what's available to you to pay yourself that is a good place to start.
[00:21:04] I think the mindset is so important. It's a depressing a little bit of a depressing mindset as I see a commission and I divide it in half and go okay that's really what I get to to spend.
[00:21:16] So I understand the inclination to look at the entirety of it, but I think when you have these kind of systems in place and you just automatically like you were saying allocate to you know retirement to taxes.
[00:21:29] You then start to look at your commissions differently and you're right it's not a paycheck. It's a it's a it's a sum of money some of which you can use as a paycheck.
[00:21:42] Right and and that mindset is really important to set you up like we said to be off the roller coaster. So let's say that you've decided you are going to you want $5,000 a month to go to you for your living expenses just as an example.
[00:21:58] So that means if you have a $10,000 a month great 5,000 going to you perfect if you have a $20,000 a month.
[00:22:08] Then 5,000 is going to you and 5,000 gets to kind of you know hang around until you actually need it maybe the next month when you don't get 20,000.
[00:22:20] So it's the the mindset of what is available to me for my personal paychecks is different from what I'm actually going to take out every single time. So I should say there's a kind of a distinction there of the paycheck it or the commission check is deposited 50% is available to you.
[00:22:44] So that's not going to be available but that doesn't necessarily mean that's going to be the amount that you take out you're going to have a regular amount that is consistent coming to you.
[00:22:54] I want to go back to expenses for just a moment and I will want to tell you about something that really transform my life as a I'm a creative person mostly which means I'm not particularly strong at the financial side of business.
[00:23:08] I'm good at creating ideas and you know being goofy and that you know doing podcasts and things like that but what I'm not good at is managing money.
[00:23:18] So what I did is I I never in my life had actually had a budget and it sounds so simple for people that have budgets like how can you run a business without a budget.
[00:23:30] Well I didn't and how do you run your personal life without a budget well I never did so I think three years ago I started using you need a budget which is an app online it's a web app it's like maybe
[00:23:41] it's like hundred bucks a year or something like that I am telling you it complete I was able with three minutes a day now I spent not even three minutes maybe two minutes a day I'm able to reconcile all of my expenses I'm able to see where I'm spending my money all of my accounts get pulled into one location one website.
[00:23:59] Everything gets gets dropped there and I can literally account for almost every single dollar that comes in or goes out it sounds like a lot of work once you get the hang of it even for somebody like me who's not numbers minded at all it's actually really really easy to figure out and it helps you really track the ins and outs so I'm curious if if you have any thoughts on budgeting.
[00:24:23] Yes so I am curious about what made you kind of take the leap to become a budget person because a lot of people they just have a negative connotation of budget like it's deprived you know what I mean so if you were willing to share.
[00:24:39] Well I just I knew that I was so here was here was my the impetus for me doing it I suspect a lot of our listeners can can relate to this I was like I bet I'm spending too much money in certain areas of my life that aren't necessarily obvious like yeah okay if we go to Starbucks every day and we spend $10 or whatever then you that's pretty obvious but there are like little things like subscription fees that I wasn't realizing how many of those I have.
[00:25:07] I was how much am I spending on restaurants and dining out in entertainment how much am I actually I just wanted to know what percentage of my expenditures are for the things that I think are healthy and reasonable and when you know when everything is two taps away on your phone and it's not you're not physically handing over cash and receiving cash back everything's digital it's invisible it doesn't feel like anything and I knew that it's so much easier to you know get Amazon.
[00:25:37] And boxes delivered every day and not think about the total amount I'm actually spending right so it was for me it was because I'm it's so easy to buy things I wanted to make it a little just have like a little checks and balances because I know I'm not going to stop buying things but I wanted to know how do I at least keep it in the front of my mind of how much am I actually spending.
[00:26:00] Yes, so one thing that I find really helps a lot of business owners on both the business and personal side is before you start thinking about making a budget and that seems like scary and a lot of work is to look back at what you have actually spent as a starting point so a lot of times I will get into you know working with a client and we'll pull up their quick books financials and I'll be like okay so we have general business expense.
[00:26:30] I'm going to ask you a couple of questions from you to a couple of other questions that I want to tell you guys about it and what was your business expense here 30 thousand dollars last year like let's talk about what that is and I give everybody a many hard attack with this question because they're like 30 thousand dollars like I don't know but then when we get into it it's like oh yeah okay that that was this and that was you know all yeah these things I guess that does add up to 30 thousand so that makes sense.
[00:26:50] So it's the kind of the process of the information gathering and the getting through the shock of what the actual numbers are.
[00:26:59] And then realizing like, okay, yeah, it actually this does make sense and this is necessary.
[00:27:05] And so now I can feel good about that number in my budget because I know that it's real.
[00:27:11] And it's I've done it before it's doable or the other way around like, oh, I can't believe I spent that much money and didn't get anything out of it.
[00:27:21] So I'm you know, then it's easy to be like, no, I'm not going to do that anymore.
[00:27:26] So yeah, it's really once you start kind of getting the information and getting past that I don't want to look at it like I don't want to log on to my bank account or I don't want to log on to my quick books because I'm worried about what I'm going to find.
[00:27:39] Yeah, that's the hardest part, I think.
[00:27:42] It is it is the hardest part and it is uncomfortable, but that discomfort quickly changes to comfort because what it allows what it does is it creates this feeling of responsibility and power.
[00:27:58] So initially, yes, I totally am with you that it's scary. It's sort of like, oh, my God, I don't want to like it's like looking at looking at yourself naked in the mirror and seeing all the imperfections.
[00:28:09] You're like, I don't really want to do that.
[00:28:11] But once you start going, okay, now I'm going to start targeting these areas of my expenses.
[00:28:17] There are so many REALTORS who work incredibly hard and build up amazing businesses, treat their clients well, really go above and beyond and then because of their inefficient ways or ineffective ways of managing their money are broke.
[00:28:33] And this is or or even worse, I'll hear somebody at an event, a REALTOR event say, I need to put a new addition on my house, meaning I need to go sell it and they'll say I need to sell another home to do that.
[00:28:45] And I'm again, I understand that. I mean, we can think like that. That's fine. But instead of thinking transactionally, let's come up with a process to where you can have more regular income prediction.
[00:28:59] So that you're more predictable stream so that you're not worried about, okay, I got to come up with another 10 grand to pay my taxes this quarter, right, which is which is what happens.
[00:29:11] So the good news for all of you out there listening who are like, I'm not good at managing money.
[00:29:16] You can hire people to help you do this. They're ridiculously inexpensive in my experience.
[00:29:23] They're super helpful and they will protect you from going broke. If nothing else, you should have a fear of going broke. I don't mean you should be terrified, but you should have a healthy fear of losing all of your money because the reality of as REALTOR has to do everything.
[00:29:40] They have to wear every single hat that a business owner has to wear. And you know, the skill sets that make you a great REALTOR might not be the same skill sets to be a great financial planner.
[00:29:51] So which is why, you know, some people like Quinn are so important to our industry. Quinn, what are some of the mistakes that you've seen REALTORS make with respect to poor sort of money management?
[00:30:06] Yeah, so I think the first thing in the number one thing is spending the commission check before it even hits the bank.
[00:30:15] You know, you know what you're going to spend it on. And so really starting out right away with that allocation system.
[00:30:23] And I like how you use the word target because that is a great way to think about it. Like, hey, you might not be hitting your targets for expenses or, you know, anything in your business, but that's okay.
[00:30:36] It's just a, it's just a checkpoint, right? It's, I'm going to check in with this and figure out am I on target and am I not on target and what do I need to do to fix that.
[00:30:46] So I think the, you know, just having kind of a regular check in on what is happening with your money is huge.
[00:30:56] So many clients who I work with are kind of blown away when we start working with a commission pipeline.
[00:31:05] So that's kind of a fancy way to say what deals are closing in the next two months and how much are you expecting to get from that.
[00:31:14] Let's let's put it on a literal calendar. So you can see when money is coming into your business and just doing that and updating it on a weekly basis is like it's so helpful to give you that clarity of like, oh, if this is my revenue goal for this quarter.
[00:31:31] And I have this much coming in. I'm actually, yeah, I'm going to hit that goal or like, no, I'm not and I don't have anything else cooking.
[00:31:41] So, you know, this is probably not the best time to be blowing up with a huge client event or something like that, you know.
[00:31:48] So it's, it's having the check ins on a weekly basis. I recommend with your commissions and your expenses to just start, start having that flow of information where you know where you stand.
[00:32:06] Yeah, it's the idea of like it's like stepping on a scale. None of us want to do it. But if we make a habit of it, we can start to notice trends. Right. We don't need to know every moment of the day what our financial bottom line is, but we need to know where it's headed.
[00:32:22] Right. So we need to know, are we heading in the right direction? Are we on top of it? Are we aware? Are we paying our bills?
[00:32:30] Just working to sort of, you know, outpace expenses, you know, is this sort of cycle that REALTORS get into, right? It's like, I've got expenses sell a home.
[00:32:41] You know, and it kind of cycles through and it can be very stressful. And what we're really talking about is minimizing anxiety.
[00:32:50] What we really want to do is your job is hard enough as a REALTOR. It's already anxiety written and difficult. And let's make the financial part of it.
[00:33:03] The end goal, the actual where when you're celebrating in the end zone with the touchdown, let's make that the easiest part of the transaction, meaning let's not worry about overspending.
[00:33:15] You work so hard for this. Let's set up systems to automatically delineate those assets as they come in to separate accounts. Let's save some for retirement. Let's save some for taxes. Let's put some back into the business. Let's pay our bills.
[00:33:31] But also, let's evaluate our expenditures. Quinn says weekly, I would even say, look at your expenses daily, which by the way, you can get down to about one minute if you use, you know, like mint.com or you need a budget is the one I use.
[00:33:46] But a lot of these these web apps are so helpful because they can literally pull all the data from the various accounts, put it in one dashboard for you. And you can just kind of do a check in. And by the way, I found a, even just, I mean, it sounds so silly to say this, but like I found somebody charged me $300 for something that I didn't recognize last month. And I was like, oh, and I got the money back because it was, it was actually a mistake.
[00:34:11] So if I wasn't paying attention to that, I would have just paid it.
[00:34:15] Right. And let me tell you from personal experience, if you have children who are on the iPad, who are buying sneaky apps, you got to get a handle on that before it gets out of hand and they've bought like all the, you know, robots characters or whatever it is. So check the statements.
[00:34:33] Holarias, yeah, yeah, kids and the micro transactions, we need to evaluate this again, guys, what we're trying to help you do is really take the hardest part of the business, the financial management part, the business part of it out so that you can be as, you know, focus on what you do best, which is getting in front of clients helping clients buy and sell homes.
[00:34:55] So Quinn is, this is what she does. So talk about how do you help REALTORS better sort of plan for the future.
[00:35:05] Yeah, so I teach a five part system. It's the acronym is clear. So CLE, AR, commissions, lifestyle, expenses, allocation and return.
[00:35:16] Those are the five areas that we are looking at to figure out is everything, you know, at the level that it needs to be so that things are working together. So the C commissions piece, you know, that's obviously the money coming into your business.
[00:35:32] If you're, if you have a successful real estate agency, you have your lead gen, you have your sales, you have your money coming into the business. That's great because the other pieces are the parts that you can honestly control yourself, the commissions pieces of the piece that's most out of your control.
[00:35:51] So once you got that piece down on the rest of it is actually a lot easier to deal with. So the L is for lifestyle. So we talk about, you know, how are you spending your time, your money and your energy in your life, not just in your business, but with your family, with your health, with your community involvement, all of those types of things to understand, you know, are you doing the things that you want to be doing and how is your money helping you with that.
[00:36:21] The next piece is expenses as we've talked about. So looking at what you are spending your money on both in your business and we can look at your personal to if that is something that's helpful to you.
[00:36:34] But to get into those details and I am there to, you know, not shame you or tell you that you're doing everything wrong. I think a lot of people get worried about that. Like, this is, it's so bad. I just don't even want anybody to know, but, you know what, I've seen it all. Don't worry about it. We're going to get in there and we're going to look at what you're spending your money on and are those things that make sense. Are those things that you need to be running your business the best way you can.
[00:37:05] Allocations, we have already talked about a little bit having those targeted percentages is really helpful so that every dollar that comes in you have a, you know, a mental map of where everything is going and you know that you're always going to have what you need available in your savings and then return. So looking at the, the ways you're spending your time and money.
[00:37:30] And what is the return that you're getting on those. So if you are running the same ads that you ran three years ago that did great for you.
[00:37:39] And you haven't looked at it lately like, am I actually getting any leads from these ads. Maybe that's a place where hey, that's a big chunk of budget that can go into a different type of ads or just, you know, into a different type of lead gen strategy.
[00:37:54] So really looking holistically at what are all the things that are happening.
[00:37:59] And what are the tactical steps that you need to take that I'm happy to help you with like is it we need to be on a zoom call and we're going to walk through logging into the bank account and we're going to cancel all the subscriptions that we don't use anymore.
[00:38:16] You know, so I am there to be accountability coaching advice, sounding board, you can vent like all of the things, you know, it could be a little bit of a therapy session because money is a tough, tough area for a lot of people.
[00:38:35] Money is really associated with lots of shame too. And that's that's the big thing I want everyone to it's again, it's the idea of getting naked and stepping on a scale. It's not an easy thing for everybody to do and it's hard enough to do using that same metaphor in you know, by yourself in your own bathroom alone.
[00:38:57] But then to then say here is me to the entire to someone else like yourself and say here's all of my financial nakedness.
[00:39:06] It can be a little tough and then people feel you know a certain ways about their past spending activity.
[00:39:15] But guys, what I will tell you is get over that people when you hire a CPA to help you with this, they don't care, they just want to help you.
[00:39:25] And so even if you are if you have negative equity or if you have credit card debt or whatever the situation may be that you're like, I wish I didn't or I wish I was in a different position.
[00:39:36] And get past that because what we really need to do is we want you to be able to pay your bills and plan for the future and build a successful business.
[00:39:48] So many REALTORS leave the industry not because they don't have enough business because they don't manage their finances.
[00:39:54] It's like the silent killer that nobody talks about in this industry because we are all talking about deals deals deals get more and more deals.
[00:40:02] And there isn't any sort of you know like if you go to the NFL and you're your football player and you can focus exclusively on the you know playing on the field and lifting weights and you know doing all of this the skill building that you need to do to be a good professional athlete.
[00:40:18] They have people in the background making sure that when you retire you have a pension coming in well that doesn't really exist for real estate.
[00:40:26] So you have to take control of that.
[00:40:29] Unfortunately that we haven't figured out a way to automate that for people.
[00:40:32] So a Quinn and people like Quinn are available to help you figure that out because there's nothing worse than working for 30 years to realize, oh I didn't save as much as I could have.
[00:40:44] Or even better I didn't take advantage of as much of the deductions that I could have right my dad did his own taxes he was a CPA but that wasn't his profession.
[00:40:56] But he did it for like 15 years many a long long long time ago and then finally he started going to a CPA and turns out that he had been doing it wrong the whole time.
[00:41:06] And the CPA was like I cannot believe you are not in my dad was unintentional but he was like can't believe you're not in jail.
[00:41:14] Not because I mean actually the might add over paid his taxes funny enough for like 15 years and so the IRS had to give us a big check.
[00:41:25] Basically don't try to do everything yourself get a professional go to the value gal dot com to learn all things Quinn Driscoll.
[00:41:35] She is going to help you manage your finances guys just hire somebody for this don't try to do it yourself it's too much you have too much too too many other things on your plate at once as a REALTOR don't put this on your plate hire somebody trust me my my CPA shout out to Debbie the crazy tax lady that's her her moniker which is hilarious.
[00:41:57] And she is not crazy but that's what she calls herself and Debbie is my savior she tells me every year like for example Quinn I'll talk about this going back to the beginning about like starting an S corporation one day Debbie called me and said hey do you have monthly meetings for your board of directors which by the way I'm the only person on the board of directors for my silly little company.
[00:42:22] Yes I she says well you can expense those and I can have two parties a year I think as well like a holiday party so there's all these cool little ways where you can take advantage in a in an ethical way of the IRS tax codes by maximizing your deduction deductions and your expenses but you need to go to a professional for this tax you know just doing it online maybe it would give you some of that you know using but going to a
[00:42:51] highly respected and competent CPA and money manager will will be able to help you figure that out and also we need to we just say for retirement too.
[00:43:04] Yeah we sure do.
[00:43:06] Was a lot.
[00:43:09] I was I was I was I was saying a lot there and I apologize for that but I was just trying to say money is it's the thing we don't talk about and in this industry.
[00:43:19] When what what are the first steps so so so we talked about the first steps being when the when when when commission first of all establish yourself as a LLC we talked about that and talked to a CPA about why that makes sense we talked about creating an allocation strategy when commissions come in they're automatically distributed to channels that we don't touch retirement taxes etc. expenditures and then we also talked about return on investment right like how do we add that we can't do that.
[00:43:48] Actually evaluate our our business expenses that are generating income for us and somebody like you can come along and take a look at all of our books and say okay this is working for you in this isn't where do you see REALTORS struggling the most when they hire somebody like you.
[00:44:11] That is a great question so.
[00:44:14] So.
[00:44:17] Struggling them I think this the struggle is at the very beginning of just getting over the I haven't done everything right and I know I haven't and so I just feel like I'm going to be judged or I feel like you know there.
[00:44:34] A lot of people honestly will be like I don't want to feel like I'm getting in trouble in math class again because I'm not good with numbers you know so it's really those kind of deep seated emotional shame shame shame it is the shame so.
[00:44:51] So that's tricky but it's it's kind of like once you once you make the commitment I think making the commitment is the hardest thing that you are going to you're going to jump in you're going to do it it's going to be not perfect at the beginning it's going to take.
[00:45:07] You're going to try stuff and it's not going to work and then you're going to try something else and you're going to forget the other thing you were supposed to do and that's okay it's all part of the process so.
[00:45:16] You know just being okay with that as much as you can when you are like an overachiever you know like a lot of a lot of the top producers and high performing agents are it's hard to let those kind of vulnerabilities show a little bit.
[00:45:34] So I think that's honestly the hardest piece I've had so many top producers on our show talk about I I was my gross commission income was 500,000 or a million.
[00:45:46] So I was like $1.00 and I had no savings like people would say yes on paper it looks like I am incredibly successful because of all of these transactions and yet I really have nothing to show for the bank and that's where this guilt or shame comes in of like I don't really want people to peel back the curtain and see but the only way out of that it's funny I'm pretty confident in saying the only way to expel shame is by bringing it into the light meaning expose yourself.
[00:46:16] To somebody who can help guide you through so even if you feel crummy about your current financials and by the way little pro tip for everyone are a little truth bomb everybody feels crappy about their financial situation all the time nobody feels like I've got enough money I mean maybe one tenth of 1% of the population maybe feels that way for the rest of us everybody once more money everybody wants to save more spend less we all feel like I should.
[00:46:46] Do better right so you're total totally normal to feel like I should be spending less and saving more and I should be earning more right like that's totally totally normal so don't worry find somebody like Quinn so quit the best way that our audience can can.
[00:47:02] And by the way pick a CPA that has experience dealing with REALTORS because they understand Quinn for example understands the REALTOR money sort of circle she understands that process pick somebody who gets working with small independent businesses like yourself like like REALTORS but please for everything to learn about Quinn and what she offers go to the value of the market.
[00:47:32] You gal calm also want you to follow her on instagram at value gal Quinn will have links to the Instagram and her website and the show notes Quinn any last tips or advice for our audience.
[00:47:45] Yes so I think as you just as you just alluded to everybody thinks that they are the actual worst with money and that everyone else has it all figured out that is not that is not correct nobody has it figured out everybody just doing their best so you know just do your best and if you do need help with it find somebody to help you and my other my other thing I would say is that you know cut us CPAs and you know cut us.
[00:48:14] And accounting brains a little bit of slack we're not trying to be confusing or like you know just giving you the profit and last statement and talking our weird language that doesn't make any sense to you that's just that's just what we know so ask the questions ask so many questions we really want you to feel good about where you are with your money so if you don't understand something just ask your ask your financial person to explain it again.
[00:48:44] A different way you know just keep asking until you get it because they are here to help you.

Go to her website, thevaluegal.com and also find her on Instagram at value gal Quinn QI double N value gal Quinn. Quinn, welcome to the show. Thank you so much. So happy to be here. I am just happy to talk to somebody with a lovely Minnesota accent. So you are from the Twin Cities and it's a very mild, but it's a lovely accent. And I've always been a fan of that the little affect that people in that area have. Are you originally from the area? I am originally from North Dakota. So you can hear it here. Oh, that's what I'm hearing. You can hear it more with the long o's. Yes. Sure. It's one of the, now I'm going to sound like I'm bragging. I'm not bragging because I had a job that took me all over the country. Wasn't like I planned out, but North Dakota is one of the six states I haven't yet been to. So one of these days, I'll make it over there. But Minneapolis and the Twin Cities is awesome. And you guys, one of the great, great bands, actually, they're a New York band, but they sing a lot about the about Minneapolis is the whole steady. So anyone out there wants to find a good rocket roll band, the whole steady. They've been around forever. They sing a lot about Minneapolis and Husk. Husker do, I think is also for me. Anyway, it doesn't. All right, let's get to the main thing here. Let's talk about, I could talk about music all day and bore our audience, but I don't want them to leave. So I want to, now my background, I actually was a financial advisor, not a CPA and certainly not, not having the credentials that you had. And this was a million years ago in a former life. But I find that we have here at our company, we've got almost 800 agents. And not only that, but I work with a lot of other agents at other firms because I volunteer with our local REALTOR association. And so I hear a lot about money management and it seems to be one of the big challenges of REALTOR because of course those commissions kind of roll in when they roll in. And sometimes we need to sort of smooth out that roller coaster ride. So I am, this is the first time in almost 500 episodes. I think that we've ever had a financial services person on. So I am super excited about any tips and tricks that you can help our audience to better, you get smooth out those bumps in the commission, pay out world. But before we get to that, how'd you get into, you know, dealing with with money and being a financial services person? Yeah. So my story like many, the story of many REALTOR is of an accidental entrepreneur. So I always pictured myself safe and snug in a little cubicle. Never thought from in a million years that I would be a corporate drop out with my own business. But I worked for 10 years in a very deadline driven high stress and perfection demanding job. So I did get the opportunity in that job to work with hundreds of small businesses and see behind the scenes of their financials. So that was such, you know, an interesting and weird and great experience. I was a CPA worked as you mentioned earlier as a business valuation advisor in the litigation space. So working as an expert witness, you know, keep putting one foot in front of the other. And one day it was like, you know, you look around and it was like, this is not another 30 years for me. So I realized that I had so much small business knowledge and experience that I wasn't able to share in a way that I really enjoyed. I live like we mentioned in the Twin Cities, which is very much a big corporate town. A lot of big employers here and literally didn't know anyone who was a CPA mother of two small children who was running a, you know, basically an online business. So it was a super scary leap to decide to go out on my own and very unnatural to be taking a risk. So CPAs not known for our big dreams and like just going for it. So, but you know what, I had to do it. So I just had to, I had to figure out a way that I could help the smallest small businesses that really don't get a lot of attention from, you know, they're priced out by CPA firms and they just don't have the, the attention of kind of the financial professionals world. But I also, you know, I knew that I could not have started my business if I had spent every dollar that I made along the way. So the money management piece of it is just so, you know, close to my heart from, you know, my professional background standpoint, but also personally just knowing like it is really scary to own your own business. And to the extent that I can help real estate agents and brokers get a handle on those money management issues. It is just such a good match for what I want to do. Here's how I know that the money management piece of being a REALTOR is difficult. I and my, my boss and my business partner created a commission advanced business simply to give people their commissions ahead of closing. And the only reason we need to even even the only reason this business even exists is because of the challenges that REALTORS face and don't let it not that we're doing anything wrong. We love our commission advanced business. We're grateful to be able to provide that service. But basically, you know, we're charging people 10% to give them a loan on their money, which is going to close, you know, in 20 days or whatever, whatever it is. And that's just how commission advanced businesses work. But that wouldn't be necessary if people maybe had some better spending habits or saving habits. And the challenge, of course, as a REALTOR is that is one of the least sort of impressed upon skills when somebody becomes a successful or even just a new REALTOR, you know, they're not, they're just trying to survive. They're trying to, you know, eat what they kill. They're trying to pay their bills, save for taxes. It's, and again, you were saying the smallest business as a REALTOR is about a small business if you're an individual practitioner as possible. So what are some of the first things that anyone who is listening, who is a REALTOR, who's not on a salary, which is unless you work at a company, maybe like Redfin or some of those have salary REALTORS, but everyone else is on their own. What are some suggestions that our audience can start taking advantage of to better, you know, handle their money? Yes, so one thing that I have noticed with real estate agents is that the people who are successful on the sales side are way ahead of anybody else because you have learned how to follow a system. So you know that if a system works, if your leadgen system works, that you are going to get sales. So it's the same concept for the expensive side. It's you, if you know what steps you should be taking, you know that you can implement those, right? So you're a hard worker, you're a go getter, you know that if you have the steps and you have, you know, the support and you know what to do, you can get it done. So the really interesting thing I think that just needs to be talked about a little bit is that with real estate agents, you have no problem talking about, you know, here is my sales volume for the year. Here is my gross commission income for the year. Everybody's sharing that with each other, you know, it's competitive. It's kind of fun to see who can be a top producer. But then it's like the conversation just stops there and not only does nobody talk about what it costs to run that business, but nobody talks about just nobody talks about the fact that you have to spend a lot of money to make a lot of money. So kind of just having that in your mind and being aware of the fact that, you know, there is a way to get a handle on your expenses. And just because nobody's talking about it doesn't mean that it's not really important. So the first very first step is once you have those commissions coming in, no matter how kind of rudimentary the system is, you have got to start tracking your expenses too. And what do you recommend as far as a tool to do that? There are obviously a million different tools. Do you have one that you prefer or is it whatever system you use is fine? Just pick one. I'm curious to get your thoughts for tracking expenses. Yes. So for tracking expenses, I always recommend number one, having at least one business bank account and at least an only one, I should say business credit card. So job one, separate your business and your personal finances and have that dedicated business account and dedicated business credit card. At this point in 2023, pretty much any bank, any credit card is going to have online tools for you. So whether it is allocation enabling where you can go through your credit card statement and say here's the category for all these things. That's a great thing to do. If that's how you like to do it, just even downloading at the end of the month to excel, the transaction data and going through and doing that yourself is a great way to do it too. You know, it doesn't need to be fancy. It doesn't need to be complicated. It's just starting with anything is really the best way to do it when it comes to tracking your expenses. And expenses, you know, I'm going to let's back up even prior to that because I, yes, we do want to track expenses when you need a system and you want separate accounts, so separate bank account, separate credit card. And you're going to make those purchases, but not everybody even understands. Well, I'm going to get off of expenses just for a moment because I realized I had a really important question. And this, I'm curious if you can speak to this. When should someone decide to either become an S corporation or continue on or maybe an LLC or continue on as an independent contractor. So when when we become REALTORS, we join a brokerage, almost certainly we're an independent contractor by default and we're going to get 10, 90 nines at the end of the year based on all the commission we've earned at what point does it make sense to possibly create your own corporation and then be an employee of your own corporation. For example, I have an S corporation. I'm not a practicing REALTOR, but I'm kind of paid the same way. So imagine that I'm basically a REALTOR. So I have an S corporation, I am a the sole employee of my company. Can you speak to to why agents may want to consider that as an option as well. Yeah, so I can speak to that a little bit. The first thing I would say is that you should have an LLC right at the beginning definitely make sure that you have that state filing status is usually LLC and then a federal employer identification number are kind of the two things you'll need those to open your business bank account to show that you are actually a business. So definitely start with an LLC right away. And that is a that's just start getting that separation from your business and your personal and start you know running your business as its own entity. And then from there, the you can still have an LLC that's taxed as an LLC versus an S corporation. So the time to switch to an S corporation is going to depend on your situation. Yeah, the amount of income you're generating for the business. Yeah, so I don't have a you know hard and fast number. I would say that is something that you would want to talk to your tax advisor about and definitely have a tax advisor. Yes, I remember when I set up the S corp it was suggested to me when I got to around and this is a long time ago, but I think it was around maybe $80,000 in in salary or in commission or whatever income maybe was $100,000 somewhere in that neighborhood is when it started to make sense to explore S corporation versus you know another system. So again, please get yourself a tax accountant somebody that can actually answer these questions because we're talking about massive tax tax savings. And for those of you that aren't familiar with as corporation, one of the cool things is if it's you if it's your company and you're an employee of it, you actually technically have access to the entire assets under under the company. Now you'll pay yourself a salary and you can pay yourself what I think the IRS says is a fair and reasonable salary, which you can get calculated through your tax advisor, but I am telling you this is probably the biggest missed opportunity that many successful REALTORS have not explored is creating some sort of whether it's S corporation or LLC whatever. And understanding why you want to be an employee of your own company and why there's you know it's kind of like when you buy a home and all of a sudden you realize oh my gosh the tax benefits from the mortgage interest are really great. And you didn't really understand that before this is the same sort of deal. You can reduce your tax liability to for personal income when you have an S corporation to very, very low. So anyway, we can move off of that, but please everybody get yourself a CPA and if you don't have one reach out to Quinn, she is the best. So let's jump forward to commissions because this is what our audience cares about. This is how they get paid. This is how they eat lunch. So commission comes in now what how do we start like how much of that should I put aside for taxes. How should I do that what what are some strategies just to make it as automated as possible. So I don't spend it all. Yes, so the first thing that you want to think about is you know your commission checks are not the same as your paychecks. So start with that mindset of exactly like you're saying as soon as it comes in if you have you know if it's already spent or if you're thinking okay I know exactly where this whole thing is going. So you need to stop right there because that's what's going to keep you on that roller coaster. So you you really want to start with the system. A percentage based system to allocate each and every one of those commission checks that's coming in. So it depends on the size of your business revenue wise, but for the smallest businesses if you're under 250,000 in revenue. What I suggest starting with is about 15% for tax savings and target 30% for for your business expenses and 50% to pay yourself. So if you think through that every commission check that comes in at 50% is what's available to you to pay yourself that is a good place to start. I think the mindset is so important. It's a depressing a little bit of a depressing mindset as I see a commission and I divide it in half and go okay that's really what I get to to spend. So I understand the inclination to look at the entirety of it, but I think when you have these kind of systems in place and you just automatically like you were saying allocate to you know retirement to taxes. You then start to look at your commissions differently and you're right it's not a paycheck. It's a it's a it's a sum of money some of which you can use as a paycheck. Right and and that mindset is really important to set you up like we said to be off the roller coaster. So let's say that you've decided you are going to you want $5,000 a month to go to you for your living expenses just as an example. So that means if you have a $10,000 a month great 5,000 going to you perfect if you have a $20,000 a month. Then 5,000 is going to you and 5,000 gets to kind of you know hang around until you actually need it maybe the next month when you don't get 20,000. So it's the the mindset of what is available to me for my personal paychecks is different from what I'm actually going to take out every single time. So I should say there's a kind of a distinction there of the paycheck it or the commission check is deposited 50% is available to you. So that's not going to be available but that doesn't necessarily mean that's going to be the amount that you take out you're going to have a regular amount that is consistent coming to you. I want to go back to expenses for just a moment and I will want to tell you about something that really transform my life as a I'm a creative person mostly which means I'm not particularly strong at the financial side of business. I'm good at creating ideas and you know being goofy and that you know doing podcasts and things like that but what I'm not good at is managing money. So what I did is I I never in my life had actually had a budget and it sounds so simple for people that have budgets like how can you run a business without a budget. Well I didn't and how do you run your personal life without a budget well I never did so I think three years ago I started using you need a budget which is an app online it's a web app it's like maybe it's like hundred bucks a year or something like that I am telling you it complete I was able with three minutes a day now I spent not even three minutes maybe two minutes a day I'm able to reconcile all of my expenses I'm able to see where I'm spending my money all of my accounts get pulled into one location one website. Everything gets gets dropped there and I can literally account for almost every single dollar that comes in or goes out it sounds like a lot of work once you get the hang of it even for somebody like me who's not numbers minded at all it's actually really really easy to figure out and it helps you really track the ins and outs so I'm curious if if you have any thoughts on budgeting. Yes so I am curious about what made you kind of take the leap to become a budget person because a lot of people they just have a negative connotation of budget like it's deprived you know what I mean so if you were willing to share. Well I just I knew that I was so here was here was my the impetus for me doing it I suspect a lot of our listeners can can relate to this I was like I bet I'm spending too much money in certain areas of my life that aren't necessarily obvious like yeah okay if we go to Starbucks every day and we spend $10 or whatever then you that's pretty obvious but there are like little things like subscription fees that I wasn't realizing how many of those I have. I was how much am I spending on restaurants and dining out in entertainment how much am I actually I just wanted to know what percentage of my expenditures are for the things that I think are healthy and reasonable and when you know when everything is two taps away on your phone and it's not you're not physically handing over cash and receiving cash back everything's digital it's invisible it doesn't feel like anything and I knew that it's so much easier to you know get Amazon. And boxes delivered every day and not think about the total amount I'm actually spending right so it was for me it was because I'm it's so easy to buy things I wanted to make it a little just have like a little checks and balances because I know I'm not going to stop buying things but I wanted to know how do I at least keep it in the front of my mind of how much am I actually spending. Yes, so one thing that I find really helps a lot of business owners on both the business and personal side is before you start thinking about making a budget and that seems like scary and a lot of work is to look back at what you have actually spent as a starting point so a lot of times I will get into you know working with a client and we'll pull up their quick books financials and I'll be like okay so we have general business expense. I'm going to ask you a couple of questions from you to a couple of other questions that I want to tell you guys about it and what was your business expense here 30 thousand dollars last year like let's talk about what that is and I give everybody a many hard attack with this question because they're like 30 thousand dollars like I don't know but then when we get into it it's like oh yeah okay that that was this and that was you know all yeah these things I guess that does add up to 30 thousand so that makes sense. So it's the kind of the process of the information gathering and the getting through the shock of what the actual numbers are. And then realizing like, okay, yeah, it actually this does make sense and this is necessary. And so now I can feel good about that number in my budget because I know that it's real. And it's I've done it before it's doable or the other way around like, oh, I can't believe I spent that much money and didn't get anything out of it. So I'm you know, then it's easy to be like, no, I'm not going to do that anymore. So yeah, it's really once you start kind of getting the information and getting past that I don't want to look at it like I don't want to log on to my bank account or I don't want to log on to my quick books because I'm worried about what I'm going to find. Yeah, that's the hardest part, I think. It is it is the hardest part and it is uncomfortable, but that discomfort quickly changes to comfort because what it allows what it does is it creates this feeling of responsibility and power. So initially, yes, I totally am with you that it's scary. It's sort of like, oh, my God, I don't want to like it's like looking at looking at yourself naked in the mirror and seeing all the imperfections. You're like, I don't really want to do that. But once you start going, okay, now I'm going to start targeting these areas of my expenses. There are so many REALTORS who work incredibly hard and build up amazing businesses, treat their clients well, really go above and beyond and then because of their inefficient ways or ineffective ways of managing their money are broke. And this is or or even worse, I'll hear somebody at an event, a REALTOR event say, I need to put a new addition on my house, meaning I need to go sell it and they'll say I need to sell another home to do that. And I'm again, I understand that. I mean, we can think like that. That's fine. But instead of thinking transactionally, let's come up with a process to where you can have more regular income prediction. So that you're more predictable stream so that you're not worried about, okay, I got to come up with another 10 grand to pay my taxes this quarter, right, which is which is what happens. So the good news for all of you out there listening who are like, I'm not good at managing money. You can hire people to help you do this. They're ridiculously inexpensive in my experience. They're super helpful and they will protect you from going broke. If nothing else, you should have a fear of going broke. I don't mean you should be terrified, but you should have a healthy fear of losing all of your money because the reality of as REALTOR has to do everything. They have to wear every single hat that a business owner has to wear. And you know, the skill sets that make you a great REALTOR might not be the same skill sets to be a great financial planner. So which is why, you know, some people like Quinn are so important to our industry. Quinn, what are some of the mistakes that you've seen REALTORS make with respect to poor sort of money management? Yeah, so I think the first thing in the number one thing is spending the commission check before it even hits the bank. You know, you know what you're going to spend it on. And so really starting out right away with that allocation system. And I like how you use the word target because that is a great way to think about it. Like, hey, you might not be hitting your targets for expenses or, you know, anything in your business, but that's okay. It's just a, it's just a checkpoint, right? It's, I'm going to check in with this and figure out am I on target and am I not on target and what do I need to do to fix that. So I think the, you know, just having kind of a regular check in on what is happening with your money is huge. So many clients who I work with are kind of blown away when we start working with a commission pipeline. So that's kind of a fancy way to say what deals are closing in the next two months and how much are you expecting to get from that. Let's let's put it on a literal calendar. So you can see when money is coming into your business and just doing that and updating it on a weekly basis is like it's so helpful to give you that clarity of like, oh, if this is my revenue goal for this quarter. And I have this much coming in. I'm actually, yeah, I'm going to hit that goal or like, no, I'm not and I don't have anything else cooking. So, you know, this is probably not the best time to be blowing up with a huge client event or something like that, you know. So it's, it's having the check ins on a weekly basis. I recommend with your commissions and your expenses to just start, start having that flow of information where you know where you stand. Yeah, it's the idea of like it's like stepping on a scale. None of us want to do it. But if we make a habit of it, we can start to notice trends. Right. We don't need to know every moment of the day what our financial bottom line is, but we need to know where it's headed. Right. So we need to know, are we heading in the right direction? Are we on top of it? Are we aware? Are we paying our bills? Just working to sort of, you know, outpace expenses, you know, is this sort of cycle that REALTORS get into, right? It's like, I've got expenses sell a home. You know, and it kind of cycles through and it can be very stressful. And what we're really talking about is minimizing anxiety. What we really want to do is your job is hard enough as a REALTOR. It's already anxiety written and difficult. And let's make the financial part of it. The end goal, the actual where when you're celebrating in the end zone with the touchdown, let's make that the easiest part of the transaction, meaning let's not worry about overspending. You work so hard for this. Let's set up systems to automatically delineate those assets as they come in to separate accounts. Let's save some for retirement. Let's save some for taxes. Let's put some back into the business. Let's pay our bills. But also, let's evaluate our expenditures. Quinn says weekly, I would even say, look at your expenses daily, which by the way, you can get down to about one minute if you use, you know, like mint.com or you need a budget is the one I use. But a lot of these these web apps are so helpful because they can literally pull all the data from the various accounts, put it in one dashboard for you. And you can just kind of do a check in. And by the way, I found a, even just, I mean, it sounds so silly to say this, but like I found somebody charged me $300 for something that I didn't recognize last month. And I was like, oh, and I got the money back because it was, it was actually a mistake. So if I wasn't paying attention to that, I would have just paid it. Right. And let me tell you from personal experience, if you have children who are on the iPad, who are buying sneaky apps, you got to get a handle on that before it gets out of hand and they've bought like all the, you know, robots characters or whatever it is. So check the statements. Holarias, yeah, yeah, kids and the micro transactions, we need to evaluate this again, guys, what we're trying to help you do is really take the hardest part of the business, the financial management part, the business part of it out so that you can be as, you know, focus on what you do best, which is getting in front of clients helping clients buy and sell homes. So Quinn is, this is what she does. So talk about how do you help REALTORS better sort of plan for the future. Yeah, so I teach a five part system. It's the acronym is clear. So CLE, AR, commissions, lifestyle, expenses, allocation and return. Those are the five areas that we are looking at to figure out is everything, you know, at the level that it needs to be so that things are working together. So the C commissions piece, you know, that's obviously the money coming into your business. If you're, if you have a successful real estate agency, you have your lead gen, you have your sales, you have your money coming into the business. That's great because the other pieces are the parts that you can honestly control yourself, the commissions pieces of the piece that's most out of your control. So once you got that piece down on the rest of it is actually a lot easier to deal with. So the L is for lifestyle. So we talk about, you know, how are you spending your time, your money and your energy in your life, not just in your business, but with your family, with your health, with your community involvement, all of those types of things to understand, you know, are you doing the things that you want to be doing and how is your money helping you with that. The next piece is expenses as we've talked about. So looking at what you are spending your money on both in your business and we can look at your personal to if that is something that's helpful to you. But to get into those details and I am there to, you know, not shame you or tell you that you're doing everything wrong. I think a lot of people get worried about that. Like, this is, it's so bad. I just don't even want anybody to know, but, you know what, I've seen it all. Don't worry about it. We're going to get in there and we're going to look at what you're spending your money on and are those things that make sense. Are those things that you need to be running your business the best way you can. Allocations, we have already talked about a little bit having those targeted percentages is really helpful so that every dollar that comes in you have a, you know, a mental map of where everything is going and you know that you're always going to have what you need available in your savings and then return. So looking at the, the ways you're spending your time and money. And what is the return that you're getting on those. So if you are running the same ads that you ran three years ago that did great for you. And you haven't looked at it lately like, am I actually getting any leads from these ads. Maybe that's a place where hey, that's a big chunk of budget that can go into a different type of ads or just, you know, into a different type of lead gen strategy. So really looking holistically at what are all the things that are happening. And what are the tactical steps that you need to take that I'm happy to help you with like is it we need to be on a zoom call and we're going to walk through logging into the bank account and we're going to cancel all the subscriptions that we don't use anymore. You know, so I am there to be accountability coaching advice, sounding board, you can vent like all of the things, you know, it could be a little bit of a therapy session because money is a tough, tough area for a lot of people. Money is really associated with lots of shame too. And that's that's the big thing I want everyone to it's again, it's the idea of getting naked and stepping on a scale. It's not an easy thing for everybody to do and it's hard enough to do using that same metaphor in you know, by yourself in your own bathroom alone. But then to then say here is me to the entire to someone else like yourself and say here's all of my financial nakedness. It can be a little tough and then people feel you know a certain ways about their past spending activity. But guys, what I will tell you is get over that people when you hire a CPA to help you with this, they don't care, they just want to help you. And so even if you are if you have negative equity or if you have credit card debt or whatever the situation may be that you're like, I wish I didn't or I wish I was in a different position. And get past that because what we really need to do is we want you to be able to pay your bills and plan for the future and build a successful business. So many REALTORS leave the industry not because they don't have enough business because they don't manage their finances. It's like the silent killer that nobody talks about in this industry because we are all talking about deals deals deals get more and more deals. And there isn't any sort of you know like if you go to the NFL and you're your football player and you can focus exclusively on the you know playing on the field and lifting weights and you know doing all of this the skill building that you need to do to be a good professional athlete. They have people in the background making sure that when you retire you have a pension coming in well that doesn't really exist for real estate. So you have to take control of that. Unfortunately that we haven't figured out a way to automate that for people. So a Quinn and people like Quinn are available to help you figure that out because there's nothing worse than working for 30 years to realize, oh I didn't save as much as I could have. Or even better I didn't take advantage of as much of the deductions that I could have right my dad did his own taxes he was a CPA but that wasn't his profession. But he did it for like 15 years many a long long long time ago and then finally he started going to a CPA and turns out that he had been doing it wrong the whole time. And the CPA was like I cannot believe you are not in my dad was unintentional but he was like can't believe you're not in jail. Not because I mean actually the might add over paid his taxes funny enough for like 15 years and so the IRS had to give us a big check. Basically don't try to do everything yourself get a professional go to the value gal dot com to learn all things Quinn Driscoll. She is going to help you manage your finances guys just hire somebody for this don't try to do it yourself it's too much you have too much too too many other things on your plate at once as a REALTOR don't put this on your plate hire somebody trust me my my CPA shout out to Debbie the crazy tax lady that's her her moniker which is hilarious. And she is not crazy but that's what she calls herself and Debbie is my savior she tells me every year like for example Quinn I'll talk about this going back to the beginning about like starting an S corporation one day Debbie called me and said hey do you have monthly meetings for your board of directors which by the way I'm the only person on the board of directors for my silly little company. Yes I she says well you can expense those and I can have two parties a year I think as well like a holiday party so there's all these cool little ways where you can take advantage in a in an ethical way of the IRS tax codes by maximizing your deduction deductions and your expenses but you need to go to a professional for this tax you know just doing it online maybe it would give you some of that you know using but going to a highly respected and competent CPA and money manager will will be able to help you figure that out and also we need to we just say for retirement too. Yeah we sure do. Was a lot. I was I was I was I was saying a lot there and I apologize for that but I was just trying to say money is it's the thing we don't talk about and in this industry. When what what are the first steps so so so we talked about the first steps being when the when when when commission first of all establish yourself as a LLC we talked about that and talked to a CPA about why that makes sense we talked about creating an allocation strategy when commissions come in they're automatically distributed to channels that we don't touch retirement taxes etc. expenditures and then we also talked about return on investment right like how do we add that we can't do that. Actually evaluate our our business expenses that are generating income for us and somebody like you can come along and take a look at all of our books and say okay this is working for you in this isn't where do you see REALTORS struggling the most when they hire somebody like you. That is a great question so. So. Struggling them I think this the struggle is at the very beginning of just getting over the I haven't done everything right and I know I haven't and so I just feel like I'm going to be judged or I feel like you know there. A lot of people honestly will be like I don't want to feel like I'm getting in trouble in math class again because I'm not good with numbers you know so it's really those kind of deep seated emotional shame shame shame it is the shame so. So that's tricky but it's it's kind of like once you once you make the commitment I think making the commitment is the hardest thing that you are going to you're going to jump in you're going to do it it's going to be not perfect at the beginning it's going to take. You're going to try stuff and it's not going to work and then you're going to try something else and you're going to forget the other thing you were supposed to do and that's okay it's all part of the process so. You know just being okay with that as much as you can when you are like an overachiever you know like a lot of a lot of the top producers and high performing agents are it's hard to let those kind of vulnerabilities show a little bit. So I think that's honestly the hardest piece I've had so many top producers on our show talk about I I was my gross commission income was 500,000 or a million. So I was like $1.00 and I had no savings like people would say yes on paper it looks like I am incredibly successful because of all of these transactions and yet I really have nothing to show for the bank and that's where this guilt or shame comes in of like I don't really want people to peel back the curtain and see but the only way out of that it's funny I'm pretty confident in saying the only way to expel shame is by bringing it into the light meaning expose yourself. To somebody who can help guide you through so even if you feel crummy about your current financials and by the way little pro tip for everyone are a little truth bomb everybody feels crappy about their financial situation all the time nobody feels like I've got enough money I mean maybe one tenth of 1% of the population maybe feels that way for the rest of us everybody once more money everybody wants to save more spend less we all feel like I should. Do better right so you're total totally normal to feel like I should be spending less and saving more and I should be earning more right like that's totally totally normal so don't worry find somebody like Quinn so quit the best way that our audience can can. And by the way pick a CPA that has experience dealing with REALTORS because they understand Quinn for example understands the REALTOR money sort of circle she understands that process pick somebody who gets working with small independent businesses like yourself like like REALTORS but please for everything to learn about Quinn and what she offers go to the value of the market.
