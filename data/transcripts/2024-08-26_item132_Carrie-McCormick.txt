[00:02:37] Welcome to keeping it real.
[00:02:39] The largest podcast for real estate agents and by real estate agents.
[00:02:42] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:02:43] I'm your guide and host through the show today.
[00:02:46] Once again, is our monthly series called the Monday Market Minute with Carrie McCormick from the Carrie McCormick real estate group with at properties here in Chicago.
[00:02:54] By the way, at properties Christie's International at Carrie is a top 1% producer in Chicago with over 20 years of experience helping buyers, sellers and investors in the past 12 months out of 46,000 real estate agents in the Chicago and area.
[00:03:08] Carrie is always in the top 10 or 15 agents again out of 46,000.
[00:03:13] She does it all by herself.
[00:03:14] That's the truth.
[00:03:15] It's incredible true superstar and an expert in everything from first time home buyers, veteran investors and luxury properties.
[00:03:22] She also works with a lot of developers who are chose who choose Carrie often to represent their high end developments.
[00:03:29] Please check her out on Instagram and she also does all of her own Instagram, which is even more impressive once you start seeing her posts,
[00:03:37] which is which is at Carrie McCormick real estate.
[00:03:40] We'll have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:03:41] Also, if you want to connect with Carrie, Carrie McCormick are E.com is a place where you can connect with her.
[00:03:46] Maybe you have a people somebody who's moving to Chicago and you don't work in, you don't work in Chicago or maybe you're a place where people from Chicago move to and you want to see if Carrie
[00:03:56] might become a good referral source.
[00:03:57] So great way to connect with her there.
[00:03:59] Carrie, welcome once again to the show.
[00:04:01] Thank you so much.
[00:04:02] Always appreciate that intro.
[00:04:04] Well, it's super appreciated by our fans because you are help.
[00:04:09] I would ask how many listings you have, but it might it might just overwhelm you because there's that many that you are always in the middle of dozens and dozens of deals in any given moment.
[00:04:19] I don't know how you do it.
[00:04:20] And we have the NAR settlement that today is actually recording on the 19th.
[00:04:25] This will probably come out a week from now.
[00:04:27] So it's brand news is like day two.
[00:04:29] It went live on Saturday.
[00:04:31] And you know, probably everyone's a little sick of hearing about NAR.
[00:04:34] But what I would love to know is has anything changed yet for you or is it still have you where there changes you made in the past that made this transition more smooth.
[00:04:46] Yes.
[00:04:46] So again, it's day two and you know, to me, it's business as usual on day two so far.
[00:04:52] But you know, doing a lot of prepping and reading and what do I need to do to obviously adapt and pivot to this and I love that I've been in the industry for over 20 years.
[00:05:03] So I've been through a lot of different shifts in our industry, but this is the biggest one.
[00:05:09] And obviously it affects buyers primarily.
[00:05:13] So I think just thinking through, you know, a few steps ahead in having your and again, I know this is maybe redundant.
[00:05:21] But I do think it's all of us shift to buyer presentations just as we've gone.
[00:05:28] Listing presentations.
[00:05:29] We are now going to be buyer presentation.
[00:05:32] So I also think it's important that you strengthen your personal brand.
[00:05:37] Because buyers are going to want to work with someone that they trust that they feel comfortable with.
[00:05:42] And they're going to be able to do that for tease.
[00:05:45] So now you have to think of yourself as branding as a buyer's broker, right?
[00:05:50] Because again, we did a lot of branding and a lot of marketing as a listing broker.
[00:05:54] But be ready to strengthen your personal brand and you can do that through content marketing, social media,
[00:06:01] doing local events to position yourself as a leader in your market.
[00:06:05] And again, I think that's going to, you know, draw people towards you as an expertise.
[00:06:11] Also using client testimonials.
[00:06:13] That is something that we've always done.
[00:06:16] And I'd always encourage you to do that.
[00:06:19] And again, a lot of the testimonials have been, you know, kind of vague in our services.
[00:06:24] But really ask your clients to take a, you know, a deeper response in the client testimonial.
[00:06:30] Because that will boost your reputation.
[00:06:32] And when they see just like anyone goes to Yelp or they go to a restaurant review,
[00:06:37] they want to read and hear what people are saying.
[00:06:39] So pay attention to your testimonials.
[00:06:44] The other thing that I've been doing over the last couple of days is collaborating with my peers, right?
[00:06:49] And we did some role playing.
[00:06:51] I talked to agents from all different markets through Christie's and just going through different scenarios.
[00:06:58] You know, because we know in our industry it's really not black and white.
[00:07:01] And there's so many different personalities and different, just different people, you know, that we have to deal with.
[00:07:08] So going through different scenarios has been extremely helpful.
[00:07:12] No one likes to role play in our business, but or in any business, I should say,
[00:07:17] but I do think it's important to go through them and, you know, talk with your peers as well.
[00:07:23] The other thing I've been working on too is adding value add services, right?
[00:07:29] So since our commissions are coming under scrutiny, and we have to tell buyers, why do you need us?
[00:07:34] Why, you know, why do we deserve our X percent, right?
[00:07:39] So going through and making up your new buyer packets, doing your added value,
[00:07:46] just so that you can justify and put a detailed analysis of why you deserve that commission rate and educating them on the process.
[00:07:55] One person that told me I thought this was a brilliant example is, as we know as brokers in the in the background,
[00:08:01] there's so much that happens from paperwork to, you know, the inspection reports going through those,
[00:08:07] put a packet together of what a buy side transaction looks like and all the paperwork that goes goes on on our background, right?
[00:08:16] Because they typically don't see or they don't see it as a whole package, you know, a buyer goes through it one by one.
[00:08:22] But in your buyer presentation or listing presentation, show them.
[00:08:27] Here's a sample report that we're going to get from the inspector.
[00:08:31] My job is to go through this report with you and identify the items and, you know, the buyers across from you is going to be like,
[00:08:37] oh, my God, I didn't realize that inspection report, you know, is going through all this and reassure them that yes, this home, you know,
[00:08:45] in this particular inspection report, there was a foundation issue, there was a window issue, there was a roof issue.
[00:08:51] But, you know, because of my experience, I have trusted partners that I'm going to get you a trusted roofer.
[00:08:57] I'm going to get you a trusted foundation person.
[00:09:02] Let's have them come out with one phone call.
[00:09:04] I can have someone out to the house for you, you know, having, and again, explaining to buyers that you have the toolkit,
[00:09:12] you've got everybody there to help them through the process.
[00:09:15] This attorney is closing companies, all of, you know, all of that stuff.
[00:09:18] So I do think, you know, I've been putting mine together.
[00:09:23] I know it's today is August 19th, but I'm trying to refine it.
[00:09:26] But I think that's going to be important to set yourself apart from others.
[00:09:31] So from a marketing standpoint, I think it's going to be a game changer for a lot of us.
[00:09:36] Yeah, practice your pitches, what I'm hearing a lot of.
[00:09:39] And also realizing to that there are going to be new commission models that agents will adopt.
[00:09:47] And so you might be in a listing presentation and not realize that somebody came before you and offered a flat fee as opposed to a percentage.
[00:09:56] And that seller might say, well, I met with someone else and they were only going to charge me X as a flat fee.
[00:10:02] Why do you do percentage?
[00:10:03] And I think it's will be who the agent to practice answering those questions or vice versa.
[00:10:09] If you're a flat fee person, here's why I do that versus, you know, charging a percentage, whatever your preferred model is.
[00:10:17] And there's other models you could do, but really understanding that people are going to be offering different packages to clients.
[00:10:26] And being able to explain, here's why I do the one.
[00:10:28] And I love your idea about, about role playing with, with other agents and you're right.
[00:10:34] None of us like role playing, but it's probably one of the most
[00:10:38] helpful ways to build skill, I think.
[00:10:40] And yeah, so I love that.
[00:10:43] And I love that 20 years in, you're still chatting with, with people in the industry going, hey, what are you doing for this?
[00:10:49] And so yeah, it's just, oh, here's another suggestion.
[00:10:52] If you're doing open houses, bring some no agency forms with you because you're going to need them when people walk in on represented.
[00:10:58] And that's that's a brand new thing.
[00:11:01] Well, it's probably something agents should have done for a long time, but it's now now, obviously a must.
[00:11:07] So if you're not familiar with no agency, and again, this maybe I don't know if it changes from Illinois to other states, but I don't think it does.
[00:11:14] But if it does ask your managing broker, learn about no agency as an option for open houses.
[00:11:20] It's super important.
[00:11:21] Yeah.
[00:11:22] Yeah, it has, has D so, you know, obviously, you know, nobody can predict what this will do to commissions, but I think at the very least it'll help the agents who take this very seriously to be able to really hone in their pitch to say, here's why I'm charging X.
[00:11:39] Here's what I get paid for here are the list of services I provide.
[00:11:44] And buyers, you know, are going to have to get familiar with and sort of, I think agents really have to have that conversation about here's how it used to be done.
[00:11:55] Here's where fees were kind of not as visible.
[00:11:59] And now we're just bringing them into the into the light a little bit more.
[00:12:02] And I think having that having that pitches is awesome.
[00:12:09] So what, you know, I wanted to ask you about this.
[00:12:12] So last week we saw rates come down a little bit and it seemed to spark.
[00:12:16] I talked to some friends of mine who are lenders and they were like, oh my God, we are now getting tons of applications.
[00:12:22] So I'm curious what you think about that only because I don't think inventory has changed that much, at least here in Chicago and probably a lot of places.
[00:12:31] So it doesn't look like the inventory is there to meet a lot of demand.
[00:12:34] So I'm curious on, have you, if you've noticed anything like that or am I wrong and we're starting to see more inventory.
[00:12:40] No, you're right.
[00:12:42] So we are still seeing low inventory at least here in Chicago.
[00:12:47] Not a lot has come on the market.
[00:12:49] We are thinking though after Labor Day, you know, we still are seeing people vacationing, getting their kids back to school, etc.
[00:12:57] So after Labor Day, I am predicting that we're going to have some more inventory in our market and this is perfect timing for these interest rates to come down.
[00:13:06] You know, any little movement in them is just is sparking some more client movement.
[00:13:13] So happy to see it.
[00:13:15] You know, all of this is coming together at one point with this NAR with interest down, hopefully more inventory coming in the market.
[00:13:22] The election.
[00:13:23] The election, you know, again, this is this is our world we live in and we are professionals in our industry.
[00:13:31] It's our job to navigate it and navigate it for the best of our clients.
[00:13:34] So we'll be fine.
[00:13:36] We just need to work through change and everyone knows if you adapt to the change, you're going to win.
[00:13:40] If you want to refuse it and study it, you're not going to.
[00:13:46] One of my favorite expressions, it's a tough one.
[00:13:49] It's kind of basically the serenity prayer, but but a little bit shorter way to say it is resistance to change resistance to reality doesn't change reality.
[00:13:59] So like we can fight against what is, but it is what it is.
[00:14:05] So I think that's important is that there are always opportunities and solutions forward.
[00:14:11] And there's 1.5 million jobs that are affected by this.
[00:14:17] So people there's a big enough industry.
[00:14:19] It's one of the biggest in the country.
[00:14:20] So it will be figured out.
[00:14:23] So have faith and realize too, I think that a lot of lesser involved agents will probably fall away because they won't be able to do all of these services.
[00:14:34] They won't be able to explain their value as well.
[00:14:37] And as a result, they'll probably just find it's not as easy to do a couple of deals a year as it used to be.
[00:14:44] And I think brokerages are going to start being less agreeable to those smaller agents as well.
[00:14:51] Because I, and this is just a thought I know in our brokerage, we're talking about it because what we're realizing now is these smaller part-time agents or dual career agents.
[00:15:01] There's nothing wrong with being a dual career agent, of course.
[00:15:04] But it's certainly harder to keep abreast of all of the compliance and they become a higher liability.
[00:15:11] So I think there's going to be brokerages that will start really wanting single career agents exclusively or certainly favor that.
[00:15:20] So if you're a single career agent, this is great news because there's going to be less players in the space.
[00:15:24] And people who have maybe their brother-in-law who has another full-time job but does this on the side, those kind of people maybe will fall away.
[00:15:35] And you can help pick up some of that market share.
[00:15:37] Yeah.
[00:15:38] I think you're right on.
[00:15:41] So I do think my last comment is going to be just strengthen your current client relationships too.
[00:15:46] You are the expert.
[00:15:48] So whether you communicate them through email, through a phone call, through a written letter, just kind of explaining what's going on, I do think your current clients and past clients want to hear from you.
[00:16:00] Absolutely.
[00:16:01] And if nothing else just to sort of let them know that your business is usual and that you're there for them and there to explain things to them and deepen those.
[00:16:11] I think it's really a great opportunity to deepen relationships.
[00:16:14] We know that relationships are everything.
[00:16:15] So I think that's a perfect place. We'll keep this one short and sweet.
[00:16:19] Let's let's let's let Kerry get back to her dozens and dozens of listings and all of the buyers.
[00:16:24] She is also working with speaking of if there are said this to be any but just as a reminder, if there are agents out there and other markets who go, I have people that move to Chicago.
[00:16:35] And I don't work in Chicago.
[00:16:37] Kerry would love opportunity to see if she'd be a good fit as a referral partner.
[00:16:40] Say and vice versa.
[00:16:41] If you're somebody who people from Chicago move to or maybe retire to consider Kerry as a someone to reach out and see if you can develop a partnership and Kerry even can go so goes so far.
[00:16:53] Sometimes is to go and meet the some of her referral partners out in the in the United States.
[00:16:57] So she takes it very seriously.
[00:16:59] So if you think you'd be a good partner to her and with her, please reach out to her.
[00:17:03] And also please follow her on Instagram.
[00:17:05] Again, she does this all herself and I'm just I'm still shocked.
[00:17:09] Five or six years into doing this podcast with Kerry that she still does this all herself.
[00:17:13] It is beyond impressive.
[00:17:15] And if you're looking for a good template for what to do in social media, specifically on Instagram.
[00:17:20] Kerry is a really great.
[00:17:23] She's kind of in one of the top people least here in Chicago.
[00:17:26] And I haven't seen too many others outside of Chicago that that you know have more impressive feeds than her.
[00:17:31] So check it out at Kerry McCormick real estate is where you can check out what she's doing on social.
[00:17:35] And yeah, Kerry, if anyone ever wants to reach out to you, what's the best way for them to get in touch?
[00:17:42] Of course, always call me three one two nine six one four six one two.
[00:17:48] Okay, everyone.
[00:17:48] Well, I hope everyone post settlement is doing okay.
[00:17:51] We're breathing.
[00:17:52] It's all going to work out because it has to because there's too much at stake and it will.
[00:17:58] And just have faith that you know people will come up with solutions.
[00:18:01] Maybe that don't even exist yet today.
[00:18:04] To help, for example, people are very worried about buyer buyers being able to afford commissions.
[00:18:09] If they need to pay out of pocket.
[00:18:12] Breathe realize that there may be solutions coming, but for right now, you know, learn how to make how to have that conversation.
[00:18:18] And you'll be fine.
[00:18:20] And all right, well, we will see everybody on the next episode on behalf of the audience.
[00:18:24] Thank you, Kerry.
[00:18:25] Once again, being such a great supporter of our show, we adore Kerry and on behalf of Kerry on ourselves.
[00:18:30] We, of course, also adore our audience.
[00:18:32] Thank you for continuing to make the show bigger and bigger.
[00:18:34] We had our best month ever, which was in July and August.
[00:18:37] We're probably on pace to we're on pace right now to exceed that as well.
[00:18:41] So we are so grateful.
[00:18:42] Thank you.
[00:18:42] Please tell a friend about the show.

Maybe you have a people somebody who's moving to Chicago and you don't work in, you don't work in Chicago or maybe you're a place where people from Chicago move to and you want to see if Carrie might become a good referral source. So great way to connect with her there. Carrie, welcome once again to the show. Thank you so much. Always appreciate that intro. Well, it's super appreciated by our fans because you are help. I would ask how many listings you have, but it might it might just overwhelm you because there's that many that you are always in the middle of dozens and dozens of deals in any given moment. I don't know how you do it. And we have the NAR settlement that today is actually recording on the 19th. This will probably come out a week from now. So it's brand news is like day two. It went live on Saturday. And you know, probably everyone's a little sick of hearing about NAR. But what I would love to know is has anything changed yet for you or is it still have you where there changes you made in the past that made this transition more smooth. Yes. So again, it's day two and you know, to me, it's business as usual on day two so far. But you know, doing a lot of prepping and reading and what do I need to do to obviously adapt and pivot to this and I love that I've been in the industry for over 20 years. So I've been through a lot of different shifts in our industry, but this is the biggest one. And obviously it affects buyers primarily. So I think just thinking through, you know, a few steps ahead in having your and again, I know this is maybe redundant. But I do think it's all of us shift to buyer presentations just as we've gone. Listing presentations. We are now going to be buyer presentation. So I also think it's important that you strengthen your personal brand. Because buyers are going to want to work with someone that they trust that they feel comfortable with. And they're going to be able to do that for tease. So now you have to think of yourself as branding as a buyer's broker, right? Because again, we did a lot of branding and a lot of marketing as a listing broker. But be ready to strengthen your personal brand and you can do that through content marketing, social media, doing local events to position yourself as a leader in your market. And again, I think that's going to, you know, draw people towards you as an expertise. Also using client testimonials. That is something that we've always done. And I'd always encourage you to do that. And again, a lot of the testimonials have been, you know, kind of vague in our services. But really ask your clients to take a, you know, a deeper response in the client testimonial. Because that will boost your reputation. And when they see just like anyone goes to Yelp or they go to a restaurant review, they want to read and hear what people are saying. So pay attention to your testimonials. The other thing that I've been doing over the last couple of days is collaborating with my peers, right? And we did some role playing. I talked to agents from all different markets through Christie's and just going through different scenarios. You know, because we know in our industry it's really not black and white. And there's so many different personalities and different, just different people, you know, that we have to deal with. So going through different scenarios has been extremely helpful. No one likes to role play in our business, but or in any business, I should say, but I do think it's important to go through them and, you know, talk with your peers as well. The other thing I've been working on too is adding value add services, right? So since our commissions are coming under scrutiny, and we have to tell buyers, why do you need us? Why, you know, why do we deserve our X percent, right? So going through and making up your new buyer packets, doing your added value, just so that you can justify and put a detailed analysis of why you deserve that commission rate and educating them on the process. One person that told me I thought this was a brilliant example is, as we know as brokers in the in the background, there's so much that happens from paperwork to, you know, the inspection reports going through those, put a packet together of what a buy side transaction looks like and all the paperwork that goes goes on on our background, right? Because they typically don't see or they don't see it as a whole package, you know, a buyer goes through it one by one. But in your buyer presentation or listing presentation, show them. Here's a sample report that we're going to get from the inspector. My job is to go through this report with you and identify the items and, you know, the buyers across from you is going to be like, oh, my God, I didn't realize that inspection report, you know, is going through all this and reassure them that yes, this home, you know, in this particular inspection report, there was a foundation issue, there was a window issue, there was a roof issue. But, you know, because of my experience, I have trusted partners that I'm going to get you a trusted roofer. I'm going to get you a trusted foundation person. Let's have them come out with one phone call. I can have someone out to the house for you, you know, having, and again, explaining to buyers that you have the toolkit, you've got everybody there to help them through the process. This attorney is closing companies, all of, you know, all of that stuff. So I do think, you know, I've been putting mine together. I know it's today is August 19th, but I'm trying to refine it. But I think that's going to be important to set yourself apart from others. So from a marketing standpoint, I think it's going to be a game changer for a lot of us. Yeah, practice your pitches, what I'm hearing a lot of. And also realizing to that there are going to be new commission models that agents will adopt. And so you might be in a listing presentation and not realize that somebody came before you and offered a flat fee as opposed to a percentage. And that seller might say, well, I met with someone else and they were only going to charge me X as a flat fee. Why do you do percentage? And I think it's will be who the agent to practice answering those questions or vice versa. If you're a flat fee person, here's why I do that versus, you know, charging a percentage, whatever your preferred model is. And there's other models you could do, but really understanding that people are going to be offering different packages to clients. And being able to explain, here's why I do the one. And I love your idea about, about role playing with, with other agents and you're right. None of us like role playing, but it's probably one of the most helpful ways to build skill, I think. And yeah, so I love that. And I love that 20 years in, you're still chatting with, with people in the industry going, hey, what are you doing for this? And so yeah, it's just, oh, here's another suggestion. If you're doing open houses, bring some no agency forms with you because you're going to need them when people walk in on represented. And that's that's a brand new thing. Well, it's probably something agents should have done for a long time, but it's now now, obviously a must. So if you're not familiar with no agency, and again, this maybe I don't know if it changes from Illinois to other states, but I don't think it does. But if it does ask your managing broker, learn about no agency as an option for open houses. It's super important. Yeah. Yeah, it has, has D so, you know, obviously, you know, nobody can predict what this will do to commissions, but I think at the very least it'll help the agents who take this very seriously to be able to really hone in their pitch to say, here's why I'm charging X. Here's what I get paid for here are the list of services I provide. And buyers, you know, are going to have to get familiar with and sort of, I think agents really have to have that conversation about here's how it used to be done. Here's where fees were kind of not as visible. And now we're just bringing them into the into the light a little bit more. And I think having that having that pitches is awesome. So what, you know, I wanted to ask you about this. So last week we saw rates come down a little bit and it seemed to spark. I talked to some friends of mine who are lenders and they were like, oh my God, we are now getting tons of applications. So I'm curious what you think about that only because I don't think inventory has changed that much, at least here in Chicago and probably a lot of places. So it doesn't look like the inventory is there to meet a lot of demand. So I'm curious on, have you, if you've noticed anything like that or am I wrong and we're starting to see more inventory. No, you're right. So we are still seeing low inventory at least here in Chicago. Not a lot has come on the market. We are thinking though after Labor Day, you know, we still are seeing people vacationing, getting their kids back to school, etc. So after Labor Day, I am predicting that we're going to have some more inventory in our market and this is perfect timing for these interest rates to come down. You know, any little movement in them is just is sparking some more client movement. So happy to see it. You know, all of this is coming together at one point with this NAR with interest down, hopefully more inventory coming in the market. The election. The election, you know, again, this is this is our world we live in and we are professionals in our industry. It's our job to navigate it and navigate it for the best of our clients. So we'll be fine. We just need to work through change and everyone knows if you adapt to the change, you're going to win. If you want to refuse it and study it, you're not going to. One of my favorite expressions, it's a tough one. It's kind of basically the serenity prayer, but but a little bit shorter way to say it is resistance to change resistance to reality doesn't change reality. So like we can fight against what is, but it is what it is. So I think that's important is that there are always opportunities and solutions forward. And there's 1.5 million jobs that are affected by this. So people there's a big enough industry. It's one of the biggest in the country. So it will be figured out. So have faith and realize too, I think that a lot of lesser involved agents will probably fall away because they won't be able to do all of these services. They won't be able to explain their value as well. And as a result, they'll probably just find it's not as easy to do a couple of deals a year as it used to be. And I think brokerages are going to start being less agreeable to those smaller agents as well. Because I, and this is just a thought I know in our brokerage, we're talking about it because what we're realizing now is these smaller part-time agents or dual career agents. There's nothing wrong with being a dual career agent, of course. But it's certainly harder to keep abreast of all of the compliance and they become a higher liability. So I think there's going to be brokerages that will start really wanting single career agents exclusively or certainly favor that. So if you're a single career agent, this is great news because there's going to be less players in the space. And people who have maybe their brother-in-law who has another full-time job but does this on the side, those kind of people maybe will fall away. And you can help pick up some of that market share. Yeah. I think you're right on. So I do think my last comment is going to be just strengthen your current client relationships too. You are the expert. So whether you communicate them through email, through a phone call, through a written letter, just kind of explaining what's going on, I do think your current clients and past clients want to hear from you. Absolutely. And if nothing else just to sort of let them know that your business is usual and that you're there for them and there to explain things to them and deepen those. I think it's really a great opportunity to deepen relationships. We know that relationships are everything. So I think that's a perfect place. We'll keep this one short and sweet. Let's let's let's let Kerry get back to her dozens and dozens of listings and all of the buyers. She is also working with speaking of if there are said this to be any but just as a reminder, if there are agents out there and other markets who go, I have people that move to Chicago. And I don't work in Chicago. Kerry would love opportunity to see if she'd be a good fit as a referral partner. Say and vice versa. If you're somebody who people from Chicago move to or maybe retire to consider Kerry as a someone to reach out and see if you can develop a partnership and Kerry even can go so goes so far. Sometimes is to go and meet the some of her referral partners out in the in the United States. So she takes it very seriously. So if you think you'd be a good partner to her and with her, please reach out to her. And also please follow her on Instagram. Again, she does this all herself and I'm just I'm still shocked. Five or six years into doing this podcast with Kerry that she still does this all herself. It is beyond impressive. And if you're looking for a good template for what to do in social media, specifically on Instagram. Kerry is a really great. She's kind of in one of the top people least here in Chicago. And I haven't seen too many others outside of Chicago that that you know have more impressive feeds than her. So check it out at Kerry McCormick real estate is where you can check out what she's doing on social. And yeah, Kerry, if anyone ever wants to reach out to you, what's the best way for them to get in touch? Of course, always call me three one two nine six one four six one two. Okay, everyone. Well, I hope everyone post settlement is doing okay. We're breathing. It's all going to work out because it has to because there's too much at stake and it will. And just have faith that you know people will come up with solutions. Maybe that don't even exist yet today. To help, for example, people are very worried about buyer buyers being able to afford commissions. If they need to pay out of pocket. Breathe realize that there may be solutions coming, but for right now, you know, learn how to make how to have that conversation. And you'll be fine. And all right, well, we will see everybody on the next episode on behalf of the audience. Thank you, Kerry. Once again, being such a great supporter of our show, we adore Kerry and on behalf of Kerry on ourselves. We, of course, also adore our audience.
