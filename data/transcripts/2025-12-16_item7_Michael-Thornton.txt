============================================================

[00:00:00] Today we're talking to somebody that left a high paying job in the corporate world to

[00:01:22] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:25] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team?
[00:01:29] Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:33] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:36] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:38] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:42] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:47] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:53] to leave you?
[00:01:54] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents.
[00:01:59] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:03] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:08] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:12] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:17] read everything I offer.
[00:02:18] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agents
[00:02:24] needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:26] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:28] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:32] Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:38] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:41] That's corded.io.
[00:02:43] And now onto the show.
[00:02:58] Hello and welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and
[00:03:03] four real estate agents.
[00:03:04] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:05] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:07] And just a moment, we're going to be speaking top producer Mike Thornton.
[00:03:11] Before we get to Mike, as if you are new here, welcome.
[00:03:13] If you are new, actually if you are returning, welcome back.
[00:03:17] We appreciate you and please, as always, the best way you can help us grow.
[00:03:21] Tell a friend about this podcast.
[00:03:22] What we do here is interview the top agents in the country and say, how'd you do that?
[00:03:26] And then we pass those over to you so you can learn and do what they have doing and are
[00:03:31] still doing today to grow their business so you can be just like them.
[00:03:35] I have a thing I built for everyone.
[00:03:37] So before we get to the interview, I want to tell you about it.
[00:03:40] I want you to use it.
[00:03:40] Use it as much as you can.
[00:03:42] Tell everybody about it.
[00:03:43] It's totally free.
[00:03:44] And I want your feedback.
[00:03:45] So I created a listing rewriter.
[00:03:48] And what I did is this was based on a problem I saw where agents would be using AI to rewrite
[00:03:53] their listing descriptions, but they didn't really get success with it.
[00:03:57] In fact, everybody was kind of doing it the same way.
[00:03:59] So all the listing descriptions in someone's area, you could tell if they were AI or not.
[00:04:04] And they just, if everyone looks the same, it's not that great.
[00:04:06] And they just also weren't that great.
[00:04:08] So what we, what I did is I have it now running through a six stage approach where it's
[00:04:13] literally rewriting it six different times from six different experts, ones like a fiction,
[00:04:18] best telling author, ones a journalist, ones that edited a newspaper, people like that
[00:04:22] who can really know how to write good copy.
[00:04:25] And it's going to give you three different variations of your existing listing description.
[00:04:29] So here's what you do.
[00:04:30] You go to listing.joincal.com listing.joincal.com.
[00:04:35] And you put in a listing description.
[00:04:37] You give me your address because I'm going to email it to you.
[00:04:39] And then you put in just a little info about the property because what we're going to do,
[00:04:43] not just rewrite your listing description, we're going to take a look at the surrounding areas.
[00:04:48] And we're going to see, did you miss anything?
[00:04:50] Are there parks or their, you know, schools?
[00:04:52] Are there features in the neighborhood or the community that are close to this property
[00:04:55] that you need to be talking about?
[00:04:57] Or we're also going to look to see it past listings for this address.
[00:05:00] Did you miss something?
[00:05:01] Is there something in a past listing that you're not featuring in your listing description
[00:05:05] or in your listing itself?
[00:05:07] So we're going to find that.
[00:05:08] We're going to add that for you.
[00:05:08] I'm telling you I've got nothing but amazing feedback on this.
[00:05:12] All I did was rewrite you a really good AI query.
[00:05:15] It's totally free, like I said.
[00:05:16] It's my gift to you.
[00:05:17] I want you to try it listing.joincal.com.
[00:05:20] Let me know if it works better for you.
[00:05:22] I used it myself, sold my condo in two days in November.
[00:05:25] And for the highest amount ever for a condo of my tier in my building, maybe that's just coincidence.
[00:05:30] I don't know, but it certainly didn't hurt to have an amazing listing description.
[00:05:34] So check it out listing.joincal.com.
[00:05:36] Give me your feedback and I'll keep building these tools for you because I like it.
[00:05:39] It's fun.
[00:05:40] And I'm really digging the whole vibe coding thing.
[00:05:42] So I'm working on my next tool.
[00:05:43] By the way, I'll tell you, give you a sneak preview.
[00:05:45] It's called Why is My Listing Not Selling?
[00:05:47] So it's kind of a similar idea where you're going to basically paste in your listing.
[00:05:53] You're listing.
[00:05:54] I'm trying to figure out how to do this.
[00:05:55] That's a little bit tricky actually.
[00:05:57] We can't scrape Zillow, which would be great if we could, but they don't let you do that.
[00:06:00] So I have to figure out how you can get your listing over to us.
[00:06:02] But once you do that, we're going to have it go about 20 different data points and figure out what are some reasons.
[00:06:09] Is including things like are your photos no good?
[00:06:11] Like it's even going to look at that, but it's going to look at other data driven things like, you know,
[00:06:15] comps and inventory and the current rates for borrowers and just lots of different different
[00:06:22] different data points so that we can figure out why is your home not selling so that you don't lose the listing.
[00:06:26] And you can give this to your client and say, Hey, here's why the home is not selling.
[00:06:29] So I'm working on that.
[00:06:30] That'll also be free at least at first and maybe I'll charge it on the road, but who knows.
[00:06:34] So I'm really excited about that one too, but check out listing.
[00:06:37] Join kale.com.
[00:06:38] Give it a try.
[00:06:39] Tell me if you like it and please use it.
[00:06:41] Tell your friends.
[00:06:42] All right.
[00:06:42] On my interview with Mike Thornton.
[00:06:44] Thanks.
[00:06:59] Best advice you've received in real estate.
[00:07:03] Best advice.
[00:07:04] I'd say it comes from my father.
[00:07:06] He is a REALTOR of about 50 years.
[00:07:09] And so he would come home after work and he'd say, Michael, in this business,
[00:07:13] you can't get too high and you can't get too low.
[00:07:16] And I was like, at the time, I didn't really understand what he was talking about,
[00:07:20] but I think it was either a day where he cashed a big check or a day where he lost a big check.
[00:07:24] And he would say, you know, you can't get too high or you too low.
[00:07:27] And I think that that resonated with me when I got into this business because, you know,
[00:07:31] I transitioned from a very steady job into this and the first year getting over the hill was very difficult.
[00:07:36] And three out of my first six deals fell through.
[00:07:39] And I was very much questioning whether I should be in this industry or not.
[00:07:43] And I drew back on that advice and I think it's true.
[00:07:46] And I think it also kind of speaks to, you know, you don't want the transaction to be about you.
[00:07:51] The clients need to feel like it's about them because it is.
[00:07:54] And if you have this grip on the transaction that's unhealthy, I think everybody can sense that
[00:07:58] and successful REALTOR don't have that.
[00:08:02] I think that's really wise advice.
[00:08:04] And I also love the idea of the not getting too high or too low because if you celebrate too much of a victory,
[00:08:12] the opposite is going to happen as well.
[00:08:14] You have to, you know, almost, you know, when those challenging moments happen,
[00:08:18] you're going to feel those much more deeply than, you know, so it's almost better to,
[00:08:23] I think, maintain a slightly stoic response, not to not celebrate when things are good,
[00:08:29] but to realize that everything's fluid.
[00:08:32] Everything moves.
[00:08:33] There's always challenge.
[00:08:35] There's always good things that happen.
[00:08:36] And they just kind of move it and out and never to be too moved.
[00:08:40] Like kind of thinking of it as like a mountain.
[00:08:42] Like there's storms that come.
[00:08:44] There's, there's, you know, bright sunny days.
[00:08:47] The mountain doesn't move.
[00:08:48] The mountain just absorbs it all.
[00:08:50] So, yeah, I mean, we're talking, you know, in December, and I think it's,
[00:08:54] it gets highlighted this time of year because for me, the way my brain works is,
[00:08:58] I'm starting at zero.
[00:08:59] I'm starting at zero right now because I'm booking business for next year.
[00:09:02] And just the way I operate, I want to grow each year and provide a better product each year.
[00:09:06] And so the last transaction really doesn't mean anything.
[00:09:09] It means hopefully you deliver a great experience, but as far as it can't carry you into
[00:09:15] your next paycheck necessarily.
[00:09:17] So I think this business is unique.
[00:09:18] It's not like if we are financial advisors, we have a book of business and we maintain it.
[00:09:22] We have to go find our next meal if we want to eat in Peter family.
[00:09:26] Yeah.
[00:09:27] If somebody could ever figure out how to, you know, charge like a financial advisor,
[00:09:32] where it's, you know, percentage of assets under management, where you're getting one
[00:09:36] percent a year.
[00:09:37] They do.
[00:09:38] Boy, they are not starting over from zero every year, but REALTORS are.
[00:09:42] So you're right.
[00:09:42] So you can't really celebrate because you got to eat, you got to eat next.
[00:09:46] And all right.
[00:09:48] So wonderful advice there.
[00:09:49] Worst advice you've received.
[00:09:52] So I think this was well meaning advice.
[00:09:56] It was not to, the advice was not to lead my corporate American job to do real estate.
[00:10:00] And I think it, I think it meant well.
[00:10:03] I think the perception was I was leaving something very steady to go to something that's not steady.
[00:10:08] And that's true to begin with.
[00:10:10] However, that wasn't true for my personality and what I was looking to do.
[00:10:15] I wasn't fired up going into that job that I was holding where I wasn't building anything.
[00:10:20] I was looking around and I was seeing people that were necessarily happy.
[00:10:23] I didn't have autonomy, had a cap ceiling.
[00:10:26] And I've seen so many restructuring that I wouldn't consider that safe at all.
[00:10:31] I consider what I'm doing now much safer where I have control to a certain extent over my success.
[00:10:36] I mean, you know, there's different factors, but I can decide where I take this and I have nobody else to blame if it doesn't work out.
[00:10:42] And so for me, that was less risky because I was betting on myself.
[00:10:47] And so I think the advice was, you know, it was might, might make sense to some, but for me, it wasn't what I needed to hear.
[00:10:53] I needed to hear, hey, you got this, you're going to, you're going to make this work.
[00:10:58] You love people, you're smart.
[00:10:59] You're going to carry those previous experiences into real estate and do something really special.
[00:11:04] And that's what I did believe in my wife and I had those conversations when we made that transition.
[00:11:07] And she's like, I trust you. I know you can do this.
[00:11:09] And I think that's what helped me kind of catapult and get past that first year because anybody that starts in this business,
[00:11:15] so that first year is just treacherous.
[00:11:17] Oh, sure. Yeah, it's, it's, you know, you're giving up benefits.
[00:11:20] You're giving up some sort of, well, you're right.
[00:11:23] You're really not giving up any sort of guarantee because of course, you know, companies go out of business,
[00:11:27] companies restructure, people get, I was laid off from a company just before I started this job,
[00:11:33] where I was, had received a perfect review, which I probably shouldn't have received a perfect repub,
[00:11:39] should have got like a 99 out of 100, but I literally got 100 review.
[00:11:44] And, and I got it like $15,000 raised.
[00:11:46] And then literally the next week, they're like, oh, yeah, we're eliminating your position.
[00:11:49] I was like, what?
[00:11:50] So, so the idea of not celebrating too much also was a great, great advice because I was like,
[00:11:56] yeah, it's not making more money.
[00:11:57] And then I was like, all of a sudden out of a job.
[00:11:59] So I certainly understand that.
[00:12:01] And also, you know, you are now running your own business.
[00:12:04] And I think that is a really great, great advice is you are walking away from some level of certainty,
[00:12:11] but you're also walking into a greater opportunity, you know, for, for a lot of us.
[00:12:16] So Michael Thornton is our guest today.
[00:12:18] He is the team lead.
[00:12:20] By the way, he is a local guy here in Chicago.
[00:12:23] And I say that only because when I started the show seven years ago, I only was talking to local Chicago top agents.
[00:12:30] And of course, we've expanded to the whole country.
[00:12:32] We talked to people in every state.
[00:12:34] And rarely do I get a chance to talk to Chicago agents any longer.
[00:12:37] So I'm so excited to talk to one of our own.
[00:12:40] Michael Thornton is the team lead of the Thornton team at Keller Williams Premier Properties,
[00:12:44] which is the number one real estate team in Wheaton, Illinois for 2024,
[00:12:49] as recognized by real trends verified with more than 200 million in lifetime sales.
[00:12:54] And over 400 family serves a Thornton team consistently averages 30 million in annual volume and 60 plus homes sold every year.
[00:13:02] He's also a real estate investor with experiences flipping and owning short term and long term rentals.
[00:13:07] He's a proud Wheaton resident.
[00:13:09] He and his wife and their five children live there in and reside in Wheaton.
[00:13:15] And he's deep ties to the community and he is a deep commitment to client first service.
[00:13:22] And that is what is made the Thornton team, one of the most trusted to recognize names in Wheaton, Glenell and Naperville.
[00:13:28] These are all very affluent suburbs here in Chicago.
[00:13:32] There are upscale suburbs that people who start off in the city oftentimes move out to.
[00:13:38] I am resisting the flight to the suburbs.
[00:13:43] I've been here 25 years.
[00:13:44] I would have probably moved to Glenellin or one of those suburbs because that's where all my friends seem to have gone.
[00:13:51] But I work in the city.
[00:13:52] I live in the city.
[00:13:53] So I'm in the city, but Michael is out there with all of the people I know.
[00:13:57] And boy, is that a competitive market?
[00:13:59] And you know, it's the greater Western suburbs.
[00:14:02] It is super competitive.
[00:14:03] He's crushing it out there.
[00:14:04] And he is here to talk to us about sort of how he built his business.
[00:14:08] But he spends his time outside of work golfing and coaching his son's sports teams.
[00:14:12] He is a father of five.
[00:14:14] He is busy.
[00:14:15] Michael, by the way, before we get on on everyone to follow Michael on Instagram, which is Michael Thornton, one, the number one.
[00:14:22] We'll have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:14:24] Welcome, Michael.
[00:14:26] Thank you so much.
[00:14:26] I'm happy to be here.
[00:14:28] And now I'm going to put you right into my CRM to work on you moving out the cell.
[00:14:32] There you go.
[00:14:32] I could be a client.
[00:14:35] Well, yeah, it's funny.
[00:14:37] I we did look to move out to Oak Park, which is the cloak for those listening.
[00:14:43] That's the closest suburb to the city.
[00:14:45] That was our sort of like, well, we'll go to the suburbs, but not really.
[00:14:49] And then we sort of said, no, we're going to stay here.
[00:14:52] So but we're, we're city kids.
[00:14:53] But that's funny that you said that my wife and I are we got married.
[00:14:56] We said we don't want to live in the city.
[00:14:57] We want the one foot and one foot out.
[00:14:59] So we live in Oak Park.
[00:15:01] A lot of Oak Park is exactly what it is.
[00:15:03] And there's worse places to live.
[00:15:06] And we are so fortunate here in Chicago.
[00:15:08] We just have so much beautiful, you know, opportunity to live,
[00:15:13] whether you're rural or urban.
[00:15:15] And and you are doing a great job.
[00:15:17] Are you originally from that area?
[00:15:20] I'm not actually so I'm from Detroit.
[00:15:21] So I went to Michigan State and the recruiters were all from Chicago.
[00:15:26] Not from Detroit for obvious reasons.
[00:15:28] And I got brought out here to work for craft foods.
[00:15:30] And that was the first nine years of my career.
[00:15:33] I got licensed in real estate halfway through that.
[00:15:35] When I when I started to sense that maybe that wasn't can be my long term play.
[00:15:39] But yeah, that job brought me out to Chicago.
[00:15:41] And my wife has very deep roots here.
[00:15:43] So she grew up in Wheaton.
[00:15:45] And so when we started having kids, we wanted to get close to to my law.
[00:15:49] I always joke that the standard in law jokes don't apply to them.
[00:15:52] They're great to be around.
[00:15:53] It's a lot of fun.
[00:15:53] So we move from Oak Park to Wheaton and the rest of history.
[00:15:57] Yeah, that's wonderful.
[00:15:59] I have a lot of friends craft is headquartered here.
[00:16:01] Well, not so much anymore because now they're craft hines.
[00:16:03] And I don't even know how the corporate structure works there.
[00:16:07] But a lot of my friends were craft people.
[00:16:09] They worked in the suburbs and then they went on to other places like Kellogg and other places.
[00:16:14] But anyway, so you have made that transition from the corporate life into the entrepreneurial life.
[00:16:20] And that is a really a different game.
[00:16:24] And you know, you're walking away from things like benefits and for who encase
[00:16:28] and you know, group health and all of these cool things that are really pretty nice.
[00:16:33] And I assume you probably were thriving within craft because it's a wonderful organization.
[00:16:40] And they just have a great, great, great company.
[00:16:44] And that is a career right there.
[00:16:46] That is a 30, 40 year career.
[00:16:48] It's pretty well established pathway.
[00:16:52] And you could rise up the ranks.
[00:16:54] And what sort of caused you to want to leave?
[00:16:58] Yeah, you know, I did have a good experience at craft.
[00:17:00] And I was there during the craft times transition.
[00:17:03] And so I think that was an interesting time.
[00:17:05] And I think, you know, they gave you a lot more on your plate for, you know, I guess a little bit more money.
[00:17:10] But it was an interesting time where you were just getting more and more and more.
[00:17:13] I gained a lot of great experience.
[00:17:14] But I think ultimately I was looking around and I was saying, you know, I see the decision makers
[00:17:19] and the executives and people.
[00:17:20] And of course, I'm only seeing it from a distance.
[00:17:22] But to me, it was like, and I'm not sure what they're building.
[00:17:25] I'm not sure what decision making power they really have.
[00:17:27] It's like to make a decision, you go through 20 different people.
[00:17:30] And nothing actually gets done.
[00:17:31] You spin your wheels.
[00:17:32] And it's either the day like I'll just be honest.
[00:17:34] I love the people that I was working with.
[00:17:36] I love that are really good culture.
[00:17:39] But I, if I'm honest, didn't care if we sold one more box of mac and cheese.
[00:17:42] And so I had to sit there acting like I cared if we sold one more box of mac and cheese.
[00:17:46] And so I just got to the point where I felt like it was more risky for me to stay and not build something
[00:17:53] that I feel like I could do for an entire career versus going to start something that I feel like I could start building.
[00:18:00] And that's where I was looking at it.
[00:18:01] I was doing very well there.
[00:18:03] I was probably one of the youngest people in that kind of ring of leadership.
[00:18:07] And I was doing well.
[00:18:09] But for me, I didn't think I could do that for 30 more years.
[00:18:12] And when I came to that conclusion, I started thinking about what could I do for 30 more years.
[00:18:17] And I've always had an interest in real estate.
[00:18:18] My dad's done it.
[00:18:19] And of course, I said, I'll never do what dad does.
[00:18:21] And here I am.
[00:18:22] But I thought, first, maybe I'd do some investing.
[00:18:24] So I partnered on a flip.
[00:18:26] And I said, man, that's a lot like a job.
[00:18:28] And I like it.
[00:18:29] But I can't do that as I'm working for craft.
[00:18:31] I bought a rental and I said, man, I'll have to own about 50 of these before I can actually replace income.
[00:18:35] That's probably how to path forward.
[00:18:36] And I said, what about the brokerage side?
[00:18:38] I said, I love people.
[00:18:40] I've gained some great experience calling on customers.
[00:18:42] I've been in very high level sales conversations with customers of craft.
[00:18:46] And I feel like I would do a very good job kind of consulting and being in that realm.
[00:18:51] What if I made that job?
[00:18:52] And of course, I made that decision in my head about a year before I mentioned it to my wife.
[00:18:55] And then sprung it on her one day classic.
[00:18:58] Just the worst possible way you could do it.
[00:19:00] Told her I was going to quit my job.
[00:19:01] We just had our third kid.
[00:19:02] We had three kids, four and under.
[00:19:04] And she's like, what?
[00:19:06] No.
[00:19:07] No.
[00:19:08] What are you talking about?
[00:19:10] And so of course, I had a back up a little bit.
[00:19:11] I told her, kind of what I was thinking.
[00:19:13] And she's very supportive.
[00:19:14] And she says, you know what?
[00:19:14] I trust you.
[00:19:15] If you feel like this is something that you want to do, I trust you.
[00:19:19] And from that moment forward, we built a plan which took about other a year.
[00:19:22] You're going to have to play out to where I could build up enough reserves
[00:19:25] to make that jump because I wasn't naive to what I was going to make.
[00:19:29] I said, hey, if I make 25% of what I made leaving craft the first year, that's probably good.
[00:19:34] Hopefully 50% year two, hopefully by year three or four, I'm making roughly the same amount.
[00:19:39] And it's going to be a rough road leading up to that point.
[00:19:41] So I think I was pretty realist on how what it would take, but I was excited for the challenge.
[00:19:47] You know, I love the fact that you thought that far ahead and really prepared.
[00:19:53] Because those first three, four years are rough.
[00:19:57] And there are for everybody, even the ones that, you know, scale to the very top of the mountain.
[00:20:03] And for so many of us, you know, the excitement of getting into real estate might, you know,
[00:20:08] overshadow the reality of those those first few years.
[00:20:12] So and also too, you're not from here.
[00:20:15] So that's the other that your wife is from here, right?
[00:20:17] So your wife is from here, so she has a network of people.
[00:20:20] Obviously, that's great.
[00:20:21] But you don't.
[00:20:22] And you're not selling real estate up in Detroit.
[00:20:25] And yes, you have this network of people you've worked with in corporate America.
[00:20:29] And maybe that became clients, I don't know.
[00:20:32] But what was, how did you start thinking about, oh gosh, now I have to go out and source business.
[00:20:37] You know, what was that pathway?
[00:20:38] How did you figure that out?
[00:20:41] Yeah, so I was, I was lucky.
[00:20:43] I feel like transitioning when I did.
[00:20:45] So I transitioned and I put a bunch of different.
[00:20:49] I was throwing hooks everywhere trying to catch a fish.
[00:20:51] And I didn't really know exactly how I wanted to build a business just yet.
[00:20:54] But the funny thing is, is like, if you do it at all work,
[00:20:56] you just have to focus on what you want to do, what path you want to, you want to go down.
[00:21:01] And I think the one thing I had going for me is I truly had like a burn the ship's mentality.
[00:21:05] I'm not going back to this old world.
[00:21:06] So I will do whatever it takes.
[00:21:08] Things that I'm honest and not willing to do now, I would do before.
[00:21:11] So whether we're working just a ton of open houses, I remember doing some home valuation lead stuff.
[00:21:16] I was buying some stuff on Facebook when Facebook leads, you could still target and get some decent conversation started from there.
[00:21:22] That was actually a big one at the beginning, which doesn't work now, but back then you could spend not that much and get a ton of names
[00:21:28] inquiring where you could reach out.
[00:21:30] And so I was doing some of that cold outreach, but it was off of maybe a home valuation leader or Facebook lead where I had a phone number.
[00:21:37] Somebody that showed some level of intent, even if it was just a cat, it mean to click on that.
[00:21:41] And I never got down the door knocking between open houses, home valuation leads, Facebook leads.
[00:21:45] I was able to do get enough off the ground to start getting that ball rolling down hill.
[00:21:52] And the next thing is too, when I did transition full time, I had about eight or 10 transactions under my belt already.
[00:21:58] Family and friends knew I had a license.
[00:22:01] They trusted me enough to even work with me in a house part time.
[00:22:03] And I wasn't really trying to build anything yet.
[00:22:05] And so I wasn't totally green when I started and that helped me kind of get off to a quicker start.
[00:22:10] I feel like where I wasn't trying to learn the MLS Sunday one.
[00:22:13] I was truly trying to find the first deal.
[00:22:15] Yeah, you know, you did it the hard way, but certainly probably the right way, which is for people who especially have a family, have to support, you're going part time.
[00:22:26] And there is no part time REALTOR.
[00:22:27] So you must have been burning the candle at both ends for quite a while before being able to make that jump.
[00:22:33] And boy, I really admire that.
[00:22:36] I can't imagine how much that of discipline and commitment that must have taken for you.
[00:22:42] I'm not only to save up to be able to do it, but then to also sort of do that transition period.
[00:22:48] You know, you're not a single guy.
[00:22:50] You're your dad.
[00:22:51] You're you've got all these other responsibilities going on.
[00:22:55] And boy, that's a that's a tough commitment.
[00:22:58] But you're right.
[00:22:59] It's this sort of you focus.
[00:23:01] You focus on something.
[00:23:02] What did you, you know, I want to talk about open houses because I hear agents often.
[00:23:09] And they have very very sort of polar responses to open houses either.
[00:23:14] Oh my god, they're the greatest thing ever.
[00:23:16] Or nope, they don't work.
[00:23:19] And I obviously I know they work because they work for some agents and some agents love them.
[00:23:23] And how important are open houses for you today?
[00:23:28] They're not nearly as important for me today as they used to be.
[00:23:31] However, I will say that I know I'm giving away business, but not hosting certain open houses.
[00:23:35] Sure.
[00:23:35] So we'll have team members do open houses.
[00:23:37] And if it doesn't fit for them, we'll have people in our office host open houses.
[00:23:41] What I'll say is the reason why I don't do them is because they're the most difficult
[00:23:45] time I work life balance.
[00:23:46] They're happening Saturday, Sunday.
[00:23:48] When I'm working Saturday or Sunday, it's probably because I'm drafting an offer before
[00:23:51] the due date or I'm showing a property to somebody who's very high in 10, or I'm going
[00:23:55] on a list of the appointment.
[00:23:56] I'm I've kind of come to the conclusion that that's not the best use of my time on a weekend.
[00:24:01] Just because of my family structure.
[00:24:03] Sure.
[00:24:03] And I know there'll be a day that comes soon 10 years from now when they're off and
[00:24:06] doing things to kids that I could die back into that because it absolutely works.
[00:24:10] But I think you have to be a little bit strategic about it.
[00:24:12] Like if you're doing an open house on a house that's been on the market for three weeks,
[00:24:15] probably not going to work too well.
[00:24:16] If you're way out in the boonies, might not work too well.
[00:24:19] But if you have an open house downtown Glen Island right by the metro and you have people
[00:24:23] from the city who don't know a real or yet, and they're taking the train in to go look
[00:24:27] at a few open houses, you're going to meet some people from the city that don't have an
[00:24:30] agent.
[00:24:30] It's actually really a great way to meet people.
[00:24:34] So I think it's, you know, it is something that you can be very strategic.
[00:24:37] Again, if you're closer to the metro, closer to the downtowns, they're going to work
[00:24:40] even better.
[00:24:40] We also started testing the open houses I will do Thursday, four to six.
[00:24:45] You know, you activate the listing in the morning.
[00:24:48] People see it.
[00:24:49] You do a weekday open house.
[00:24:50] You capture commuters coming off the train and you can get a lot of foot traffic or even
[00:24:55] on a Friday.
[00:24:55] So we're, you know, I'm still doing a little bit of that, but it might be more of like
[00:24:59] a Thursday evening first look open house versus Saturday or Sunday.
[00:25:02] But if I was a new agent, I would absolutely be doing them.
[00:25:05] Yeah.
[00:25:06] Oh, yeah.
[00:25:06] You should be doing them every weekend as much as you can.
[00:25:10] Lead, lead, lead follow up, follow up.
[00:25:12] I want to talk about, you know, you've got five kids at home.
[00:25:15] I want to just, let's just address that right away because that is a meh.
[00:25:20] I mean, it's a blessing and a massive obstacle, right?
[00:25:23] Like that is a valid.
[00:25:24] It doesn't mean that any sort of pejority.
[00:25:26] It is, it is a wonderful thing.
[00:25:28] And it is a lot.
[00:25:30] So how do you manage that you and your wife with five kids and you're running a business?
[00:25:36] Yeah.
[00:25:36] So my wife was a nurse for several years and that was, that was really difficult because
[00:25:41] she was working nights.
[00:25:43] And so that would lock up certain week nights where I couldn't be showing property and she
[00:25:46] was gone working.
[00:25:48] Thankfully, she's, she's not working anymore.
[00:25:50] I mean, she loved it, but she's not working anymore.
[00:25:52] So she's, that's, that's a little bit of help.
[00:25:53] But I think it just, it forced me to be honest with how I needed to set up my, my team.
[00:25:59] Many people would say that first hire needs to be an executive assistant.
[00:26:02] I didn't do that first.
[00:26:04] I actually went and, and partnered with an agent who's still with me today.
[00:26:07] His name's Kyle Kack.
[00:26:08] He's fantastic.
[00:26:09] And I said, Hey, the thing that's stopping me from, from getting from 15 million to 25
[00:26:14] million is evenings.
[00:26:16] It's being available in the evenings.
[00:26:18] And, and so I partnered with Kyle and we, between us, we were able to cover
[00:26:23] everything we needed to cover.
[00:26:25] And he was leveraged for me in the evenings.
[00:26:27] And now we have three agents on the team.
[00:26:29] And so we have a showing calendar where we can, make sure we all can live our lives, but
[00:26:33] still be available for clients.
[00:26:35] And so literally each night of the week, we know who's covering who.
[00:26:38] And we're all there available to service clients on the team, depending on who's got
[00:26:43] that covered.
[00:26:43] So that was important for me to be realistic that I'm not going to really grow this business
[00:26:47] unless I'm available outside of normal work hours.
[00:26:49] And I need somebody to help me with that.
[00:26:51] And if I can't do that, I'll be stuck at 15 million forever.
[00:26:54] Yeah, you have to be really intentional about structure, I guess, with five, with five
[00:27:00] kids because obviously they're, they're on structure, you know, activities.
[00:27:05] And you, and knowing like, okay, I can't do evenings at certain times.
[00:27:10] So I need to, I need to solve for that.
[00:27:13] And yeah, really, really smart.
[00:27:15] I imagine a lot of the skills that you learned or developed or, you know, brought into
[00:27:22] the corporate world where you were.
[00:27:25] I imagine some of that problem solving was able to be transitioned over into real estate.
[00:27:31] Can you talk a little bit about that?
[00:27:32] Because I see you as somebody who is able to take some of these, these challenges and
[00:27:38] see them as, as, you know, sort of opportunities to create structure.
[00:27:44] Yeah, I think that was honestly, if I was to say, you know, what's the superpower?
[00:27:48] What makes me successful?
[00:27:49] I think it's, it is that corporate America experience where I saw consultants coming in
[00:27:55] and helping us with our businesses.
[00:27:56] And I said, hey, that's really what a real estate should be, is a consultant.
[00:27:59] And what's great about a consultant is they're, they're wonderful communicators, but they,
[00:28:03] they present a plan and they present to you, hey, this is what we're going to do.
[00:28:07] This is what's going to happen next.
[00:28:08] I'm going to come in and check in and they continue to forward pace you down and lay out
[00:28:14] the process about things they're going to play out, but they also have contingency plans
[00:28:17] and they also can lay out pros and cons, everything like that.
[00:28:20] So I learned to be very systematic, just based on that experience and having to call on
[00:28:25] customers and to be very fact based and know you're competing against other big brands
[00:28:29] or doing the same thing.
[00:28:30] And so for me, bringing that into real estate is just okay, I need to be very structured.
[00:28:35] To your point, I need to treat this like a job.
[00:28:36] I'm going to come in, I'm going to drop my kids off at school and go right into the
[00:28:40] office and I'm going to work at least nine to five and go home, be with them.
[00:28:44] It'll be a couple of weeks or a couple of nights a week, where I'll be out showing Kyle's
[00:28:48] going to help with the rest.
[00:28:49] Weekends, I'll do the most important activities.
[00:28:51] Like, I'll make it all work.
[00:28:52] I'll still get my 55 hours in, but I'm going to be strategic about it so that I'm not,
[00:28:56] not at my kids' events, but be very strategic about it and then be very efficient, systematic.
[00:29:03] And, and I think that's what's helped us.
[00:29:04] Like, when I think back to feedback that we've received, and this is a good, better and
[00:29:08] different, it's just, when people don't say, hey, we're so fun to work with.
[00:29:11] And that's great if you are, or hey, great negotiator and I think we are.
[00:29:15] But they've said, by far the most, thank you for your professionalism.
[00:29:19] And I think that word speaks back to what you mentioned is my previous experience.
[00:29:25] Because if you don't have that, you're not going to be in the room having those discussions
[00:29:29] with those customers.
[00:29:30] You got to be buttoned up, you got to be systematic, you got to do what you say you're
[00:29:33] going to do.
[00:29:33] You have to be a good communicator and you need to be strategic and lay out pros and
[00:29:38] cons.
[00:29:38] And all that stuff plays really well in real estate and turns out not many people can do it.
[00:29:42] Yeah, I, my first, one of my first jobs out of college, I worked for Anaheiser Bush in
[00:29:46] St. Louis and I did marketing for them.
[00:29:48] And I do nothing about, about beer, really.
[00:29:51] But they were the number one and maybe they still are.
[00:29:53] I'm not sure.
[00:29:54] Number one beer, you know, sort of a distributor and manufacturer in the country,
[00:29:59] buy a wide margin and they own most of the brands that people don't even realize are
[00:30:04] are, are thorough brands.
[00:30:06] And I learned, oh, this is why they're number one.
[00:30:10] It's not the product necessarily is better.
[00:30:12] It's, you know, product beer is kind of beer.
[00:30:14] It's like, you like what you like, but it's not necessarily that it's so much higher
[00:30:18] and quality.
[00:30:19] But they just have a different expectation that is set for the people that work there.
[00:30:25] It is like, oh, no, we do things differently here.
[00:30:27] And we are going to outpace our competitors because we're more professional.
[00:30:32] And they have certain, I mean, it's funny if you think about beer and how it's kind of a silly
[00:30:36] industry, but it is, it is something that they took very seriously.
[00:30:40] And I had to take seriously it.
[00:30:42] It's kind of a weird dichotomy of like learning how to be ultra professional in this kind of
[00:30:47] goofy business.
[00:30:48] But, but it was, it was awesome because it was like, oh, we, we would, you know, I won't
[00:30:53] get into too many details, but they would look at like when we would drive our trucks
[00:30:57] up for marketing events.
[00:30:58] They would look at the, at the chrome, the chrome things on the wheels, like how shiny
[00:31:04] are the chrome?
[00:31:05] It's like, what does that have to do with beer?
[00:31:06] It has everything to do with it.
[00:31:07] You know, it's like everything has to be perfect.
[00:31:10] And so, of course, you know, these are things that you learn in corporate America when
[00:31:16] you're number one and why you're number one.
[00:31:19] And craft, of course, is, is plays in that space as well.
[00:31:22] And so I think that that is absolutely accurate.
[00:31:25] You know, you, you see this kind of unstructured world of real estate being a REALTOR.
[00:31:30] And you can kind of do what you want.
[00:31:32] You can kind of create your own brand.
[00:31:35] You can create your own process.
[00:31:37] And the people that do really well have really professional brands and processes.
[00:31:42] And I, I see that in you.
[00:31:44] And I'm certainly want to talk a little bit about that.
[00:31:48] I want to shift gears just a bit and talk about being referral based because obviously
[00:31:53] that's what everybody wants.
[00:31:54] And you are now in that season of your business where you're getting a lot of referrals, I'm
[00:32:00] sure.
[00:32:01] So tell us about how you keep that growing.
[00:32:04] Obviously, that is the highest ROI is referrals.
[00:32:07] So tell us a little bit about, you know, how you, how you do that and, you know, what,
[00:32:12] what that process is.
[00:32:13] Yeah.
[00:32:13] Yeah.
[00:32:13] There's a few things that come to mind.
[00:32:15] It's very related to what we're just talking about actually with systems and standards.
[00:32:19] What do you think about somebody reaching their neck out to refer you?
[00:32:23] They want to be confident on what that person is going to receive.
[00:32:26] And they feel like you were just fine by the senior pants throughout that transaction,
[00:32:29] even if they look well, they might be a little bit more reluctant to refer you because
[00:32:32] they're not sure exactly what the next person is going to receive.
[00:32:35] When they get the sense that what we were doing is very systematic and we have touch points
[00:32:40] that are defined.
[00:32:42] I came to touch base of you on Monday for this reason Tuesday for this reason, Friday
[00:32:45] for that reason.
[00:32:46] And people see that it's thoughtful.
[00:32:49] They are more confident to refer you.
[00:32:50] We've all been in that situation where I have a painter that's awesome, but the minute
[00:32:54] he doesn't call somebody back, I'm like, I don't know if I can, I don't know if I can
[00:32:58] do that.
[00:32:58] I'm, this is my reputation.
[00:33:00] So somebody that's very buttoned up and has that I'll figured out is going to get
[00:33:04] referrals.
[00:33:04] I think as an agent, you need to think about, you need to think about systems and standards
[00:33:09] and then you need to think about ways that you can surprise and delight people to make
[00:33:13] them know that you care about them because they're going to feel like indebted to you.
[00:33:18] And that's, and that's what we want to be doing anyways about people that create experiences.
[00:33:20] So we think about thoughtful touch points throughout the process.
[00:33:23] Hey, you're through a tourney review.
[00:33:25] Here's a bag of coffee from your favorite spots.
[00:33:27] Hey, here's some go-go juice for the, you know, the packing you're going to have to do.
[00:33:32] Handwritten notes for different reasons, events.
[00:33:34] We like to get people together all the time after the transaction to tell them, this is
[00:33:39] a lifelong partnership.
[00:33:40] We want to be your lifelong real estate advisor.
[00:33:43] And we're not going to reach out to you six months from now asking about real estate.
[00:33:47] We're going to invite you to our App Yaw event.
[00:33:49] We're going to invite you to the dumpster event.
[00:33:51] So you can throw all your crap.
[00:33:53] We're going to invite you to this or that.
[00:33:55] We want to reach out with something of value and not to get more business from you.
[00:34:00] And so when we stay in front of people in that type of way, they feel like they're not
[00:34:03] going to tense up when you call them.
[00:34:05] That's the worst thing you can do if you want referrals is to be always asking for business
[00:34:08] so that when they call you, you train them to put the phone down and not talk back
[00:34:13] because they know you're going to have an awkward conversation with them.
[00:34:15] Let's not do that.
[00:34:16] And the next thing I would say is outside of systems, surprising and delighting, is just
[00:34:22] really being thoughtful and not in an idiot with the question of how's the market.
[00:34:28] I feel like that's the number one question you get is how's the market.
[00:34:31] And you could just be living your normal life with kids at the game and you're going to
[00:34:34] get asked that question.
[00:34:36] And that's the difference between a referral or not because if you say it's hot or it's
[00:34:40] not, or like whatever, that's just such a basic answer.
[00:34:43] It doesn't mean anything.
[00:34:44] And so get to know people through that question, ask questions back and show them that you
[00:34:48] know more than what they can find out on Zillow and you're going to get referrals.
[00:34:53] I couldn't agree more.
[00:34:55] And you know with with AI now, we really don't have an excuse not to have an answer to
[00:34:59] that question because you could literally pull up a chat GPT, ask that question via voice
[00:35:05] and get an answer back and you could parent that exact answer if if you want to.
[00:35:10] So yeah, everybody should that is the number one question you get is how's it's funny.
[00:35:14] I get that question and I'm not a practicing agent and I always I have my wrote answer,
[00:35:20] which is you don't want me to answer that question because I don't know as much.
[00:35:23] I can tell you more about marketing and this and that.
[00:35:26] I can tell you how our agents are doing, but as far as the market itself, I don't know,
[00:35:30] but I'm always impressed with agents that do know.
[00:35:32] And I ask agents, how's the market because I don't know.
[00:35:35] And the good agents have an answer and not only do they have an answer,
[00:35:40] they're excited to talk about it because they know this is what they're into.
[00:35:44] And I think that's really important is getting passionate about some of these,
[00:35:48] these data or this information because that of course comes out when when you're like,
[00:35:54] oh, let me tell you actually condos are up right now or you know,
[00:35:57] single family homes are not doing so well or whatever, you know, whatever the data might be.
[00:36:01] And the idea too is people say, how's the market?
[00:36:05] That's really an invitation to have a conversation because how's the market
[00:36:09] could be one of a million questions really?
[00:36:11] It's not really a question.
[00:36:13] It's you have to get about seven more questions deep before you could actually answer that question.
[00:36:17] So now it's like, oh, hey, that's a great question.
[00:36:20] Tell me where you live.
[00:36:22] Exactly.
[00:36:23] You nailed it.
[00:36:24] That's invitation to have like a real estate conversation.
[00:36:26] And it's probably like the best opener because when somebody asks you that at people do every day,
[00:36:35] it's like all of us, they don't realize what they're really asking.
[00:36:37] It's kind of like saying to a stockbroker house, the market, it's like, well, you know, there's
[00:36:42] what do we have to ask?
[00:36:44] Yeah, well, that's the whole point and that's how you can show them that you know more
[00:36:46] and your little more strategic is, you know, the answer, the answer is always, it depends what
[00:36:51] your situation that are you a buyer, a seller, are you in the luxury price range, are you in the
[00:36:55] entry level, are you in Wheaton, are you in hints?
[00:36:58] Like the answer is like, it depends.
[00:37:00] Let me hear more.
[00:37:01] And that to your point invites a conversation.
[00:37:04] And through those questions, I think they can understand quickly that it's not so simple.
[00:37:08] It's not just, oh, it's it's hot or it's not.
[00:37:11] And that this person is pretty thoughtful.
[00:37:13] And they're asking great questions.
[00:37:14] I think they could leave that conversation like, hey, that person kind of knows what they're talking
[00:37:18] about.
[00:37:19] And then if you compare that with visibility online where they can kind of learn more about you,
[00:37:23] like that's why Instagram is important for us is when we're at our kids events and that's what
[00:37:27] makes kids actually the one thing is like easy prospecting.
[00:37:31] You're at the game, you're coaching your kids team and you ask, you answer that question one time
[00:37:35] and then you're following each other on social media and they say the proof, the proof of the results
[00:37:39] through social media, the next conversation might be, hey, do you mind if we talk some time and
[00:37:43] that's happened plenty to where it's an easy way in to have like a deeper conversation about
[00:37:49] doing business together.
[00:37:50] And that's like one of our best forms of getting businesses just, I call a prospecting but
[00:37:54] it's really just living your life with your kids answering that question well and also following
[00:37:58] each other on social media where they can see that you know what you're doing and that this isn't
[00:38:02] just a hobby.
[00:38:04] I want to talk about social media and how you utilize it to communicate mastery.
[00:38:09] And I think that's something that it's really important to you because you've just now talked
[00:38:13] about this.
[00:38:14] That you meet somebody, you're sharing social handles and now it's like this person now needs to see
[00:38:22] when they are scrolling through Instagram or TikTok or Facebook that I actually have information
[00:38:27] that is valuable to them.
[00:38:29] So tell me a little bit about how you think about marketing on social media.
[00:38:34] We've transitioned a little bit.
[00:38:36] I was a little bit to you know I think about it as a funnel right.
[00:38:39] Top of funnel is broad information that many people might care about.
[00:38:42] Bottom of funnel might be somebody in a real estate transaction.
[00:38:45] It's more natural for me to be bottom of funnel.
[00:38:47] Talk about escalation clauses and this and that.
[00:38:49] Multiple offers.
[00:38:50] The problem is nobody really cares about it.
[00:38:52] You have to be in a transaction to care about it and if you're in a transaction you're probably
[00:38:55] working with somebody that isn't me whatever you know.
[00:38:57] So it's like okay how do we how do we sprinkle in bottom of funnel but not make our page about
[00:39:02] that. So what we arrived at a couple of years ago probably a year and a half ago which has
[00:39:06] really helped us a lot is say okay we want to be top of funnel but something is still very
[00:39:10] relevant to our target consumer. And so we're going to focus on being the mayor of the
[00:39:14] Western suburbs of Chicago.
[00:39:15] 
[00:39:16] We're going to provide valuable insights that you can care about this information whether you're
[00:39:20] resident somebody looking to relocate or somebody in a transaction and what we're going to
[00:39:24] sprinkle in is real estate data.
[00:39:28] Sprinkle in maybe a green screen where I'm talking about something strategic.
[00:39:31] We're going to sprinkle in a listing video and we're going to sprinkle in a success story.
[00:39:35] Other than that eight out of ten posts are about the town itself.
[00:39:39] And then as you follow we sprinkle in some of the other stuff and that's been way more successful
[00:39:43] for us. We've done a lot more a hell of more leads come in that way and something that we're going
[00:39:48] to continue to double down on and kind of get a little more to YouTube as well since that's ever
[00:39:52] green that that kind of can last forever whereas social media it's kind of gone after people see it
[00:39:56] for 24 hours and so that we can be kind of the mayor of the town that we want to work in.
[00:40:02] Let's dive into that a little further because that is so important and such a great idea.
[00:40:06] We hear this term of becoming a mayor. Basically what you're really talking about is what are
[00:40:12] questions that people who either live there currently have about the area or people who are
[00:40:19] thinking of moving to the area might have and what are those questions? How can I answer those
[00:40:25] questions and be of service to those especially on YouTube as you mentioned because those
[00:40:31] questions and answers can live forever and sprinkling in some real estate fairy dust along the way.
[00:40:37] So you're basically thinking about what do people need to know who live here or who want to move
[00:40:41] here? Is that my understanding? Yeah 100%. I mean the good a good model is hey what are the schools
[00:40:47] like? What are the downtowns like? What's the cost of living between Hensdale and Wheaton because
[00:40:51] it's very different. If you're relocating this is a hidden neighborhood you might not know about
[00:40:56] Sprinkle and Lombard and Villapark. Hey people are getting priced at Elmer's. They're coming here.
[00:41:01] Here's why. Give them a little bit of like peel back the onion some fun facts about the area
[00:41:06] and I think people that are relocating or coming from the city that speaks really like that's what
[00:41:11] they are searching and there's some good resources online where you can I'm forgetting the name
[00:41:16] of their website ask the public or there's a couple different ones where you can go in and actually
[00:41:19] see what people are searching online and you can kind of just answer those questions but honestly
[00:41:24] just go to chat GPT and say hey look I'm trying to attract leads from people relocating. What are
[00:41:28] 15 questions that many people are talking about that I can answer? That people need to know the answer
[00:41:35] too. Exactly. It could even be as simple as who's the best dentist in town right? Like it could
[00:41:40] even be that it could be or what's the best park for kids or whatever. These are non real estate
[00:41:47] related but they are real estate related because you're going to be moving there and you're going to
[00:41:51] be wondering where's the grocery store or what what where's the you know where do I go to get my
[00:41:57] dry cleaning done and I think this is people so many agents neglect this part of it and it's so
[00:42:04] important become the mayor of something some geographic area where you can become the expert in that
[00:42:09] area because if people move in and out of that area or just move within that area you can become
[00:42:14] this hub of information and you can build your entire brand even though you might work outside of
[00:42:20] that area you can build your entire brand within that area and and then you a good business elsewhere
[00:42:25] as too but I think yeah it's like become become the expert at something and provide content you know
[00:42:33] it's so funny we see a lot of although I think it's getting better when I first 15 years ago when I
[00:42:39] first started in this industry in social media I would see REALTORS only doing self-congratulant not
[00:42:44] only but mostly doing self-congratulatory posts like hey look at me I just did this cool thing you
[00:42:49] know and that's fine cool whatever but it doesn't really provide value to the reader for the consumer
[00:42:56] it's just hey I recognize you did this good thing great it's a little bit of a self-pad on the back
[00:43:02] and then I thought you know as years went on I started seeing REALTORS maybe start to come up with
[00:43:09] things that would be actually helpful for people and and I found that that that has not changed
[00:43:15] and that that trajectory for content is you know the need for that content is so is ever growing it's
[00:43:23] always there so that's always what I owe well we can tell a story you tell a story so as I say hey
[00:43:28] I close this house for a million dollars you could say here's how I did this or how here's how we
[00:43:33] achieve this goal for this client it started with this we did that and you can tell a story you can
[00:43:38] do nice carousel and tell a story it's about the client you can talk about how you unlocked a goal
[00:43:42] that they had real estate or maybe the equity that they're able to get over seven years of owning it
[00:43:48] what it allowed their family to do so I think there's ways to like sprinkle in proof of like hey I'm
[00:43:53] good at what I do but also make it about the client I think that's the marketing side of the brain is
[00:43:58] how do we do that to where because everyone wants to hear the story but they don't care about you
[00:44:02] selling a house like they don't care nor should they let's talk about building a trusted brand so
[00:44:10] how do you how do you communicate trust I'd say consistency I'd say always being that consultant
[00:44:19] and having people that you don't need to be rigid but you do need people to fold into your process
[00:44:25] somewhat for a so good example somebody reaches out we had this happen recently hey I'm interested
[00:44:30] in your listing can you show it to me today and you know I think you could communicate trust
[00:44:36] in just a small example hey I would love to share more about this listing with you but it's
[00:44:42] pretty standard for our process to sit down first to have a buyer's consultation talk about your
[00:44:46] situation we would love to hear more about it so we can make sure we can be a great resource for you
[00:44:51] so it's showing professionalism it's helping them you're you're folding them into your process
[00:44:56] not the other way around you're showing them that you're not a door opener now do you want to show
[00:45:00] it yeah probably but should you jump on a Saturday to go do that before you qualify them absolutely
[00:45:05] not so I think having a process sticking to that within a reason doing what you say you're going to do
[00:45:12] and then I think just the the sheer like we talked about social media your brand can be a local
[00:45:18] thing like I have people come up to me now and they're like oh you know I see you everywhere what
[00:45:22] they're really saying is you're probably on social media you're doing the banner at the the
[00:45:27] the wheat and you know the the basketball gym and you're doing the mailer and all these different
[00:45:32] things so like building trust is a little bit about being visible in in in really farming an area
[00:45:39] it's hard to build trust over 15 different towns but I can build a lot of trust in wheat and go
[00:45:43] island because that's why I focus my money on so I think it's what you provide your standards
[00:45:49] your systems but also a bit of like farming a certain area and being a mayor of a certain area
[00:45:54] that together with also making sure that transactions about them and how about you where they feel
[00:46:00] taking care of all that plays into what your brand does yeah customer service I can tell is
[00:46:07] really significant for you and it should be for everyone but it is is the name of the game and
[00:46:13] anyone you work at a company like craft it is all about the customer so we we understand you know
[00:46:18] your customer yeah serve your customer make your customer feel better than they would expect to feel
[00:46:24] working with you and having those standards of practice and that is not something that
[00:46:29] all REALTORS are taught how to do is how do I actually create standards you know what it what
[00:46:35] experience do I want for each of my clients I want to talk a little bit I want to shift into AI
[00:46:40] only because I I suspect you're an AI guy and I want to learn a little bit more about how you
[00:46:46] are leveraging AI for your team and your your brand and how is AI helping you yeah this is one honestly
[00:46:54] if I was a real or I would really take this to heart I think there's an opportunity right now to
[00:47:00] kind of hijack AI's like search algorithm a little bit to where we've been doing a ton of
[00:47:08] blogging that's SEO specific to our area with a a very intentional strategy to show up on AI
[00:47:14] search and I'm not kidding you I had I had a message from somebody in my office two days ago and
[00:47:20] they asked about certain restaurants in Wheaton and the source material was my website for the top
[00:47:24] three the top three answers were source material from blogs from my website so think about that
[00:47:30] they're pulling my blogs that AI probably created they did create about this restaurant which
[00:47:36] then AI used to use as like the search the answer is somebody asking about restaurants in our area
[00:47:41] so think about that like that's huge so blogging used to be the thing 15 years ago then there was
[00:47:46] no reason to do it now I would say build a website it's easy use luxury presence somebody that
[00:47:52] can do it for you and then and then start building SEO rich content whether it's on your Google
[00:47:57] business profile or ideally on your website and make sure that AI has what it needs to recommend
[00:48:03] you or your material and people search so what Mike's talking about is a new way to feed the feed what
[00:48:12] we used to care about is being the number one position on Google in the SEO and if you weren't
[00:48:20] number one number two or number three sort of didn't matter because people didn't scroll usually
[00:48:24] beyond that so you needed to be up for a certain keyword or key phrase that top position but
[00:48:31] things have changed and things are changing and now I don't know if you're like me Mike but I do more
[00:48:37] talking to AI than I do searching and so what AI does which is particularly interesting is AI does
[00:48:44] the searches for you and it will go deep it will go 12 15 pages in so it's no longer so important
[00:48:51] that you are in that top pole position on Google that means it's nice it's certainly good thing
[00:48:57] but if you are page 11 and you've got the best content AI will figure that out over time and return
[00:49:04] that content and serve it up to the user when when they are you know asking questions so you are
[00:49:11] absolutely right and that is something that really I haven't had anybody else say on this podcast
[00:49:16] to date so I appreciate that is creating great content about in this case for REALTOR maybe a particular
[00:49:23] geographic area or a certain subset of information that you want think about what are people searching
[00:49:31] for just like you might make social media content around right content about this because we are
[00:49:36] utilizing AI now to you know it is the Oracle at Delphi we are asking questions it is returning
[00:49:42] us answers and it is getting that information from the live web so this is that's a great great point
[00:49:48] it's going to be all right I am so so grateful that you mentioned that because I need to remember
[00:49:55] that as well yeah I got one more tip if you got so so yeah you can go right into chat you be
[00:50:00] tea this is what I recommend everybody do and say hey I'm you know Billy Bob and I work in this
[00:50:06] area I'm a REALTOR I'm trying to grow my business I'm trying to make it so that people can find
[00:50:10] me online to work with buyers and sellers and investors what are my blind spots what are the things
[00:50:15] I need to do better online so that people can find me prompted something like that I did that and I
[00:50:20] had about 10 different things that I wanted me to do to rank higher in search it was like hey
[00:50:25] your business name varies across these different platforms you need to have a specific
[00:50:30] Thornton team at Keller Williams versus the Thornton team or a Michael Thornton team you need to fix
[00:50:34] that you need to fix your address it's on your old address enough for you different ones because it
[00:50:38] needs to trust that you are the resource and if you have very information that's enough for AI
[00:50:43] to say hey I'm not sure this is trustworthy I can't present that as is truth in the response so the
[00:50:48] better you can show it that this is trustworthy information the better and so it gave me 10 different
[00:50:52] things to do I literally went in and did all those things part of it was like hey you need to
[00:50:56] do some SEO rich blog in these different things talk about schools talk about parks talk about new
[00:51:01] developments things like that so we did and voila depending on who you are and what your question is
[00:51:07] if you're asking about hey what REALTOR should I work with in our area we are ranking and we are
[00:51:12] coming up as a response amazing brilliant and that alone is a great strategy and I heard a great
[00:51:19] answer to a question of how do I use AI better ask AI how you can use it better right so you don't
[00:51:27] have to necessarily even search for how to use utilize AI better although that's great too but you
[00:51:32] can ask it it is the best source of its own information so Mike that is such such a brilliant idea
[00:51:39] thank you so much for that I want to talk about team structure to sort of wrap us up here because
[00:51:45] you have a unique team structure and I want to I think teams are really at a pivotal point right now
[00:51:51] in real estate where we're sort of you know moving into there's more teams now than there has
[00:51:58] ever been and I want to talk about why teams are important and tell us about your structure yeah
[00:52:05] so I view our team as a shared infrastructure team so what I mean by that is the real benefit of
[00:52:09] our team is that we can all have a life we have somebody that can cover what another they can tap
[00:52:14] into Lindsey who's our marketing and staging you know she works with our team and so if you're on
[00:52:19] our team you have full access to all our staging services she'll do the installs you know she'll
[00:52:25] do all your marketing from like newsletter she'll do all the stuff on social media that doesn't
[00:52:30] involve me speaking she's doing that putting that all together and she'll do that for team members
[00:52:35] so every team's you know set up differently so we're not a ton of like hey we're going to just
[00:52:39] feed you leads all day long there's an element of that or there's an element of like hey you
[00:52:43] you know you can work this open house or hey this buyer I'm at capacity I need you to work it
[00:52:48] but what I would say is we're a shared infrastructure team we're there to be leveraged for one another
[00:52:54] and the most important thing about building a team and this is what we do eyes wide open as we
[00:52:59] build a value proposition so we are all on the same page people might want to leave a team for
[00:53:03] different reasons that's okay but I don't want them to leave because they feel like they can make
[00:53:07] more money somewhere else so we have a structure and I know that if I don't pretty much feed Kyle
[00:53:13] a deal on a plate once a year the value might not be there between all the other things we're paying
[00:53:18] for in the staging like he might be able to make more somewhere else so I need to know hey I need
[00:53:24] I need to make sure he gets a few leads he gets a deal from just me in addition to all the other
[00:53:29] things we're doing but he's tapping into all the events he's tapping into all the different things
[00:53:32] that we're doing to make this work because I don't want him to have to leave and I want him to feel
[00:53:38] like he is not going to outgrow the team that's my number one thing and so I might make a little bit
[00:53:43] less compared to some team leaders but we have great you know Allison's been with me for a long time
[00:53:49] Kyle like they've all retention's very good because I feel like I created a structure that
[00:53:55] I'm sensitive to and part of the reason I love corporate America's I feel like I had that ceiling
[00:53:58] I don't want them to feel like they have a ceiling because I wouldn't want that I was trying to
[00:54:01] answer the question of why wouldn't I join a team and let me take care of that right away
[00:54:06] so that you could be on this team build your own brand still tap into the infrastructure and grow
[00:54:12] without a ceiling yeah I think those are wonderful answers and really great suggestions for people
[00:54:19] who are looking to either join a team or build a team think about what you're offering why you're
[00:54:23] offering and why somebody should join you or why you should join another team and what you're
[00:54:28] bringing to value if you are joining a team like why should they bring you on and make sure it's
[00:54:34] a symbiotic relationship I want to thank Michael Mike we really appreciate your time today you

And now, onto our show. Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team? Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agents needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now onto the show. Hello and welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide and host through the show. And just a moment, we're going to be speaking top producer Mike Thornton. Before we get to Mike, as if you are new here, welcome. If you are new, actually if you are returning, welcome back. We appreciate you and please, as always, the best way you can help us grow. Tell a friend about this podcast. What we do here is interview the top agents in the country and say, how'd you do that? And then we pass those over to you so you can learn and do what they have doing and are still doing today to grow their business so you can be just like them. I have a thing I built for everyone. So before we get to the interview, I want to tell you about it. I want you to use it. Use it as much as you can. Tell everybody about it. It's totally free. And I want your feedback. So I created a listing rewriter. And what I did is this was based on a problem I saw where agents would be using AI to rewrite their listing descriptions, but they didn't really get success with it. In fact, everybody was kind of doing it the same way. So all the listing descriptions in someone's area, you could tell if they were AI or not. And they just, if everyone looks the same, it's not that great. And they just also weren't that great. So what we, what I did is I have it now running through a six stage approach where it's literally rewriting it six different times from six different experts, ones like a fiction, best telling author, ones a journalist, ones that edited a newspaper, people like that who can really know how to write good copy. And it's going to give you three different variations of your existing listing description. So here's what you do. You go to listing.joincal.com listing.joincal.com. And you put in a listing description. You give me your address because I'm going to email it to you. And then you put in just a little info about the property because what we're going to do, not just rewrite your listing description, we're going to take a look at the surrounding areas. And we're going to see, did you miss anything? Are there parks or their, you know, schools? Are there features in the neighborhood or the community that are close to this property that you need to be talking about? Or we're also going to look to see it past listings for this address. Did you miss something? Is there something in a past listing that you're not featuring in your listing description or in your listing itself? So we're going to find that. We're going to add that for you. I'm telling you I've got nothing but amazing feedback on this. All I did was rewrite you a really good AI query. It's totally free, like I said. It's my gift to you. I want you to try it listing.joincal.com. Let me know if it works better for you. I used it myself, sold my condo in two days in November. And for the highest amount ever for a condo of my tier in my building, maybe that's just coincidence. I don't know, but it certainly didn't hurt to have an amazing listing description. So check it out listing.joincal.com. Give me your feedback and I'll keep building these tools for you because I like it. It's fun. And I'm really digging the whole vibe coding thing. So I'm working on my next tool. By the way, I'll tell you, give you a sneak preview. It's called Why is My Listing Not Selling? So it's kind of a similar idea where you're going to basically paste in your listing. You're listing. I'm trying to figure out how to do this. That's a little bit tricky actually. We can't scrape Zillow, which would be great if we could, but they don't let you do that. So I have to figure out how you can get your listing over to us. But once you do that, we're going to have it go about 20 different data points and figure out what are some reasons. Is including things like are your photos no good? Like it's even going to look at that, but it's going to look at other data driven things like, you know, comps and inventory and the current rates for borrowers and just lots of different different different data points so that we can figure out why is your home not selling so that you don't lose the listing. And you can give this to your client and say, Hey, here's why the home is not selling. So I'm working on that. That'll also be free at least at first and maybe I'll charge it on the road, but who knows. So I'm really excited about that one too, but check out listing. Join kale.com. Give it a try. Tell me if you like it and please use it. Tell your friends. All right. On my interview with Mike Thornton. Thanks. Best advice you've received in real estate. Best advice. I'd say it comes from my father. He is a REALTOR of about 50 years. And so he would come home after work and he'd say, Michael, in this business, you can't get too high and you can't get too low. And I was like, at the time, I didn't really understand what he was talking about, but I think it was either a day where he cashed a big check or a day where he lost a big check. And he would say, you know, you can't get too high or you too low. And I think that that resonated with me when I got into this business because, you know, I transitioned from a very steady job into this and the first year getting over the hill was very difficult. And three out of my first six deals fell through. And I was very much questioning whether I should be in this industry or not. And I drew back on that advice and I think it's true. And I think it also kind of speaks to, you know, you don't want the transaction to be about you. The clients need to feel like it's about them because it is. And if you have this grip on the transaction that's unhealthy, I think everybody can sense that and successful REALTOR don't have that. I think that's really wise advice. And I also love the idea of the not getting too high or too low because if you celebrate too much of a victory, the opposite is going to happen as well. You have to, you know, almost, you know, when those challenging moments happen, you're going to feel those much more deeply than, you know, so it's almost better to, I think, maintain a slightly stoic response, not to not celebrate when things are good, but to realize that everything's fluid. Everything moves. There's always challenge. There's always good things that happen. And they just kind of move it and out and never to be too moved. Like kind of thinking of it as like a mountain. Like there's storms that come. There's, there's, you know, bright sunny days. The mountain doesn't move. The mountain just absorbs it all. So, yeah, I mean, we're talking, you know, in December, and I think it's, it gets highlighted this time of year because for me, the way my brain works is, I'm starting at zero. I'm starting at zero right now because I'm booking business for next year. And just the way I operate, I want to grow each year and provide a better product each year. And so the last transaction really doesn't mean anything. It means hopefully you deliver a great experience, but as far as it can't carry you into your next paycheck necessarily. So I think this business is unique. It's not like if we are financial advisors, we have a book of business and we maintain it. We have to go find our next meal if we want to eat in Peter family. Yeah. If somebody could ever figure out how to, you know, charge like a financial advisor, where it's, you know, percentage of assets under management, where you're getting one percent a year. They do. Boy, they are not starting over from zero every year, but REALTORS are. So you're right. So you can't really celebrate because you got to eat, you got to eat next. And all right. So wonderful advice there. Worst advice you've received. So I think this was well meaning advice. It was not to, the advice was not to lead my corporate American job to do real estate. And I think it, I think it meant well. I think the perception was I was leaving something very steady to go to something that's not steady. And that's true to begin with. However, that wasn't true for my personality and what I was looking to do. I wasn't fired up going into that job that I was holding where I wasn't building anything. I was looking around and I was seeing people that were necessarily happy. I didn't have autonomy, had a cap ceiling. And I've seen so many restructuring that I wouldn't consider that safe at all. I consider what I'm doing now much safer where I have control to a certain extent over my success. I mean, you know, there's different factors, but I can decide where I take this and I have nobody else to blame if it doesn't work out. And so for me, that was less risky because I was betting on myself. And so I think the advice was, you know, it was might, might make sense to some, but for me, it wasn't what I needed to hear. I needed to hear, hey, you got this, you're going to, you're going to make this work. You love people, you're smart. You're going to carry those previous experiences into real estate and do something really special. And that's what I did believe in my wife and I had those conversations when we made that transition. And she's like, I trust you. I know you can do this. And I think that's what helped me kind of catapult and get past that first year because anybody that starts in this business, so that first year is just treacherous. Oh, sure. Yeah, it's, it's, you know, you're giving up benefits. You're giving up some sort of, well, you're right. You're really not giving up any sort of guarantee because of course, you know, companies go out of business, companies restructure, people get, I was laid off from a company just before I started this job, where I was, had received a perfect review, which I probably shouldn't have received a perfect repub, should have got like a 99 out of 100, but I literally got 100 review. And, and I got it like $15,000 raised. And then literally the next week, they're like, oh, yeah, we're eliminating your position. I was like, what? So, so the idea of not celebrating too much also was a great, great advice because I was like, yeah, it's not making more money. And then I was like, all of a sudden out of a job. So I certainly understand that. And also, you know, you are now running your own business. And I think that is a really great, great advice is you are walking away from some level of certainty, but you're also walking into a greater opportunity, you know, for, for a lot of us. So Michael Thornton is our guest today. He is the team lead. By the way, he is a local guy here in Chicago. And I say that only because when I started the show seven years ago, I only was talking to local Chicago top agents. And of course, we've expanded to the whole country. We talked to people in every state. And rarely do I get a chance to talk to Chicago agents any longer. So I'm so excited to talk to one of our own. Michael Thornton is the team lead of the Thornton team at Keller Williams Premier Properties, which is the number one real estate team in Wheaton, Illinois for 2024, as recognized by real trends verified with more than 200 million in lifetime sales. And over 400 family serves a Thornton team consistently averages 30 million in annual volume and 60 plus homes sold every year. He's also a real estate investor with experiences flipping and owning short term and long term rentals. He's a proud Wheaton resident. He and his wife and their five children live there in and reside in Wheaton. And he's deep ties to the community and he is a deep commitment to client first service. And that is what is made the Thornton team, one of the most trusted to recognize names in Wheaton, Glenell and Naperville. These are all very affluent suburbs here in Chicago. There are upscale suburbs that people who start off in the city oftentimes move out to. I am resisting the flight to the suburbs. I've been here 25 years. I would have probably moved to Glenellin or one of those suburbs because that's where all my friends seem to have gone. But I work in the city. I live in the city. So I'm in the city, but Michael is out there with all of the people I know. And boy, is that a competitive market? And you know, it's the greater Western suburbs. It is super competitive. He's crushing it out there. And he is here to talk to us about sort of how he built his business. But he spends his time outside of work golfing and coaching his son's sports teams. He is a father of five. He is busy. Michael, by the way, before we get on on everyone to follow Michael on Instagram, which is Michael Thornton, one, the number one. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. Welcome, Michael. Thank you so much. I'm happy to be here. And now I'm going to put you right into my CRM to work on you moving out the cell. There you go. I could be a client. Well, yeah, it's funny. I we did look to move out to Oak Park, which is the cloak for those listening. That's the closest suburb to the city. That was our sort of like, well, we'll go to the suburbs, but not really. And then we sort of said, no, we're going to stay here. So but we're, we're city kids. But that's funny that you said that my wife and I are we got married. We said we don't want to live in the city. We want the one foot and one foot out. So we live in Oak Park. A lot of Oak Park is exactly what it is. And there's worse places to live. And we are so fortunate here in Chicago. We just have so much beautiful, you know, opportunity to live, whether you're rural or urban. And and you are doing a great job. Are you originally from that area? I'm not actually so I'm from Detroit. So I went to Michigan State and the recruiters were all from Chicago. Not from Detroit for obvious reasons. And I got brought out here to work for craft foods. And that was the first nine years of my career. I got licensed in real estate halfway through that. When I when I started to sense that maybe that wasn't can be my long term play. But yeah, that job brought me out to Chicago. And my wife has very deep roots here. So she grew up in Wheaton. And so when we started having kids, we wanted to get close to to my law. I always joke that the standard in law jokes don't apply to them. They're great to be around. It's a lot of fun. So we move from Oak Park to Wheaton and the rest of history. Yeah, that's wonderful. I have a lot of friends craft is headquartered here. Well, not so much anymore because now they're craft hines. And I don't even know how the corporate structure works there. But a lot of my friends were craft people. They worked in the suburbs and then they went on to other places like Kellogg and other places. But anyway, so you have made that transition from the corporate life into the entrepreneurial life. And that is a really a different game. And you know, you're walking away from things like benefits and for who encase and you know, group health and all of these cool things that are really pretty nice. And I assume you probably were thriving within craft because it's a wonderful organization. And they just have a great, great, great company. And that is a career right there. That is a 30, 40 year career. It's pretty well established pathway. And you could rise up the ranks. And what sort of caused you to want to leave? Yeah, you know, I did have a good experience at craft. And I was there during the craft times transition. And so I think that was an interesting time. And I think, you know, they gave you a lot more on your plate for, you know, I guess a little bit more money. But it was an interesting time where you were just getting more and more and more. I gained a lot of great experience. But I think ultimately I was looking around and I was saying, you know, I see the decision makers and the executives and people. And of course, I'm only seeing it from a distance. But to me, it was like, and I'm not sure what they're building. I'm not sure what decision making power they really have. It's like to make a decision, you go through 20 different people. And nothing actually gets done. You spin your wheels. And it's either the day like I'll just be honest. I love the people that I was working with. I love that are really good culture. But I, if I'm honest, didn't care if we sold one more box of mac and cheese. And so I had to sit there acting like I cared if we sold one more box of mac and cheese. And so I just got to the point where I felt like it was more risky for me to stay and not build something that I feel like I could do for an entire career versus going to start something that I feel like I could start building. And that's where I was looking at it. I was doing very well there. I was probably one of the youngest people in that kind of ring of leadership. And I was doing well. But for me, I didn't think I could do that for 30 more years. And when I came to that conclusion, I started thinking about what could I do for 30 more years. And I've always had an interest in real estate. My dad's done it. And of course, I said, I'll never do what dad does. And here I am. But I thought, first, maybe I'd do some investing. So I partnered on a flip. And I said, man, that's a lot like a job. And I like it. But I can't do that as I'm working for craft. I bought a rental and I said, man, I'll have to own about 50 of these before I can actually replace income. That's probably how to path forward. And I said, what about the brokerage side? I said, I love people. I've gained some great experience calling on customers. I've been in very high level sales conversations with customers of craft. And I feel like I would do a very good job kind of consulting and being in that realm. What if I made that job? And of course, I made that decision in my head about a year before I mentioned it to my wife. And then sprung it on her one day classic. Just the worst possible way you could do it. Told her I was going to quit my job. We just had our third kid. We had three kids, four and under. And she's like, what? No. No. What are you talking about? And so of course, I had a back up a little bit. I told her, kind of what I was thinking. And she's very supportive. And she says, you know what? I trust you. If you feel like this is something that you want to do, I trust you. And from that moment forward, we built a plan which took about other a year. You're going to have to play out to where I could build up enough reserves to make that jump because I wasn't naive to what I was going to make. I said, hey, if I make 25% of what I made leaving craft the first year, that's probably good. Hopefully 50% year two, hopefully by year three or four, I'm making roughly the same amount. And it's going to be a rough road leading up to that point. So I think I was pretty realist on how what it would take, but I was excited for the challenge. You know, I love the fact that you thought that far ahead and really prepared. Because those first three, four years are rough. And there are for everybody, even the ones that, you know, scale to the very top of the mountain. And for so many of us, you know, the excitement of getting into real estate might, you know, overshadow the reality of those those first few years. So and also too, you're not from here. So that's the other that your wife is from here, right? So your wife is from here, so she has a network of people. Obviously, that's great. But you don't. And you're not selling real estate up in Detroit. And yes, you have this network of people you've worked with in corporate America. And maybe that became clients, I don't know. But what was, how did you start thinking about, oh gosh, now I have to go out and source business. You know, what was that pathway? How did you figure that out? Yeah, so I was, I was lucky. I feel like transitioning when I did. So I transitioned and I put a bunch of different. I was throwing hooks everywhere trying to catch a fish. And I didn't really know exactly how I wanted to build a business just yet. But the funny thing is, is like, if you do it at all work, you just have to focus on what you want to do, what path you want to, you want to go down. And I think the one thing I had going for me is I truly had like a burn the ship's mentality. I'm not going back to this old world. So I will do whatever it takes. Things that I'm honest and not willing to do now, I would do before. So whether we're working just a ton of open houses, I remember doing some home valuation lead stuff. I was buying some stuff on Facebook when Facebook leads, you could still target and get some decent conversation started from there. That was actually a big one at the beginning, which doesn't work now, but back then you could spend not that much and get a ton of names inquiring where you could reach out. And so I was doing some of that cold outreach, but it was off of maybe a home valuation leader or Facebook lead where I had a phone number. Somebody that showed some level of intent, even if it was just a cat, it mean to click on that. And I never got down the door knocking between open houses, home valuation leads, Facebook leads. I was able to do get enough off the ground to start getting that ball rolling down hill. And the next thing is too, when I did transition full time, I had about eight or 10 transactions under my belt already. Family and friends knew I had a license. They trusted me enough to even work with me in a house part time. And I wasn't really trying to build anything yet. And so I wasn't totally green when I started and that helped me kind of get off to a quicker start. I feel like where I wasn't trying to learn the MLS Sunday one. I was truly trying to find the first deal. Yeah, you know, you did it the hard way, but certainly probably the right way, which is for people who especially have a family, have to support, you're going part time. And there is no part time REALTOR. So you must have been burning the candle at both ends for quite a while before being able to make that jump. And boy, I really admire that. I can't imagine how much that of discipline and commitment that must have taken for you. I'm not only to save up to be able to do it, but then to also sort of do that transition period. You know, you're not a single guy. You're your dad. You're you've got all these other responsibilities going on. And boy, that's a that's a tough commitment. But you're right. It's this sort of you focus. You focus on something. What did you, you know, I want to talk about open houses because I hear agents often. And they have very very sort of polar responses to open houses either. Oh my god, they're the greatest thing ever. Or nope, they don't work. And I obviously I know they work because they work for some agents and some agents love them. And how important are open houses for you today? They're not nearly as important for me today as they used to be. However, I will say that I know I'm giving away business, but not hosting certain open houses. Sure. So we'll have team members do open houses. And if it doesn't fit for them, we'll have people in our office host open houses. What I'll say is the reason why I don't do them is because they're the most difficult time I work life balance. They're happening Saturday, Sunday. When I'm working Saturday or Sunday, it's probably because I'm drafting an offer before the due date or I'm showing a property to somebody who's very high in 10, or I'm going on a list of the appointment. I'm I've kind of come to the conclusion that that's not the best use of my time on a weekend. Just because of my family structure. Sure. And I know there'll be a day that comes soon 10 years from now when they're off and doing things to kids that I could die back into that because it absolutely works. But I think you have to be a little bit strategic about it. Like if you're doing an open house on a house that's been on the market for three weeks, probably not going to work too well. If you're way out in the boonies, might not work too well. But if you have an open house downtown Glen Island right by the metro and you have people from the city who don't know a real or yet, and they're taking the train in to go look at a few open houses, you're going to meet some people from the city that don't have an agent. It's actually really a great way to meet people. So I think it's, you know, it is something that you can be very strategic. Again, if you're closer to the metro, closer to the downtowns, they're going to work even better. We also started testing the open houses I will do Thursday, four to six. You know, you activate the listing in the morning. People see it. You do a weekday open house. You capture commuters coming off the train and you can get a lot of foot traffic or even on a Friday. So we're, you know, I'm still doing a little bit of that, but it might be more of like a Thursday evening first look open house versus Saturday or Sunday. But if I was a new agent, I would absolutely be doing them. Yeah. Oh, yeah. You should be doing them every weekend as much as you can. Lead, lead, lead follow up, follow up. I want to talk about, you know, you've got five kids at home. I want to just, let's just address that right away because that is a meh. I mean, it's a blessing and a massive obstacle, right? Like that is a valid. It doesn't mean that any sort of pejority. It is, it is a wonderful thing. And it is a lot. So how do you manage that you and your wife with five kids and you're running a business? Yeah. So my wife was a nurse for several years and that was, that was really difficult because she was working nights. And so that would lock up certain week nights where I couldn't be showing property and she was gone working. Thankfully, she's, she's not working anymore. I mean, she loved it, but she's not working anymore. So she's, that's, that's a little bit of help. But I think it just, it forced me to be honest with how I needed to set up my, my team. Many people would say that first hire needs to be an executive assistant. I didn't do that first. I actually went and, and partnered with an agent who's still with me today. His name's Kyle Kack. He's fantastic. And I said, Hey, the thing that's stopping me from, from getting from 15 million to 25 million is evenings. It's being available in the evenings. And, and so I partnered with Kyle and we, between us, we were able to cover everything we needed to cover. And he was leveraged for me in the evenings. And now we have three agents on the team. And so we have a showing calendar where we can, make sure we all can live our lives, but still be available for clients. And so literally each night of the week, we know who's covering who. And we're all there available to service clients on the team, depending on who's got that covered. So that was important for me to be realistic that I'm not going to really grow this business unless I'm available outside of normal work hours. And I need somebody to help me with that. And if I can't do that, I'll be stuck at 15 million forever. Yeah, you have to be really intentional about structure, I guess, with five, with five kids because obviously they're, they're on structure, you know, activities. And you, and knowing like, okay, I can't do evenings at certain times. So I need to, I need to solve for that. And yeah, really, really smart. I imagine a lot of the skills that you learned or developed or, you know, brought into the corporate world where you were. I imagine some of that problem solving was able to be transitioned over into real estate. Can you talk a little bit about that? Because I see you as somebody who is able to take some of these, these challenges and see them as, as, you know, sort of opportunities to create structure. Yeah, I think that was honestly, if I was to say, you know, what's the superpower? What makes me successful? I think it's, it is that corporate America experience where I saw consultants coming in and helping us with our businesses. And I said, hey, that's really what a real estate should be, is a consultant. And what's great about a consultant is they're, they're wonderful communicators, but they, they present a plan and they present to you, hey, this is what we're going to do. This is what's going to happen next. I'm going to come in and check in and they continue to forward pace you down and lay out the process about things they're going to play out, but they also have contingency plans and they also can lay out pros and cons, everything like that. So I learned to be very systematic, just based on that experience and having to call on customers and to be very fact based and know you're competing against other big brands or doing the same thing. And so for me, bringing that into real estate is just okay, I need to be very structured. To your point, I need to treat this like a job. I'm going to come in, I'm going to drop my kids off at school and go right into the office and I'm going to work at least nine to five and go home, be with them. It'll be a couple of weeks or a couple of nights a week, where I'll be out showing Kyle's going to help with the rest. Weekends, I'll do the most important activities. Like, I'll make it all work. I'll still get my 55 hours in, but I'm going to be strategic about it so that I'm not, not at my kids' events, but be very strategic about it and then be very efficient, systematic. And, and I think that's what's helped us. Like, when I think back to feedback that we've received, and this is a good, better and different, it's just, when people don't say, hey, we're so fun to work with. And that's great if you are, or hey, great negotiator and I think we are. But they've said, by far the most, thank you for your professionalism. And I think that word speaks back to what you mentioned is my previous experience. Because if you don't have that, you're not going to be in the room having those discussions with those customers. You got to be buttoned up, you got to be systematic, you got to do what you say you're going to do. You have to be a good communicator and you need to be strategic and lay out pros and cons. And all that stuff plays really well in real estate and turns out not many people can do it. Yeah, I, my first, one of my first jobs out of college, I worked for Anaheiser Bush in St. Louis and I did marketing for them. And I do nothing about, about beer, really. But they were the number one and maybe they still are. I'm not sure. Number one beer, you know, sort of a distributor and manufacturer in the country, buy a wide margin and they own most of the brands that people don't even realize are are, are thorough brands. And I learned, oh, this is why they're number one. It's not the product necessarily is better. It's, you know, product beer is kind of beer. It's like, you like what you like, but it's not necessarily that it's so much higher and quality. But they just have a different expectation that is set for the people that work there. It is like, oh, no, we do things differently here. And we are going to outpace our competitors because we're more professional. And they have certain, I mean, it's funny if you think about beer and how it's kind of a silly industry, but it is, it is something that they took very seriously. And I had to take seriously it. It's kind of a weird dichotomy of like learning how to be ultra professional in this kind of goofy business. But, but it was, it was awesome because it was like, oh, we, we would, you know, I won't get into too many details, but they would look at like when we would drive our trucks up for marketing events. They would look at the, at the chrome, the chrome things on the wheels, like how shiny are the chrome? It's like, what does that have to do with beer? It has everything to do with it. You know, it's like everything has to be perfect. And so, of course, you know, these are things that you learn in corporate America when you're number one and why you're number one. And craft, of course, is, is plays in that space as well. And so I think that that is absolutely accurate. You know, you, you see this kind of unstructured world of real estate being a REALTOR. And you can kind of do what you want. You can kind of create your own brand. You can create your own process. And the people that do really well have really professional brands and processes. And I, I see that in you. And I'm certainly want to talk a little bit about that. I want to shift gears just a bit and talk about being referral based because obviously that's what everybody wants. And you are now in that season of your business where you're getting a lot of referrals, I'm sure. So tell us about how you keep that growing. Obviously, that is the highest ROI is referrals. So tell us a little bit about, you know, how you, how you do that and, you know, what, what that process is. Yeah. Yeah. There's a few things that come to mind. It's very related to what we're just talking about actually with systems and standards. What do you think about somebody reaching their neck out to refer you? They want to be confident on what that person is going to receive. And they feel like you were just fine by the senior pants throughout that transaction, even if they look well, they might be a little bit more reluctant to refer you because they're not sure exactly what the next person is going to receive. When they get the sense that what we were doing is very systematic and we have touch points that are defined. I came to touch base of you on Monday for this reason Tuesday for this reason, Friday for that reason. And people see that it's thoughtful. They are more confident to refer you. We've all been in that situation where I have a painter that's awesome, but the minute he doesn't call somebody back, I'm like, I don't know if I can, I don't know if I can do that. I'm, this is my reputation. So somebody that's very buttoned up and has that I'll figured out is going to get referrals. I think as an agent, you need to think about, you need to think about systems and standards and then you need to think about ways that you can surprise and delight people to make them know that you care about them because they're going to feel like indebted to you. And that's, and that's what we want to be doing anyways about people that create experiences. So we think about thoughtful touch points throughout the process. Hey, you're through a tourney review. Here's a bag of coffee from your favorite spots. Hey, here's some go-go juice for the, you know, the packing you're going to have to do. Handwritten notes for different reasons, events. We like to get people together all the time after the transaction to tell them, this is a lifelong partnership. We want to be your lifelong real estate advisor. And we're not going to reach out to you six months from now asking about real estate. We're going to invite you to our App Yaw event. We're going to invite you to the dumpster event. So you can throw all your crap. We're going to invite you to this or that. We want to reach out with something of value and not to get more business from you. And so when we stay in front of people in that type of way, they feel like they're not going to tense up when you call them. That's the worst thing you can do if you want referrals is to be always asking for business so that when they call you, you train them to put the phone down and not talk back because they know you're going to have an awkward conversation with them. Let's not do that. And the next thing I would say is outside of systems, surprising and delighting, is just really being thoughtful and not in an idiot with the question of how's the market. I feel like that's the number one question you get is how's the market. And you could just be living your normal life with kids at the game and you're going to get asked that question. And that's the difference between a referral or not because if you say it's hot or it's not, or like whatever, that's just such a basic answer. It doesn't mean anything. And so get to know people through that question, ask questions back and show them that you know more than what they can find out on Zillow and you're going to get referrals. I couldn't agree more. And you know with with AI now, we really don't have an excuse not to have an answer to that question because you could literally pull up a chat GPT, ask that question via voice and get an answer back and you could parent that exact answer if if you want to. So yeah, everybody should that is the number one question you get is how's it's funny. I get that question and I'm not a practicing agent and I always I have my wrote answer, which is you don't want me to answer that question because I don't know as much. I can tell you more about marketing and this and that. I can tell you how our agents are doing, but as far as the market itself, I don't know, but I'm always impressed with agents that do know. And I ask agents, how's the market because I don't know. And the good agents have an answer and not only do they have an answer, they're excited to talk about it because they know this is what they're into. And I think that's really important is getting passionate about some of these, these data or this information because that of course comes out when when you're like, oh, let me tell you actually condos are up right now or you know, single family homes are not doing so well or whatever, you know, whatever the data might be. And the idea too is people say, how's the market? That's really an invitation to have a conversation because how's the market could be one of a million questions really? It's not really a question. It's you have to get about seven more questions deep before you could actually answer that question. So now it's like, oh, hey, that's a great question. Tell me where you live. Exactly. You nailed it. That's invitation to have like a real estate conversation. And it's probably like the best opener because when somebody asks you that at people do every day, it's like all of us, they don't realize what they're really asking. It's kind of like saying to a stockbroker house, the market, it's like, well, you know, there's what do we have to ask? Yeah, well, that's the whole point and that's how you can show them that you know more and your little more strategic is, you know, the answer, the answer is always, it depends what your situation that are you a buyer, a seller, are you in the luxury price range, are you in the entry level, are you in Wheaton, are you in hints? Like the answer is like, it depends. Let me hear more. And that to your point invites a conversation. And through those questions, I think they can understand quickly that it's not so simple. It's not just, oh, it's it's hot or it's not. And that this person is pretty thoughtful. And they're asking great questions. I think they could leave that conversation like, hey, that person kind of knows what they're talking about. And then if you compare that with visibility online where they can kind of learn more about you, like that's why Instagram is important for us is when we're at our kids events and that's what makes kids actually the one thing is like easy prospecting. You're at the game, you're coaching your kids team and you ask, you answer that question one time and then you're following each other on social media and they say the proof, the proof of the results through social media, the next conversation might be, hey, do you mind if we talk some time and that's happened plenty to where it's an easy way in to have like a deeper conversation about doing business together. And that's like one of our best forms of getting businesses just, I call a prospecting but it's really just living your life with your kids answering that question well and also following each other on social media where they can see that you know what you're doing and that this isn't just a hobby. I want to talk about social media and how you utilize it to communicate mastery. And I think that's something that it's really important to you because you've just now talked about this. That you meet somebody, you're sharing social handles and now it's like this person now needs to see when they are scrolling through Instagram or TikTok or Facebook that I actually have information that is valuable to them. So tell me a little bit about how you think about marketing on social media. We've transitioned a little bit. I was a little bit to you know I think about it as a funnel right. Top of funnel is broad information that many people might care about. Bottom of funnel might be somebody in a real estate transaction. It's more natural for me to be bottom of funnel. Talk about escalation clauses and this and that. Multiple offers. The problem is nobody really cares about it. You have to be in a transaction to care about it and if you're in a transaction you're probably working with somebody that isn't me whatever you know. So it's like okay how do we how do we sprinkle in bottom of funnel but not make our page about that. So what we arrived at a couple of years ago probably a year and a half ago which has really helped us a lot is say okay we want to be top of funnel but something is still very relevant to our target consumer. And so we're going to focus on being the mayor of the Western suburbs of Chicago. We're going to provide valuable insights that you can care about this information whether you're resident somebody looking to relocate or somebody in a transaction and what we're going to sprinkle in is real estate data. Sprinkle in maybe a green screen where I'm talking about something strategic. We're going to sprinkle in a listing video and we're going to sprinkle in a success story. Other than that eight out of ten posts are about the town itself. And then as you follow we sprinkle in some of the other stuff and that's been way more successful for us. We've done a lot more a hell of more leads come in that way and something that we're going to continue to double down on and kind of get a little more to YouTube as well since that's ever green that that kind of can last forever whereas social media it's kind of gone after people see it for 24 hours and so that we can be kind of the mayor of the town that we want to work in. Let's dive into that a little further because that is so important and such a great idea. We hear this term of becoming a mayor. Basically what you're really talking about is what are questions that people who either live there currently have about the area or people who are thinking of moving to the area might have and what are those questions? How can I answer those questions and be of service to those especially on YouTube as you mentioned because those questions and answers can live forever and sprinkling in some real estate fairy dust along the way. So you're basically thinking about what do people need to know who live here or who want to move here? Is that my understanding? Yeah 100%. I mean the good a good model is hey what are the schools like? What are the downtowns like? What's the cost of living between Hensdale and Wheaton because it's very different. If you're relocating this is a hidden neighborhood you might not know about Sprinkle and Lombard and Villapark. Hey people are getting priced at Elmer's. They're coming here. Here's why. Give them a little bit of like peel back the onion some fun facts about the area and I think people that are relocating or coming from the city that speaks really like that's what they are searching and there's some good resources online where you can I'm forgetting the name of their website ask the public or there's a couple different ones where you can go in and actually see what people are searching online and you can kind of just answer those questions but honestly just go to chat GPT and say hey look I'm trying to attract leads from people relocating. What are 15 questions that many people are talking about that I can answer? That people need to know the answer too. Exactly. It could even be as simple as who's the best dentist in town right? Like it could even be that it could be or what's the best park for kids or whatever. These are non real estate related but they are real estate related because you're going to be moving there and you're going to be wondering where's the grocery store or what what where's the you know where do I go to get my dry cleaning done and I think this is people so many agents neglect this part of it and it's so important become the mayor of something some geographic area where you can become the expert in that area because if people move in and out of that area or just move within that area you can become this hub of information and you can build your entire brand even though you might work outside of that area you can build your entire brand within that area and and then you a good business elsewhere as too but I think yeah it's like become become the expert at something and provide content you know it's so funny we see a lot of although I think it's getting better when I first 15 years ago when I first started in this industry in social media I would see REALTORS only doing self-congratulant not only but mostly doing self-congratulatory posts like hey look at me I just did this cool thing you know and that's fine cool whatever but it doesn't really provide value to the reader for the consumer it's just hey I recognize you did this good thing great it's a little bit of a self-pad on the back and then I thought you know as years went on I started seeing REALTORS maybe start to come up with things that would be actually helpful for people and and I found that that that has not changed and that that trajectory for content is you know the need for that content is so is ever growing it's always there so that's always what I owe well we can tell a story you tell a story so as I say hey I close this house for a million dollars you could say here's how I did this or how here's how we achieve this goal for this client it started with this we did that and you can tell a story you can do nice carousel and tell a story it's about the client you can talk about how you unlocked a goal that they had real estate or maybe the equity that they're able to get over seven years of owning it what it allowed their family to do so I think there's ways to like sprinkle in proof of like hey I'm good at what I do but also make it about the client I think that's the marketing side of the brain is how do we do that to where because everyone wants to hear the story but they don't care about you selling a house like they don't care nor should they let's talk about building a trusted brand so how do you how do you communicate trust I'd say consistency I'd say always being that consultant and having people that you don't need to be rigid but you do need people to fold into your process somewhat for a so good example somebody reaches out we had this happen recently hey I'm interested in your listing can you show it to me today and you know I think you could communicate trust in just a small example hey I would love to share more about this listing with you but it's pretty standard for our process to sit down first to have a buyer's consultation talk about your situation we would love to hear more about it so we can make sure we can be a great resource for you so it's showing professionalism it's helping them you're you're folding them into your process not the other way around you're showing them that you're not a door opener now do you want to show it yeah probably but should you jump on a Saturday to go do that before you qualify them absolutely not so I think having a process sticking to that within a reason doing what you say you're going to do and then I think just the the sheer like we talked about social media your brand can be a local thing like I have people come up to me now and they're like oh you know I see you everywhere what they're really saying is you're probably on social media you're doing the banner at the the the wheat and you know the the basketball gym and you're doing the mailer and all these different things so like building trust is a little bit about being visible in in in really farming an area it's hard to build trust over 15 different towns but I can build a lot of trust in wheat and go island because that's why I focus my money on so I think it's what you provide your standards your systems but also a bit of like farming a certain area and being a mayor of a certain area that together with also making sure that transactions about them and how about you where they feel taking care of all that plays into what your brand does yeah customer service I can tell is really significant for you and it should be for everyone but it is is the name of the game and anyone you work at a company like craft it is all about the customer so we we understand you know your customer yeah serve your customer make your customer feel better than they would expect to feel working with you and having those standards of practice and that is not something that all REALTORS are taught how to do is how do I actually create standards you know what it what experience do I want for each of my clients I want to talk a little bit I want to shift into AI only because I I suspect you're an AI guy and I want to learn a little bit more about how you are leveraging AI for your team and your your brand and how is AI helping you yeah this is one honestly if I was a real or I would really take this to heart I think there's an opportunity right now to kind of hijack AI's like search algorithm a little bit to where we've been doing a ton of blogging that's SEO specific to our area with a a very intentional strategy to show up on AI search and I'm not kidding you I had I had a message from somebody in my office two days ago and they asked about certain restaurants in Wheaton and the source material was my website for the top three the top three answers were source material from blogs from my website so think about that they're pulling my blogs that AI probably created they did create about this restaurant which then AI used to use as like the search the answer is somebody asking about restaurants in our area so think about that like that's huge so blogging used to be the thing 15 years ago then there was no reason to do it now I would say build a website it's easy use luxury presence somebody that can do it for you and then and then start building SEO rich content whether it's on your Google business profile or ideally on your website and make sure that AI has what it needs to recommend you or your material and people search so what Mike's talking about is a new way to feed the feed what we used to care about is being the number one position on Google in the SEO and if you weren't number one number two or number three sort of didn't matter because people didn't scroll usually beyond that so you needed to be up for a certain keyword or key phrase that top position but things have changed and things are changing and now I don't know if you're like me Mike but I do more talking to AI than I do searching and so what AI does which is particularly interesting is AI does the searches for you and it will go deep it will go 12 15 pages in so it's no longer so important that you are in that top pole position on Google that means it's nice it's certainly good thing but if you are page 11 and you've got the best content AI will figure that out over time and return that content and serve it up to the user when when they are you know asking questions so you are absolutely right and that is something that really I haven't had anybody else say on this podcast to date so I appreciate that is creating great content about in this case for REALTOR maybe a particular geographic area or a certain subset of information that you want think about what are people searching for just like you might make social media content around right content about this because we are utilizing AI now to you know it is the Oracle at Delphi we are asking questions it is returning us answers and it is getting that information from the live web so this is that's a great great point it's going to be all right I am so so grateful that you mentioned that because I need to remember that as well yeah I got one more tip if you got so so yeah you can go right into chat you be tea this is what I recommend everybody do and say hey I'm you know Billy Bob and I work in this area I'm a REALTOR I'm trying to grow my business I'm trying to make it so that people can find me online to work with buyers and sellers and investors what are my blind spots what are the things I need to do better online so that people can find me prompted something like that I did that and I had about 10 different things that I wanted me to do to rank higher in search it was like hey your business name varies across these different platforms you need to have a specific Thornton team at Keller Williams versus the Thornton team or a Michael Thornton team you need to fix that you need to fix your address it's on your old address enough for you different ones because it needs to trust that you are the resource and if you have very information that's enough for AI to say hey I'm not sure this is trustworthy I can't present that as is truth in the response so the better you can show it that this is trustworthy information the better and so it gave me 10 different things to do I literally went in and did all those things part of it was like hey you need to do some SEO rich blog in these different things talk about schools talk about parks talk about new developments things like that so we did and voila depending on who you are and what your question is if you're asking about hey what REALTOR should I work with in our area we are ranking and we are coming up as a response amazing brilliant and that alone is a great strategy and I heard a great answer to a question of how do I use AI better ask AI how you can use it better right so you don't have to necessarily even search for how to use utilize AI better although that's great too but you can ask it it is the best source of its own information so Mike that is such such a brilliant idea thank you so much for that I want to talk about team structure to sort of wrap us up here because you have a unique team structure and I want to I think teams are really at a pivotal point right now in real estate where we're sort of you know moving into there's more teams now than there has ever been and I want to talk about why teams are important and tell us about your structure yeah so I view our team as a shared infrastructure team so what I mean by that is the real benefit of our team is that we can all have a life we have somebody that can cover what another they can tap into Lindsey who's our marketing and staging you know she works with our team and so if you're on our team you have full access to all our staging services she'll do the installs you know she'll do all your marketing from like newsletter she'll do all the stuff on social media that doesn't involve me speaking she's doing that putting that all together and she'll do that for team members so every team's you know set up differently so we're not a ton of like hey we're going to just feed you leads all day long there's an element of that or there's an element of like hey you you know you can work this open house or hey this buyer I'm at capacity I need you to work it but what I would say is we're a shared infrastructure team we're there to be leveraged for one another and the most important thing about building a team and this is what we do eyes wide open as we build a value proposition so we are all on the same page people might want to leave a team for different reasons that's okay but I don't want them to leave because they feel like they can make more money somewhere else so we have a structure and I know that if I don't pretty much feed Kyle a deal on a plate once a year the value might not be there between all the other things we're paying for in the staging like he might be able to make more somewhere else so I need to know hey I need I need to make sure he gets a few leads he gets a deal from just me in addition to all the other things we're doing but he's tapping into all the events he's tapping into all the different things that we're doing to make this work because I don't want him to have to leave and I want him to feel like he is not going to outgrow the team that's my number one thing and so I might make a little bit less compared to some team leaders but we have great you know Allison's been with me for a long time Kyle like they've all retention's very good because I feel like I created a structure that I'm sensitive to and part of the reason I love corporate America's I feel like I had that ceiling I don't want them to feel like they have a ceiling because I wouldn't want that I was trying to answer the question of why wouldn't I join a team and let me take care of that right away so that you could be on this team build your own brand still tap into the infrastructure and grow without a ceiling yeah I think those are wonderful answers and really great suggestions for people who are looking to either join a team or build a team think about what you're offering why you're offering and why somebody should join you or why you should join another team and what you're bringing to value if you are joining a team like why should they bring you on and make sure it's a symbiotic relationship I want to thank Michael Mike we really appreciate your time
