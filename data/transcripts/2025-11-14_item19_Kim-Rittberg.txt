[00:01:25] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:28] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage, your team?
[00:01:32] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you
[00:01:34] the answer is always yes.
[00:01:36] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:39] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:41] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:43] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:46] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:50] are looking to leave their brokerage right now,
[00:01:52] and which agents at your own firm
[00:01:55] are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:57] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:02:00] and I've hired over 2,000 agents.
[00:02:02] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:02:04] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:06] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:02:09] for each agent in your market,
[00:02:11] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:14] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went
[00:02:17] and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:19] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:21] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:23] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:25] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:29] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:31] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:33] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:35] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:38] corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:41] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.

[00:02:50] ["Full of Love"]
[00:03:02] Hello, keeping it real listeners.
[00:03:04] I am Kim Rickard and I'm really excited to be back with you.
[00:03:07] I love guest hosting the show.
[00:03:08] And today I want to talk about something super important
[00:03:11] for real estate agents,
[00:03:13] specifically about growing your business
[00:03:14] with content, but also that applies to a lot of things in general.
[00:03:18] So if you don't know me, you should listen to my other episodes.
[00:03:21] But my name is Kim Rickard.
[00:03:22] I'm a six-time award-winning marketer
[00:03:24] and former journalist.
[00:03:26] I worked at Netflix.
[00:03:27] I loved the video unit for us Weekly Magazine.
[00:03:29] And I was a TV producer for about 10 years.
[00:03:32] So I really love to help people figure out what makes them special,
[00:03:35] what makes them shine, and help them leverage video and content
[00:03:38] to grow their business.
[00:03:40] So I've been speaking in the past year,
[00:03:41] a lot of keynotes across the real estate industry.
[00:03:43] And by the way, if you book speakers for keynotes, give me a call.
[00:03:47] I'm kidding, but I'm not kidding.
[00:03:48] I just did two keynotes for exit real estate next home,
[00:03:52] the Women's Council of REALTORS,
[00:03:53] the California Association of REALTORS,
[00:03:55] and I'm speaking at NARNXT.
[00:03:58] And I wanted to discuss something here
[00:04:01] that I've really been thinking about for a long time.
[00:04:03] What is the key to agents who are really driving revenue through video?
[00:04:09] What separates the people who are making a lot of money
[00:04:11] and really understanding and applying how to use content
[00:04:17] to grow their business versus the ones who believe in it
[00:04:19] or bought into it, or perhaps aren't seen that growth.
[00:04:22] And I've been really thinking about it a lot
[00:04:23] because the two things I talk about when I speak at keynotes,
[00:04:27] one is how to convert your content into cash,
[00:04:30] how to use video to actually grow your revenue.
[00:04:33] The other thing I talk about is how to fight fear and how to hate your goals.
[00:04:38] So there's a lot of things that I've realized through my work in TV
[00:04:40] and working with agents and business owners across the country
[00:04:42] is that fear is a lot of the reason why we're not doing something.
[00:04:47] So when I have agents come to me and say,
[00:04:49] I want to be on camera, I want to be on camera,
[00:04:51] nine months later, still not on camera.
[00:04:53] It's not a skill set issue.
[00:04:55] It's really about that mindset piece.
[00:04:57] So I've started thinking about what holds people back
[00:04:59] and have really broken it down into three things.
[00:05:02] And if I'm not going to show you the image here,
[00:05:05] but you can email me and I'll send you this little graphic
[00:05:08] that I have mindset skill set repetition, MSR.
[00:05:14] So what does that mean?
[00:05:16] What is the MSR method?
[00:05:17] You need to have a mindset shift before you can truly grow with video.
[00:05:23] Mindset can be a few different things.
[00:05:25] It is a few different things.
[00:05:26] The biggest one is that you need to be on camera.
[00:05:29] It is important.
[00:05:29] It is important for your business.
[00:05:31] Even if you don't love me on camera,
[00:05:33] you aren't the kid in the school play,
[00:05:35] you didn't look public speaking, that's okay.
[00:05:37] It doesn't matter.
[00:05:38] But really understanding that being yourself on camera
[00:05:41] and figuring out how to be better on camera
[00:05:42] is an important piece of your business.
[00:05:45] That is the number one biggest shift.
[00:05:47] I had it too.
[00:05:48] I was like, I'm going to show them on video
[00:05:50] and people are going to come find me.
[00:05:51] What is that about?
[00:05:53] But that's true.
[00:05:55] I have built my business directly through social media.
[00:05:57] When I decided I was in media, I was an executive
[00:06:00] and I found myself working during childbirth.
[00:06:01] I realized I wanted to grow my business,
[00:06:04] but I quickly realized I was accomplished,
[00:06:06] but anonymous.
[00:06:07] I had to leverage video and social media
[00:06:10] to grow my business.
[00:06:12] That is what I'm committed to helping with agents.
[00:06:15] I love helping agents around the country
[00:06:17] really truly grow your business through video.
[00:06:20] Number one is that mindset shift.
[00:06:23] I know a lot of people say,
[00:06:23] I'm not really scared to be on video.
[00:06:25] I'm like, okay, then why aren't you doing it?
[00:06:27] Once we're through that mindset shift of,
[00:06:30] okay, it's important to be on video.
[00:06:32] Then when we're getting on video,
[00:06:34] I got to be honest.
[00:06:35] Ever since I was out of their own voice.
[00:06:37] That's okay.
[00:06:38] We actually scientifically hear our voice
[00:06:39] differently than other people.
[00:06:41] So it's okay to say, I don't love me on video,
[00:06:44] but it's something I'm going to grow into.
[00:06:45] So the mindset piece is that is really owning
[00:06:48] that you can be on camera.
[00:06:50] You can be good on camera.
[00:06:51] It's not an in-ate talent.
[00:06:53] It is something that you can build
[00:06:55] and also that it is an important part of your business.
[00:06:57] So once you're really harnessing that and you're saying,
[00:07:00] okay, I'm going to do this.
[00:07:01] Then shifting into the skill set mode.
[00:07:03] Now you're bought in, you want to do it.
[00:07:06] You actually have to build the skills
[00:07:09] to be a better speaker, content creator,
[00:07:12] and really build out your team
[00:07:13] who's going to be making this content.
[00:07:15] You can't have one or the other.
[00:07:17] So the mindset is necessary and so is the skill set.
[00:07:23] So skill set looks like,
[00:07:24] I, you know, you can message me and grab my free tips
[00:07:27] at camera.com slash RE tips.
[00:07:30] I can grab you my free tips on five videos
[00:07:33] that get clients for agents that five videos
[00:07:36] you absolutely must make and how to use AI
[00:07:38] to make better videos.
[00:07:40] But when we're talking about skill set,
[00:07:42] it is really understanding how,
[00:07:43] how do you show up confidently on camera?
[00:07:45] Those are scientific methods.
[00:07:47] How do you actually get better on camera?
[00:07:49] And there's also the strategy piece, right?
[00:07:51] Even if you feel good, you feel confident,
[00:07:53] you actually need a strategy, right?
[00:07:54] You need people to understand who you are,
[00:07:56] what you're about and what makes you unique.
[00:07:58] So that's the mindset.
[00:07:59] Then we're talking about the skill set
[00:08:01] and the final piece that people often don't really hit
[00:08:05] and you really need all three of these to be successful.
[00:08:09] Mindset, skill set, repetition.
[00:08:11] You cannot go to the gym once, come home and say,
[00:08:14] where is my six pack?
[00:08:15] You really need to repeat that action.
[00:08:18] It is the same with video.
[00:08:19] It is the same with anything.
[00:08:21] Believing it's important than learning the skills to do it.
[00:08:24] If you don't implement consistently,
[00:08:27] you're not gonna see that benefit.
[00:08:30] And what does that look like?
[00:08:31] So I have some clients and I like to say to people,
[00:08:33] I say with my clients, my agents,
[00:08:34] I say, I don't spend your money, right?
[00:08:35] You decide what budget you're on
[00:08:37] and I'll help you get there no matter your budget.
[00:08:39] So if you're kind of DIY, you're doing it yourself,
[00:08:43] you're trying to do it without a big budget,
[00:08:45] that means holding your feet to the fire.
[00:08:48] Really strong time management.
[00:08:49] If you've been assistant in listing their help,
[00:08:52] maybe they're not editing your videos, maybe they are,
[00:08:54] but having them keep you in line
[00:08:57] and making that content consistently.
[00:09:00] Next, if you have a bigger team,
[00:09:02] it is super important to really, really get your strategy locked up.
[00:09:06] I am a video coach, I am a former executive producer in TV.
[00:09:10] I speak all over the country.
[00:09:12] I cannot tell you how important it is
[00:09:13] to actually have a strategy.
[00:09:15] Showing up is good.
[00:09:16] It helps you build that connection with people.
[00:09:18] You need a strategy that involves credibility and connection.
[00:09:22] You need to make people trust you.
[00:09:24] You need to make people like you.
[00:09:25] You cannot just start showing up and start throwing spaghetti
[00:09:28] at the wall.
[00:09:29] It's really important to go in with a strategy.
[00:09:31] Drop me a line, we'll connect.
[00:09:33] I'll give you some ideas.
[00:09:35] But when we're talking about the repetition piece,
[00:09:37] it doesn't matter if you're doing it on a shissering budget
[00:09:39] or doing it on a large budget, maybe over a big team.
[00:09:42] I can help you figure out who is that person?
[00:09:44] Who are those people?
[00:09:45] Who can help keep it up?
[00:09:47] So my clients, my most successful clients,
[00:09:49] truly, I've worked with them.
[00:09:51] They did my video boot camp coaching program.
[00:09:53] And then I've been supporting them in a low touch way
[00:09:56] for a while.
[00:09:57] They have people helping them.
[00:09:59] They do some of it themselves
[00:10:01] and they do some of it with other people.
[00:10:03] It is hard to do it totally by yourself.
[00:10:05] You can do it, but it is hard to continue that consistency.
[00:10:09] So I can brainstorm with you,
[00:10:10] who is that person who can be a helper?
[00:10:12] Is it a part time person?
[00:10:14] Is it a full time person?
[00:10:15] Is it your assistant doing double duty?
[00:10:18] Figuring out how do we get the repetition piece in there?
[00:10:24] So mindset, skill set repetition.
[00:10:25] I believe this so deeply.
[00:10:26] The more I started thinking about this,
[00:10:28] the more when you really think about anything
[00:10:29] that you have mastered and gotten good at.
[00:10:31] Isn't that it?
[00:10:32] Whether you've run a marathon or become a better cook?
[00:10:36] Mindset, I can do this.
[00:10:37] This is something that's important to me.
[00:10:39] Skill set, I will learn to be a better baker,
[00:10:41] to be a better runner.
[00:10:42] And then repetition, running all the time,
[00:10:44] twice a week, three times a week,
[00:10:45] cooking, all the time, becoming a better cook.
[00:10:48] So I think it's a really important thing to process
[00:10:50] that it's not just one piece.
[00:10:53] It's not just, oh, I'm confident or not confident.
[00:10:54] It's not about that.
[00:10:55] Oh, I know what I'm posting right now.
[00:10:58] It's really all three of those things together.
[00:11:00] So MSR, I would love to see mindset, skill set repetition
[00:11:03] happening for your business.
[00:11:04] Please drop me a line and say hi.
[00:11:06] I absolutely, I'm such a super fan of DJ.
[00:11:08] He's so awesome.
[00:11:09] And I love all of the people that I've met
[00:11:11] listening to this podcast.
[00:11:12] So make sure to drop me a note and say hi.
[00:11:14] And let me know how are you going to put this into place?
[00:11:17] What are you aiming for?
[00:11:19] What are your goals that we can help get MSR,
[00:11:22] mindset, skill set, repetition, to work for you?
[00:11:25] What are your goals going into 2026?
[00:11:27] And if you are going to any of those speeches
[00:11:29] that I've mentioned, like NAR NXT,
[00:11:31] make sure to drop me a note.
[00:11:32] And I would love to say hi when we're there.
[00:11:34] Thanks so much.
[00:11:35] And don't follow me on Instagram, LinkedIn,

I was like, I'm going to show them on video and people are going to come find me. What is that about? But that's true. I have built my business directly through social media. When I decided I was in media, I was an executive and I found myself working during childbirth. I realized I wanted to grow my business, but I quickly realized I was accomplished, but anonymous. I had to leverage video and social media to grow my business. That is what I'm committed to helping with agents. I love helping agents around the country really truly grow your business through video. Number one is that mindset shift. I know a lot of people say, I'm not really scared to be on video. I'm like, okay, then why aren't you doing it? Once we're through that mindset shift of, okay, it's important to be on video. Then when we're getting on video, I got to be honest. Ever since I was out of their own voice. That's okay. We actually scientifically hear our voice differently than other people. So it's okay to say, I don't love me on video, but it's something I'm going to grow into. So the mindset piece is that is really owning that you can be on camera. You can be good on camera. It's not an in-ate talent. It is something that you can build and also that it is an important part of your business. So once you're really harnessing that and you're saying, okay, I'm going to do this. Then shifting into the skill set mode. Now you're bought in, you want to do it. You actually have to build the skills to be a better speaker, content creator, and really build out your team who's going to be making this content. You can't have one or the other. So the mindset is necessary and so is the skill set. So skill set looks like, I, you know, you can message me and grab my free tips at camera.com slash RE tips. I can grab you my free tips on five videos that get clients for agents that five videos you absolutely must make and how to use AI to make better videos. But when we're talking about skill set, it is really understanding how, how do you show up confidently on camera? Those are scientific methods. How do you actually get better on camera? And there's also the strategy piece, right? Even if you feel good, you feel confident, you actually need a strategy, right? You need people to understand who you are, what you're about and what makes you unique. So that's the mindset. Then we're talking about the skill set and the final piece that people often don't really hit and you really need all three of these to be successful. Mindset, skill set, repetition. You cannot go to the gym once, come home and say, where is my six pack? You really need to repeat that action. It is the same with video. It is the same with anything. Believing it's important than learning the skills to do it. If you don't implement consistently, you're not gonna see that benefit. And what does that look like? So I have some clients and I like to say to people, I say with my clients, my agents, I say, I don't spend your money, right? You decide what budget you're on and I'll help you get there no matter your budget. So if you're kind of DIY, you're doing it yourself, you're trying to do it without a big budget, that means holding your feet to the fire. Really strong time management. If you've been assistant in listing their help, maybe they're not editing your videos, maybe they are, but having them keep you in line and making that content consistently. Next, if you have a bigger team, it is super important to really, really get your strategy locked up. I am a video coach, I am a former executive producer in TV. I speak all over the country. I cannot tell you how important it is to actually have a strategy. Showing up is good. It helps you build that connection with people. You need a strategy that involves credibility and connection. You need to make people trust you. You need to make people like you. You cannot just start showing up and start throwing spaghetti at the wall. It's really important to go in with a strategy. Drop me a line, we'll connect. I'll give you some ideas. But when we're talking about the repetition piece, it doesn't matter if you're doing it on a shissering budget or doing it on a large budget, maybe over a big team. I can help you figure out who is that person? Who are those people? Who can help keep it up? So my clients, my most successful clients, truly, I've worked with them. They did my video boot camp coaching program. And then I've been supporting them in a low touch way for a while. They have people helping them. They do some of it themselves and they do some of it with other people. It is hard to do it totally by yourself. You can do it, but it is hard to continue that consistency. So I can brainstorm with you, who is that person who can be a helper? Is it a part time person? Is it a full time person? Is it your assistant doing double duty? Figuring out how do we get the repetition piece in there? So mindset, skill set repetition. I believe this so deeply. The more I started thinking about this, the more when you really think about anything that you have mastered and gotten good at. Isn't that it? Whether you've run a marathon or become a better cook? Mindset, I can do this. This is something that's important to me. Skill set, I will learn to be a better baker, to be a better runner. And then repetition, running all the time, twice a week, three times a week, cooking, all the time, becoming a better cook. So I think it's a really important thing to process that it's not just one piece. It's not just, oh, I'm confident or not confident. It's not about that. Oh, I know what I'm posting right now. It's really all three of those things together. So MSR, I would love to see mindset, skill set repetition happening for your business. Please drop me a line and say hi.
