[00:02:19] Okay, enough of that.
[00:02:20] Let's get to the main event.
[00:02:22] My conversation was Shayla Twitt.
[00:02:24] ["Snow Tower"]
[00:02:36] Okay, today on the show, our guest is Shayla Twitt.
[00:02:39] She's a luxury agent with Cold Wall Banker
[00:02:42] in Sarasota, Florida.
[00:02:44] Let me tell you more about Shayla.
[00:02:46] Now, Shayla has been selling real estate in sunny Sarasota,
[00:02:50] Florida since 2002, specializing in luxury
[00:02:54] and waterfront real estate in the Sarasota man,
[00:02:58] manatee and Charlotte County areas.
[00:03:00] She prides herself on her high touch
[00:03:03] and artfully curated concierge style.
[00:03:06] Originally from Steven's point Wisconsin,
[00:03:09] she also hails from UWSP with a business and a French degrees.
[00:03:15] She comes from a large family,
[00:03:17] many of which are entrepreneurs as well.
[00:03:19] With her extra time, she will either be in the gym,
[00:03:23] playing with her two dogs or cat
[00:03:25] or quite possibly volunteering with the fabulous team
[00:03:28] at the Humane Society at the Lakewood Ranch.
[00:03:31] To learn all things, Shayla, please visit her website
[00:03:37] sarasotarealestatesold.com.
[00:03:38] Let me say that again.
[00:03:41] Sarasotarealestatesold.com will have links to that
[00:03:43] in the show notes.
[00:03:45] Welcome, Shayla, welcome.
[00:03:47] I thank you so much.
[00:03:48] Say to talk to you, DJ.
[00:03:50] I'm excited to talk to you as well.
[00:03:54] We were, Shayla and I were talking just before the show
[00:03:57] about I love Sarasota.
[00:03:59] So I am so excited.
[00:04:01] In my mind, I'm sitting next to you,
[00:04:04] soaking up some of the warm of Florida right now.
[00:04:09] It is currently 11 degrees.
[00:04:12] No, I'm sorry, it is.
[00:04:13] Yes, it does 11 degrees here in Chicago.
[00:04:15] It is sunny, but very, very cold.
[00:04:18] So I appreciate you're probably having a warmer day than me.
[00:04:23] I'll try to bring some warmth your way.
[00:04:26] Shall we say, huh?
[00:04:27] Love it.
[00:04:30] You've really done some super impressive things.
[00:04:33] I always like to start at the beginning of the journey
[00:04:37] because so many of our audience really wants to know
[00:04:41] how you got started and then how you continued
[00:04:44] to evolve throughout your business.
[00:04:46] So how did you get into real estate?
[00:04:48] Well, I went, I didn't go to college to become a REALTOR.
[00:04:53] I went and I got my business degree
[00:04:55] and I came down to Sarasota home of the Ringling Circus.
[00:05:00] Yeah.
[00:05:00] That's a circus, all right.
[00:05:02] And my younger brother was here.
[00:05:05] I never knew anything about Sarasota
[00:05:06] and my younger brother who was going to Ringling Arts,
[00:05:09] which is a really prestigious arts school, by the way.
[00:05:12] Yeah.
[00:05:13] We didn't know anything about it.
[00:05:14] I didn't know anything about it only because my brother was here.
[00:05:17] And so he landed here.
[00:05:18] I came down right after college
[00:05:20] and because nothing was really kind of working out that calm.
[00:05:23] We used to apply for any jobs, you know?
[00:05:26] Sure.
[00:05:26] And nothing was exciting me anyway.
[00:05:29] And so I just, I had never been to Sarasota.
[00:05:31] I packed up my 19-in-one Red Olds Mobile.
[00:05:35] Okay, I don't even know how she made it all down here now.
[00:05:38] But I came, I moved right in with him,
[00:05:41] which was so nice to have a place
[00:05:43] in the upcourse with my brother.
[00:05:44] And moved to with him.
[00:05:46] And within the first six months,
[00:05:48] I kind of was figuring my life out.
[00:05:50] I got a little job at Outback, waiting tables.
[00:05:53] God knows I didn't go to school for that.
[00:05:56] But it was an interim job.
[00:05:58] And everywhere we went,
[00:06:00] everybody, the whole conversation evolved around real estate.
[00:06:04] And so I just thought like,
[00:06:07] I think I would do well at it.
[00:06:08] I would enjoy it and excel and just have fun with it.
[00:06:13] So I ended up just getting in and right away
[00:06:16] within the first six months of living here.
[00:06:19] Wow, that is quite a jump.
[00:06:22] And also too, Florida has the most number
[00:06:26] of REALTORS per capita of any state.
[00:06:30] So there's tremendous competition out there.
[00:06:33] I think I read somewhere as of, I think 2020,
[00:06:36] there were 195,000 in the state,
[00:06:38] which is insane.
[00:06:41] It's insane.
[00:06:42] It is.
[00:06:43] It is like, I think it was something like
[00:06:45] every fifth person in Florida has their real estate license.
[00:06:49] There's something it's something crazy like that.
[00:06:51] You know, that's going to change your coming up now.
[00:06:54] But I think a lot of that too is the people that are part time
[00:06:58] where they just do it here and there or sell to family.
[00:07:01] So we've got a lot of those.
[00:07:02] And then it's like, you have that population
[00:07:04] and then you have the population that actually makes a living.
[00:07:08] And then you have the top one for centers.
[00:07:10] I mean, there's other categories in between,
[00:07:12] but just to generalize.
[00:07:15] Yeah, no, I think you're right.
[00:07:17] We're starting to see here in Chicago,
[00:07:20] a mass exodus of the agents who are the ones Z2Z,
[00:07:25] do a couple deals a year.
[00:07:27] We're starting to see them exit the industry,
[00:07:29] which should be, I think, good news for a lot of our listeners.
[00:07:37] It's also good news for us because we have a holding company.
[00:07:39] So those agents transfer over into a holding company
[00:07:42] a lot of times to keep their license active.
[00:07:44] But the bottom line is they're people leaving the industry.
[00:07:47] And I think that will actually be beneficial to existing agents
[00:07:53] who are more full time or are really wanting to step
[00:07:57] on the gas in their business.
[00:07:59] Are you seeing that trend as well?
[00:08:03] I'm feeling it.
[00:08:04] I feel like it's right now as we sit here
[00:08:07] and we're recording this early February.
[00:08:09] So it's dated, but 2023.
[00:08:13] But it's kind of an interim time right now, I feel like.
[00:08:17] So the showings are down even for me.
[00:08:20] And I've got some listings.
[00:08:23] And so I can only imagine for a new agent,
[00:08:26] they're probably feeling that exponentially.
[00:08:29] And so you can't help but think that that's going to ultimately
[00:08:33] affect them financially.
[00:08:34] And I'm feeling the buzz around our office even.
[00:08:40] And we are in a top office.
[00:08:41] We do have some new agents there.
[00:08:43] And the buzz around the community,
[00:08:45] because I have a big, I keep my hand in the pulse
[00:08:48] within the community and my colleagues
[00:08:51] and just the talk about town.
[00:08:53] And there's only so much business to go around.
[00:08:56] And I think with agents exiting, exodusing,
[00:09:00] however you want to put it,
[00:09:02] that the cream will rise to the top
[00:09:04] and that sellers, if they're smart,
[00:09:07] knowing that their properties will take longer in the market.
[00:09:09] Now they're going to want the full service agents.
[00:09:11] Now they're going to want the full marketing package,
[00:09:13] marketing, advertising matter.
[00:09:16] And so if we don't have that experience,
[00:09:17] especially if you're new in the last two years,
[00:09:19] you don't know what you don't know.
[00:09:22] Yeah, I think you just said a lot of really great things.
[00:09:26] I think you're right.
[00:09:27] Now is the time to, if you are,
[00:09:31] if any of our listeners out there are wanting to really
[00:09:37] attract more sellers,
[00:09:37] this is the year to get your marketing packets,
[00:09:41] your listing presentations on point.
[00:09:44] There's a ton of services that can help you do this,
[00:09:48] but realize that right now, of course, listings are,
[00:09:53] there's a lot of competition for listings.
[00:09:54] So if you are going up against other teams,
[00:09:57] well, first of all, maybe consider joining the team, right?
[00:10:00] So if you want to be a big player in your local market,
[00:10:07] find out who the teams are that are capturing this business
[00:10:10] and take a look and see what are their marketing materials look like.
[00:10:15] What are those two presentations?
[00:10:17] If they're willing to share that with you, that's gold.
[00:10:19] I mean, if I were a new agent,
[00:10:21] I would seek out someone that's been in the business
[00:10:22] a long time that is a top agent and mentor with that person.
[00:10:27] They're willing to do that.
[00:10:28] That is absolutely priceless.
[00:10:30] You're not reinventing the wheel here.
[00:10:32] I'm not reinventing the wheel.
[00:10:33] I'm just doing what works for me as other agents do.
[00:10:36] And what works for me might not work for the other person,
[00:10:39] but I do think that honing in on your value proposition
[00:10:43] and really fine tuning it outlining it
[00:10:46] outlining that for your sellers important.
[00:10:48] I go in every single year and I revamp.
[00:10:50] I find to my marketing links that I send out as a prepackage
[00:10:55] to my sellers.
[00:10:56] I revamped that this year because I was like,
[00:10:58] I really want to express to sellers
[00:11:01] like all of the unique curated services that we offer
[00:11:05] each and every seller.
[00:11:07] I can't drive that home enough because sometimes I get stuck
[00:11:10] when someone says, well, how are you different?
[00:11:13] Why would I hire you?
[00:11:14] And it's like, I sometimes get stuck in the moment.
[00:11:16] So if you haven't already outlined in a format,
[00:11:19] it's so much better.
[00:11:22] You know, that is a really, really easily glossed over thing
[00:11:27] that I don't want to gloss over because really,
[00:11:31] having a list of services that you provide to your clients
[00:11:36] is critical because there are going to be
[00:11:40] those elevator kind of conversations where you only have,
[00:11:44] you know, maybe they're in-person conversations
[00:11:46] where someone's like, hey, so how are you different
[00:11:48] from every other REALTOR in town?
[00:11:50] You need to have three or four things that you say
[00:11:53] that you do ready to answer that question
[00:11:56] because let's face it, the other groups or teams
[00:12:01] or big producers in your local market
[00:12:03] have answers to those questions.
[00:12:05] Why should they trust you versus X?
[00:12:08] And it's not, of course, to ever disparage anyone
[00:12:11] who you're in competition with,
[00:12:14] but to sort of separate and elevate yourself.
[00:12:17] And so you do need to know your value proposition.
[00:12:19] I think that is such great advice.
[00:12:22] And it sort of goes back to like when I first left college
[00:12:25] and had my first job where they said,
[00:12:28] practice your objection handling,
[00:12:31] practice your value proposition,
[00:12:33] your elevator pitch in the mirror.
[00:12:35] I mean, it sounds silly,
[00:12:37] but you really should have three or four things
[00:12:41] or I'm asking, or I should I should I ask you,
[00:12:44] there should always be some information
[00:12:46] that you're able to provide about what's going on
[00:12:49] in the industry to talk when you meet people.
[00:12:54] Is that great?
[00:12:54] Yeah.
[00:12:55] I would say yes, absolutely.
[00:12:58] And when I look back at like my older value propositions,
[00:13:02] I was a little, I was two centered on me
[00:13:04] and it was more about me.
[00:13:06] And I'm like, this is not about me, how great I am.
[00:13:10] I think agents spent REALTOR, especially,
[00:13:13] I don't know if we're two ego centric or something like that.
[00:13:16] The ego is good, but to a point, right?
[00:13:18] You have to have ego and empathy,
[00:13:20] empathy for the other person's situation.
[00:13:23] So I totally switched that around and I made sure
[00:13:26] and I was very hyper focused on the fact that like,
[00:13:30] I'm curating first impressions for you
[00:13:33] and that's how we start the value proposition.
[00:13:35] Like everything I do is like an art,
[00:13:37] like you know, when you go and you make a painting
[00:13:40] and you start the painting, you step away from it
[00:13:44] and then you come back with new ideas.
[00:13:46] So you take your time and make sure that
[00:13:50] from the wording to the photography
[00:13:52] and the entire package presentation is really thoughtful
[00:13:58] and made for that person and for that property
[00:14:01] because everybody, everybody's property is as unique as them.
[00:14:05] And so we take so much time and care into just the remarks
[00:14:10] that we put out, they're really thoughtful.
[00:14:14] So we start from there and kind of move our way
[00:14:16] through like the presentation.
[00:14:18] Yeah, I love that.
[00:14:19] I think every home has a story, right?
[00:14:22] And every home should be able to have that story be told
[00:14:28] and really good REALTORS are able to do that.
[00:14:32] They're able to identify certain characteristics of a home
[00:14:36] or a personality type of a home sometimes even
[00:14:40] and really highlight and focus that.
[00:14:42] And that should all be coupled with the team
[00:14:47] or the individual agent's branding.
[00:14:50] So we really encourage everyone to think about
[00:14:55] this is the year to level up your sort of brand.
[00:15:03] And your brand.
[00:15:04] Yeah, you know how you want to portray your clients
[00:15:07] and their properties like you want to stand out
[00:15:10] like instead of saying like you know,
[00:15:13] pointing out the obvious in the remarks, like panel lifestyle,
[00:15:16] you want people to imagine someone in that home
[00:15:21] and having to walk glass of wine at the rooftop
[00:15:23] or whatever the attributes of the home
[00:15:26] you would have really highlighted the most
[00:15:28] and not cover up the objections
[00:15:31] but almost address them in a way that's more artful
[00:15:35] that you're not hiding something.
[00:15:38] Like if it's on a busy road, make it to a benefit.
[00:15:41] You know what I mean?
[00:15:41] So that you're not, you know, people aren't getting there
[00:15:45] and saying like, oh, there's a railroad track in the back
[00:15:47] but like you've already addressed it in a way
[00:15:50] that's creative to where, okay, they're showing it
[00:15:53] or they're coming to see this.
[00:15:55] This is probably a better quality showing
[00:15:57] because they kind of already know a lot of that stuff, you know.
[00:16:00] There is a marketing principle that I learned many, many, many years ago
[00:16:05] called if you can't fix it, feature it
[00:16:08] which basically means that, yeah, give all the information up front
[00:16:16] and so that when the person arrives there, you know,
[00:16:20] they're fully aware of what the situation,
[00:16:22] what the property has and doesn't have.
[00:16:24] I want to talk about leads
[00:16:28] because everybody, of course, this REALTOR businesses
[00:16:35] are contingent upon lead generation
[00:16:38] and I would love to know right now we know it's difficult, right?
[00:16:44] We have a higher interest rate environment
[00:16:47] that we then REALTORS would prefer
[00:16:49] for so our lending partners are telling us
[00:16:53] that we might see rates in the fives,
[00:16:56] maybe the low sixes this year for 30 year fixed rates
[00:17:00] that of course is going to have an impact
[00:17:02] on the number of buyers who want to participate.
[00:17:06] So we also know inventory has dramatically shrunk.
[00:17:11] So we have this two difficult challenges this year.
[00:17:16] We have low inventory and higher rates,
[00:17:18] although I think the rates are still pretty reasonable historically
[00:17:21] but what are you doing to keep busy,
[00:17:26] stay productive, stay active and stay positive?
[00:17:30] Well, I learned early on I was lucky
[00:17:32] and I have to be introduced to the Bafini and Company system
[00:17:35] of referrals and repeat, you know, that whole model.
[00:17:39] So I was very, you know, looking back at 20 years
[00:17:42] and still in that company of just getting, you know,
[00:17:45] having access to the backend system,
[00:17:47] which was great and the whole principle is behind it,
[00:17:50] which the definition of real estate is lead generation.
[00:17:53] It is and however, you want to break that down is your question.
[00:17:57] So, you know, for me, I've been doing this now almost 21 years
[00:18:02] so I really have my database
[00:18:04] so I'm careful to stay in touch with them,
[00:18:08] not too much but just enough.
[00:18:10] Like so no, here for me, you know, on a regular basis
[00:18:13] where, you know, they're passively on social media
[00:18:15] but they always get like that of the snail mail
[00:18:19] or an e-news letter every single month.
[00:18:23] And so, you know, seeing in touch with those people
[00:18:25] because if you're a long time agent,
[00:18:28] the biggest thing you can do with what I would suggest
[00:18:30] is go back and source your business
[00:18:34] and keep doing what works and not reinvent the wheel there
[00:18:38] and then figure out, okay, like 75% 80% comes
[00:18:43] from repeat referral for me.
[00:18:45] So, I keep touching those people,
[00:18:47] whether I call text email.
[00:18:50] I will say I started this within the last like nine months
[00:18:54] I want to say and every, I always touch them
[00:18:56] on the anniversary of the sale or purchase.
[00:18:59] Love that.
[00:18:59] So, I'm gonna pause you for a second
[00:19:01] because you were saying so much great stuff
[00:19:04] that I'm gonna slow us down a little
[00:19:08] because you're talking about home anniversary
[00:19:12] or we'll call it home sales transaction anniversary date.
[00:19:18] So, by the way, nobody knows their home anniversary date
[00:19:22] other than the real thing.
[00:19:24] This is a great opportunity to basically create
[00:19:27] a birthday event for the property.
[00:19:31] And make an excuse to reach out.
[00:19:32] So, I took it a step further
[00:19:34] because I wanted it to be more personal
[00:19:36] that this isn't a group email.
[00:19:39] Anybody can send a text.
[00:19:41] So, I made time in my calendar
[00:19:43] and you carve it out however you can
[00:19:45] and you can stack them
[00:19:46] but you go to the person's house or to the gate
[00:19:49] or however far you can get to the neighborhood
[00:19:51] or the clubhouse, whatever.
[00:19:53] It's far into the house as you can get
[00:19:56] and I do a personal video and I text it to them.
[00:19:59] And then I say in the video I say,
[00:20:01] happy anniversary, you bought the house, blah blah.
[00:20:05] And I just wanna see how the family is doing.
[00:20:07] Yeah, you know, whatever the message is.
[00:20:09] And then at the end of it I'll say,
[00:20:11] like I'm gonna follow up and send you your equity update
[00:20:13] in an email today so you get your annual equity update.
[00:20:16] It's hand selected, hand curated for you.
[00:20:20] And I've gotten so many good responses from that.
[00:20:23] Like it's part-worn.
[00:20:24] I mean, yeah, because I'm like,
[00:20:26] I get excited to do that for them
[00:20:28] and then I'm like, I can't wait for them to see it respond,
[00:20:31] you know?
[00:20:32] So it's fun.
[00:20:33] And what you're saying is simple
[00:20:36] and yet super brilliant in a way
[00:20:38] because it really solves a couple of problems.
[00:20:43] One is, okay, I'm not so busy right now
[00:20:46] because rates in the market and you know,
[00:20:49] I'm not as busy.
[00:20:50] What I could always do is do annual anniversary check-ins
[00:20:56] with my past clients or any,
[00:21:00] it doesn't even have to be a past client.
[00:21:01] It could be literally anyone who owns a property.
[00:21:04] You could just say, hey, you know,
[00:21:06] because I know as a homeowner,
[00:21:08] the thing that I would always be interested
[00:21:12] in hearing about is what's my,
[00:21:14] what's the property work, right?
[00:21:16] Yeah.
[00:21:17] So the idea of being able to send that to somebody
[00:21:22] on an annual basis, like, hey, I just,
[00:21:24] you know, did a little quick thing here for you.
[00:21:27] That is incredibly valuable to people,
[00:21:30] whether they want to move or not.
[00:21:32] And they remember that and you know,
[00:21:34] you can take that same formula and spin it however you want
[00:21:37] and whether they are just a friend
[00:21:40] and you can look up in the tax record and say,
[00:21:42] hey, I saw that you buy your house,
[00:21:43] whatever years ago, I just thought I'd send you
[00:21:46] an equity, it doesn't have to be a client.
[00:21:48] So if you're new and you're looking to get business,
[00:21:51] it's something to think about too.
[00:21:53] Like, you don't always have to be an agent of years
[00:21:55] and years and years.
[00:21:56] I mean, I started somewhere.
[00:21:57] I don't know what the hell I was doing, you know?
[00:21:59] All these things that you've developed over time,
[00:22:02] they just, they just become systems.
[00:22:04] And that's the other thing, you have to develop systems
[00:22:07] and consistency and just put the things in your schedule
[00:22:12] and do like, I'm a big fan of recurring tasks.
[00:22:16] So you do them every so whatever, so it pops up.
[00:22:18] This is what I have to do today.
[00:22:20] So you're not like, you know what you're gonna do
[00:22:21] in the calendar, it's already organized.
[00:22:24] Yeah, I think this is, it's so funny.
[00:22:29] So we're here in Chicago.
[00:22:31] There's 47,000 REALTORS in our market here.
[00:22:35] I can count on one hand.
[00:22:38] The number, so I moved into a place, new construction
[00:22:42] two years ago.
[00:22:44] I can count on one hand the number of mailers I've received,
[00:22:48] not that mailers are the, and all be y'all,
[00:22:51] but if anyone, by the way,
[00:22:54] Chicago, one of the most aggressive competitive
[00:22:58] real estate markets in the country,
[00:23:01] you would, and I live in a new development in the city,
[00:23:04] you would think that even though I just purchased a property,
[00:23:09] REALTORS would be consistently.
[00:23:11] Bombarding.
[00:23:13] Bombarding me with, hey, here's what your home is worth.
[00:23:16] Here's what your place is worth.
[00:23:17] Here's what the neighborhood's worth.
[00:23:18] Here, are you thinking of moving?
[00:23:21] I've got maybe one or two letters and two years.
[00:23:26] So this is a huge opportunity.
[00:23:27] And again, understanding that mailers aren't necessarily
[00:23:31] I do.
[00:23:32] Yeah.
[00:23:34] There's a huge opportunity out here to introduce yourself
[00:23:37] to people because every homeowner is not every homeowner,
[00:23:42] but most homeowners want to know what their home property
[00:23:44] value is worth, right?
[00:23:46] And they're going to go to Zillow.
[00:23:47] They're going to look up their zest limit
[00:23:49] because that's what people do.
[00:23:51] And then you're going to come in and say,
[00:23:52] you know, actually, I think Zillow's got it pretty close to right,
[00:23:55] but here's what I actually think your home is worth based
[00:23:57] on my own research.
[00:24:00] That you could do that all day long every day, right?
[00:24:03] Oh, yeah.
[00:24:05] Absolutely.
[00:24:06] And so to your point, I've been doing the mailers.
[00:24:11] So I think it's a market to market thing.
[00:24:14] I don't know.
[00:24:14] Mailers might not be for every market.
[00:24:16] I do feel like that's probably the case.
[00:24:20] I will say for me in my market, I do a lot on Longboat Key,
[00:24:24] which is just North East, yes, to Key in Sarasota.
[00:24:28] And it's actually spans Sarasota, Manasi County, nine miles.
[00:24:32] But so they are the demographics that are on Longboat,
[00:24:36] many snowbirds, lots of people that aren't even here.
[00:24:39] They're probably up in Chicago, you know, when it's cold.
[00:24:42] And so they are getting my mailers.
[00:24:44] And in the mailer, they get the listings,
[00:24:47] they get the QR codes of all the recent YouTube videos
[00:24:51] I've done and then on the back and some other things.
[00:24:54] And on the back, it's got all of the market stats
[00:24:57] for their neighborhood or what's transpired.
[00:25:00] So they're getting all that every single month
[00:25:04] without question.
[00:25:06] And so that's a regular, that's another system
[00:25:08] that we do to keep it tough.
[00:25:10] I love that.
[00:25:11] Yeah, so in between sales, you're touching each one of your contacts
[00:25:19] monthly or maybe even more often than that.
[00:25:22] How critical is having those structures in place
[00:25:27] so that people don't forget that you're their REALTOR, right?
[00:25:32] It's really important because you never know
[00:25:35] where the business is going to come from.
[00:25:37] Even though I've say or another agent says,
[00:25:40] I'll repeat referral, but at the end of the day,
[00:25:43] they remember you because you're sending stuff out
[00:25:46] and on a regular basis.
[00:25:48] And so I reach them even more than that
[00:25:51] because I do a YouTube channel too.
[00:25:54] And so I post on Tuesdays and Thursdays
[00:25:56] on my YouTube channel in addition to those
[00:25:59] among other advertising things that we do.
[00:26:02] And the YouTube channel, which goes into my mailer
[00:26:05] and it goes into my eNewsletter every single month.
[00:26:08] And what we do is we talk to area businesses.
[00:26:12] We do an end of the month market update in great detail.
[00:26:16] We tour restaurants.
[00:26:18] We give a lot of people really the neighborhood tours
[00:26:21] because it's like, okay, you can show a house
[00:26:24] and it's like to get the feel of the neighborhood.
[00:26:28] We take a step further.
[00:26:30] So for example, if I take a new listing,
[00:26:33] I do that home tour on the YouTube
[00:26:35] and then we do a whole neighborhood tour.
[00:26:38] And so our sellers love that too.
[00:26:40] And it's something that we have fun with
[00:26:42] and that we share with the public.
[00:26:43] And it gets people to understand
[00:26:45] like get to know Sarah Soda and what's here in the lifestyle.
[00:26:50] That is really quite smart because of course,
[00:26:55] when people move anywhere,
[00:26:58] they want to know what is the culture like,
[00:27:00] what's the lifestyle.
[00:27:02] And if as agents, it's so interesting
[00:27:06] you're mentioning this.
[00:27:07] I've definitely had on guests before
[00:27:11] who've talked about creating content, video content,
[00:27:15] specifically around different restaurants
[00:27:18] and retail shops and other community focused content
[00:27:24] to support the local industry, local industries.
[00:27:28] But this idea of doing it with,
[00:27:33] doing it so deliberately is really, really important, I think.
[00:27:38] And I love the fact that you're doing
[00:27:40] this regular video content about lifestyle.
[00:27:44] Like, hey, here's what it's like
[00:27:45] to actually live in this area.
[00:27:48] That is not necessarily real estate specific content,
[00:27:53] but it's incredibly important and valuable,
[00:27:57] along with schooling as well, community,
[00:28:02] different opportunities that exist.
[00:28:04] So how important are those sort of lifestyle markers?
[00:28:12] How important is that to help bring in clients for you?
[00:28:18] Well, it's been really a learning curve process.
[00:28:22] I will say that it is a marathon,
[00:28:25] not a sprint, that you two, I think,
[00:28:28] I think if you're not doing video,
[00:28:30] you're missing a whole channel pun intended
[00:28:34] of ways to get people to know who you are
[00:28:38] and to give us this.
[00:28:40] If you're just gonna do one or two videos,
[00:28:41] don't even do video, that's just my hardcore opinion on it
[00:28:45] because it's like you and everybody else stops.
[00:28:48] So if you're gonna do it, even once a week or every two weeks,
[00:28:52] like stick to a schedule,
[00:28:55] I'm starting to get more interaction with it.
[00:28:58] Now, I'm not up to even 500 subscribers yet,
[00:29:01] but it's been, it's a challenging platform, I'll say that,
[00:29:06] to grow.
[00:29:09] But it's been fun.
[00:29:10] I think that people are now calling and saying,
[00:29:14] oh my gosh, I'm sorry, YouTube,
[00:29:16] where they might have seen me,
[00:29:17] they might have Google me first or Google chair sort of
[00:29:20] REALTORS, you know, and then they stumble on me
[00:29:23] and then they see my YouTube goes to my website
[00:29:26] and it auto uploads on my website too.
[00:29:28] So that's why you gotta do so many things to be found,
[00:29:34] unless someone already knows about you.
[00:29:37] Yeah, so this idea of creating content
[00:29:41] for on social media for the public,
[00:29:46] for your sphere of influence.
[00:29:50] I've had hundreds of guests on the show over the years,
[00:29:54] and they all typically tend to focus on providing content,
[00:30:02] solving problems, I think, is a lot of times what drives content.
[00:30:07] So if you're a REALTOR out there and you're thinking about
[00:30:11] what should I be focused on on social media,
[00:30:14] I always think, you know, just write down
[00:30:17] the most common questions that you're receiving
[00:30:21] from your buyers, your sellers,
[00:30:23] and then start to create content around answering those questions.
[00:30:27] You know, like, and I imagine in Sarasota,
[00:30:31] because when people move, obviously there's just a lot
[00:30:34] of things outside of the house that are factored in.
[00:30:39] I mean, like we think, like so throughout the day,
[00:30:42] like as you have conversations, as problems come up,
[00:30:47] as unique circumstances come up, we just write them down,
[00:30:49] and we're like, oh, that'd be good video, this'd be good video.
[00:30:52] And a lot of the conversations I have are, okay,
[00:30:56] what are the, I want to be walkable to this,
[00:30:58] I have a dog, where are the dog faces?
[00:31:00] And we did a walkability video,
[00:31:02] we've done the dog part video,
[00:31:04] we've done the spa, the restaurants,
[00:31:07] it's not like anybody, like I said,
[00:31:09] anybody can just show a house all the time,
[00:31:11] and then if that works for your page, great, for us,
[00:31:14] I want to mix it up and make it fun.
[00:31:16] And just, again, it's just,
[00:31:18] it's people come here for the lifestyle,
[00:31:19] we have a lot of snowbirds here.
[00:31:22] That's my main market, you know, beachfront,
[00:31:24] canos, and all that stuff, and you know,
[00:31:27] they come and go, and it's been part of the year,
[00:31:29] or half the year, whatever.
[00:31:31] And they want to come here for the lifestyle and the sun,
[00:31:33] and you know, there's other benefits to, of course,
[00:31:36] the no-state tax and all the other stuff.
[00:31:39] Unlike in Chicago, where you're at with all the taxes.
[00:31:43] Sure.
[00:31:45] And so you want to tell them about all those great things
[00:31:49] and learn about the area in that way.
[00:31:52] Yeah, and I'd love, you know, being that you're in a competitive,
[00:31:59] Sarasota Southern Florida area,
[00:32:02] you're in a competitive agent environment here in Chicago,
[00:32:04] we are competitive as well.
[00:32:06] How do you differentiate yourself?
[00:32:08] What are some of the ways in which you sort of stand apart
[00:32:12] from other REALTORS?
[00:32:14] Well, I think, well, one of them is the YouTube channel,
[00:32:17] because I know there's so many just starting
[00:32:20] they completely fall off.
[00:32:21] I mean, they do.
[00:32:22] And it's interesting to watch that happen.
[00:32:25] And I'm happy to, you know, I guess not mentor people,
[00:32:29] or they come in to call me for advice,
[00:32:30] which is flattering, but I'm like, listen,
[00:32:34] this is how it is.
[00:32:34] Like don't even start if you're just not going to commit.
[00:32:37] You know, so I think because I put myself out there so much,
[00:32:41] you know, on social media and the various avenues,
[00:32:45] I did actually get recently approached
[00:32:47] to do a professionally produced series.
[00:32:52] And it's called Inside Luxury Listing Sarasota.
[00:32:55] We actually did a little flip in the studio yesterday.
[00:32:59] And so it's going to be really starting to be released in March.
[00:33:01] And again, that's something very different
[00:33:05] because it's collaborating with other agents in town,
[00:33:07] showcasing luxury properties that people couldn't get into
[00:33:11] otherwise unless they were on this show.
[00:33:15] And we're just doing a different spin on it.
[00:33:17] And by me collaborating with, I mean, I was asked,
[00:33:21] it was very generous offered to be asked to be on this.
[00:33:25] But now with SEO, I can tag him and her and they can tag me.
[00:33:30] And it's just like, it's going to be mutually beneficial.
[00:33:33] So it's not like, we don't look at that as competition.
[00:33:37] You know, we look at that as like, there's enough business
[00:33:39] for everybody.
[00:33:40] And by us coming together to give a different dynamic
[00:33:44] is just something really unique and fun and exciting.
[00:33:47] Yeah, I think agents can really partner up
[00:33:51] and do these things themselves.
[00:33:54] I, you know, even agents at different offices
[00:33:58] can really partner up and, you know, work together.
[00:34:02] Work together.
[00:34:03] It is called a cooperative commission.
[00:34:05] Let's not forget that.
[00:34:07] And yeah, there's so much opportunity out there.
[00:34:13] People have to live somewhere, right?
[00:34:15] And so, you know, I'm curious, what are you doing?
[00:34:22] Or what are you doing to help right now agents
[00:34:28] are struggling, interest rates, low inventory, buyers
[00:34:33] are in shorter supply than before when we were at 3% rates.
[00:34:39] So how are you staying active, busy?
[00:34:42] What are you doing to, you know, keep your business
[00:34:45] rolling forward?
[00:34:47] Well, I'm listening to, basically from the time I get up
[00:34:51] in the morning, I'm listening to positive content,
[00:34:54] like your channel here and others,
[00:34:57] just really positive mindset, real estate,
[00:35:02] millionaire, billionaire mindset, just positive
[00:35:07] and positive out motivational.
[00:35:10] I have routines, I think routines are really impactful
[00:35:14] and important in the discipline behind that
[00:35:16] because you can be motivated not discipline.
[00:35:19] So I feel crazy, I get up before, I get up before every morning
[00:35:23] and I get to the gym because the days I don't work out,
[00:35:28] I just have anxiety, I just feel off.
[00:35:30] So once I get that workout in,
[00:35:32] I'm so much more motivated to tackle the day
[00:35:36] and get things done.
[00:35:38] And I think that those little rituals that you do,
[00:35:41] whether it's journaling or meditating
[00:35:43] or getting up and working out or like playing with your dogs
[00:35:46] or what if you're going for a walk to start the day,
[00:35:50] I think is immensely beneficial for people
[00:35:54] if they just start and then they stick with it.
[00:35:57] Yeah, you know, I think the last five episodes I've done
[00:36:02] of people, interviews have been with all about Miracle Morning.
[00:36:10] So the Miracle Morning is a very common popular sort of practice
[00:36:15] in the sort of self-improvement world
[00:36:18] and having habits, disciplines are really kind of the keys
[00:36:23] to success.
[00:36:25] And so in this book, Miracle Morning,
[00:36:26] they talk about your physical health,
[00:36:29] your spiritual health, your basically setting yourself up
[00:36:33] for success early in the morning.
[00:36:36] So it's business, physical, personal, et cetera.
[00:36:41] So yeah, I'm a huge, huge fan of that.
[00:36:43] I imagine that book probably had a significant impact
[00:36:46] on you as well.
[00:36:49] So I guess maybe what I would be interested in
[00:36:54] is what your, from a customer perspective,
[00:37:03] what do you think is helping you separate
[00:37:10] yourself from the other agents in your area?
[00:37:12] What else are you doing aside from the CMAs?
[00:37:16] I think that, well, especially when I'm working
[00:37:19] with a buyer or a seller, communication is my reputation.
[00:37:25] So what I mean by that is, for example,
[00:37:28] I just took a listing a week ago today
[00:37:30] and it's different market now.
[00:37:33] We got to change things up here.
[00:37:35] So, and I'm reverting back to my old little habits
[00:37:38] that I did because over the last two years,
[00:37:40] you didn't have to do all this.
[00:37:41] And that way, one of them is, okay,
[00:37:43] it's been a week on the market.
[00:37:45] This is all, this is everything that we've done.
[00:37:48] All the marketing we're doing in Brokers Open,
[00:37:52] called the, you know, Cold Call, the Yadiata.
[00:37:57] And so it's all right there.
[00:37:58] And I like to do that before they can ask
[00:38:01] because when they ask, it's like,
[00:38:04] when the seller's saying, well, what have you been doing?
[00:38:07] It's like, you know, I want to be in that position.
[00:38:09] So I want to tackle it.
[00:38:11] I want to answer the questions before they even have the question.
[00:38:14] That's my approach.
[00:38:15] And we also do a 30 day, and I don't know beyond that,
[00:38:19] you know, we'll still do it if we have to do a 60, 90 day.
[00:38:23] But do that before they ask the question
[00:38:26] because it'll go a long way, not only just with putting them at ease,
[00:38:31] but also it will help if you need a price reduction
[00:38:34] because my seller's already thinking, sure, you said,
[00:38:37] okay, it's been slow.
[00:38:39] I think we've raised a little too high.
[00:38:41] Let them come up with it first.
[00:38:43] It's brilliant.
[00:38:44] Yeah, you know, it's funny.
[00:38:48] My boss, when he started our company here at Kale,
[00:38:52] I said, what, asked him,
[00:38:55] what was your goal, Nick, as a broker owner of a company
[00:38:59] and with your clients?
[00:39:01] He said, he only had one goal, which was,
[00:39:04] he never wanted his client to have to call him first.
[00:39:08] So I never wanted a client to have to call me first.
[00:39:11] I, so basically, you just said essentially the same thing.
[00:39:15] So you'll be ape.
[00:39:17] So this idea of reaching out and proactively,
[00:39:22] having communication with your clients,
[00:39:24] here's what's happening or here's what's not happening.
[00:39:27] Here's why, here's what, the what,
[00:39:30] why, you know, the, the, how, why, what, where, why, how, right?
[00:39:35] Like all just basically explaining, here's where we're at,
[00:39:39] here's what's happening and here's where we're going to move forward.
[00:39:43] And basically, and basically,
[00:39:45] doing what you said you were going to do
[00:39:47] based on the listing presentation or the marketing link
[00:39:50] or how we produce that or give that to him.
[00:39:54] This is everything we said we were going to do
[00:39:56] to this juncture and like, you know, that, that's your word
[00:40:00] and you're following during your word and you're being proactive,
[00:40:04] not reactive, sure.
[00:40:06] Yeah, yeah.
[00:40:07] So when, when listings stay on the market,
[00:40:10] and for longer, longer periods of time,
[00:40:14] of course, then that becomes, they become vulnerable
[00:40:18] to possibly losing those listings.
[00:40:20] And so this, this is a great opportunity.
[00:40:23] Guys, you really need to have a strategy
[00:40:26] so that, you know, communication policy,
[00:40:29] so that at a particular time,
[00:40:32] whether it's, you know, seven days, 14 days, 30 days,
[00:40:37] that you know that that that that that person is going to receive,
[00:40:40] the seller is going to receive information
[00:40:43] about how many eyeballs have, have checked out the property online,
[00:40:48] how many people have scheduled appointments,
[00:40:50] and then you can use that data to say, you know,
[00:40:52] based on other comps in the area,
[00:40:56] I'm not seeing as much interest in this property
[00:40:59] or we're seeing more interest in this property.
[00:41:01] And you can make adjustments from there.
[00:41:03] Is that how you sort of work it?
[00:41:05] Yeah, and, you know, your company might have like the automated,
[00:41:09] you know, they'll get the number of impressions or whatever per week.
[00:41:12] We also have that with cold, bigger, global luxury.
[00:41:14] So that's, that's already built into what they're getting.
[00:41:18] But I don't think that's enough, like, for them to just get an automated
[00:41:22] something, rather, from the company,
[00:41:23] you can think they need to hear from you.
[00:41:26] And another thing you can do,
[00:41:27] because you can get a feel for whether they call the text or email,
[00:41:31] you know, generally you can kind of tell people,
[00:41:33] like, go with that, you know, read between the lines
[00:41:36] and like, if they prefer phone call,
[00:41:38] call them and give them the rundown,
[00:41:42] and do it based on the client and their,
[00:41:45] and their comfort zone too.
[00:41:46] But I think all of these things will show that,
[00:41:49] it shows value.
[00:41:51] And again, you know, people are getting people that are still living in 2020,
[00:41:55] 2020 to market.
[00:41:56] This is going to be really critical in the 2023, you know,
[00:42:00] market coming up for price reduction requests,
[00:42:02] because you've already shown you,
[00:42:04] you're not just sitting around and calling them
[00:42:06] when there's time to reduce the price.
[00:42:08] You've been doing all this work, all this quality,
[00:42:11] and now, okay, we haven't had anything.
[00:42:14] Let's get the price down to sale.
[00:42:15] But, you know,
[00:42:18] yeah, let's talk about marketing.
[00:42:22] I would love to learn a little bit more about how you prospect.
[00:42:28] How do people find you?
[00:42:30] What advice do you have for agents who are,
[00:42:32] maybe they don't have a lot of buyers and sellers right now?
[00:42:36] What would you recommend for them?
[00:42:38] Well, everybody's got a phone.
[00:42:41] Yes or no?
[00:42:42] It's like a little computer that you carry around.
[00:42:44] You have people that you can call.
[00:42:47] I think what I see a lot of new agents doing,
[00:42:50] and it's like so redundant.
[00:42:54] All they do is they say,
[00:42:56] I'm a new agent, calling like a new business.
[00:42:59] I'm available for referrals, buyers and sellers.
[00:43:01] I can do this and that, whatever.
[00:43:04] But I say, like, give them information,
[00:43:08] give them value, give them answers to questions
[00:43:11] before they can get, like put that good content out there.
[00:43:14] It's still about content, right?
[00:43:16] And you can call, you can text them,
[00:43:19] you can email whatever FaceTime,
[00:43:25] and call your database, go out into the community
[00:43:29] and you have a hairdresser,
[00:43:30] go step by with like a little gift
[00:43:33] and just your card or something,
[00:43:34] but that's the Bafini system where they call Popeyes.
[00:43:38] You don't have to do stuff that's expensive,
[00:43:40] like I started out out of college and I need money.
[00:43:42] So you can start with a phone, you can start calling people.
[00:43:44] I didn't know anybody.
[00:43:45] I knew nobody in town.
[00:43:46] My brother's not gonna help me.
[00:43:47] He's in college.
[00:43:48] He's got his college buddies.
[00:43:50] He isn't know anybody.
[00:43:51] So I just started stopping by business.
[00:43:53] I just literally just walked into businesses,
[00:43:56] introduced myself.
[00:43:57] I mean, you gotta be out there.
[00:43:58] You have to, you can call,
[00:44:01] you can get phone numbers now online.
[00:44:03] Like you can just call a neighborhood and say,
[00:44:06] hey, did you know this is happening in your neighborhood?
[00:44:09] Like can I get your email, add them to the database.
[00:44:11] Now they're on a drip.
[00:44:13] Like there's so many things you can do,
[00:44:14] whether you're new or a veteran.
[00:44:16] I, such great advice.
[00:44:20] Adding people to your database is really the key
[00:44:23] and Europe, Bafini person.
[00:44:26] And everybody, we all love the Bafini and Company company.
[00:44:32] And what we want to do is really make sure
[00:44:36] that everybody understands that the most important thing
[00:44:39] for lead generation is adding contacts to your database.
[00:44:44] It just is.
[00:44:45] So if you, and I'm going back about 15 years,
[00:44:50] but Brian, Bafini and Joe Niego,
[00:44:55] they would hold each other accountable
[00:44:57] for meeting a certain number of adding new people
[00:45:00] to their database when they were practicing real estate.
[00:45:03] So they would call each other, say,
[00:45:04] did you meet two to five new people a day?
[00:45:06] That was their goal.
[00:45:07] It was to meet two to five new people every single day
[00:45:10] and add them to your database.
[00:45:12] Because as you know, Shaila,
[00:45:15] that your network is your net worth, right?
[00:45:19] That worth, yes.
[00:45:22] So, so I'm curious.
[00:45:26] So we were talking about staying in touch, right?
[00:45:30] We're talking about providing value,
[00:45:32] staying in touch in between the monoliths of buying and selling.
[00:45:37] So the transactions are the big, you know, big boulders.
[00:45:42] And then we have all these things in between.
[00:45:45] And what we really want to do is provide value
[00:45:47] to the client between those big boulders
[00:45:52] and curious on what types of content
[00:45:55] that you're providing to them so that they, you know,
[00:45:59] you remember that you're a REALTOR
[00:46:01] and that there are in any real estate needs that they can.
[00:46:05] But I'm here, right?
[00:46:07] Yeah.
[00:46:07] Well, you know, just again, from keeping people,
[00:46:11] like it's from, okay, like you can, things to do.
[00:46:15] You can go to the ballet.
[00:46:16] I mean, people are always looking for stuff like that.
[00:46:18] Like so in the e-news letter that we put out,
[00:46:21] there's a little more room than just the piece paper
[00:46:25] that we mail.
[00:46:26] So the e-news letter is a little bit of a spinoff
[00:46:30] of the mailer.
[00:46:31] And in that, there's more fun stuff,
[00:46:33] like fun happenings or like newsworthy things
[00:46:37] of serotonin areas and stuff like that.
[00:46:40] And like the restaurants and the other links
[00:46:42] and just different things like that.
[00:46:45] You know, and outside of that, I have a whole list.
[00:46:52] Yeah, I think which REALTORS who provide guides
[00:46:58] for their local communities.
[00:47:02] These can be incredibly helpful.
[00:47:04] Like this is a silly example, but I was visiting my father
[00:47:08] who was in Puria last week.
[00:47:11] And it's just a weirdest thing to say,
[00:47:14] but in Puria, there's a large Lebanese population
[00:47:17] for whatever reason.
[00:47:19] So I said, hey, dad, let's go to what's the best
[00:47:23] Lebanese restaurant in town, right?
[00:47:26] And so there's tons of them.
[00:47:28] And so we have a lot of them.
[00:47:30] 
[00:47:31] We do.
[00:47:32] Yeah.
[00:47:33] And so I've been eating Lebanese food
[00:47:36] of my entire life because that's where I grew up.
[00:47:39] And I'm curious.
[00:47:40] Yeah.
[00:47:41] So I was like, this is really interesting.
[00:47:43] So as a result, we went online and there's like 20
[00:47:48] different restaurants in Puria, there are Lebanese.
[00:47:51] And so we're like, I don't know which ones.
[00:47:53] But like those are the kind of things that I need to,
[00:47:57] you know, we need to solve that problem.
[00:47:59] And I didn't know which was the best thing.
[00:48:02] And this is where REALTORS can really add value
[00:48:05] and really differentiate themselves outside
[00:48:07] of even just real estate advice itself.
[00:48:11] Yeah.
[00:48:11] You want to be the mayor of Sarasota or mayor of Chicago
[00:48:16] or whatever.
[00:48:16] And I thought that term was funny, but it kind of fit.
[00:48:18] It's not he all stood that to me.
[00:48:20] They're like, hey, the mayor of Sarasota,
[00:48:22] I'm like, well, good.
[00:48:23] It's kind of the goal.
[00:48:24] By the way, I'm half Turkish.
[00:48:26] Are you, are you from the Lebanese?
[00:48:28] No, I'm not.
[00:48:29] I'm not.
[00:48:30] You don't look it.
[00:48:31] No, no, I'm not.
[00:48:33] But the idea is the idea of coming together
[00:48:38] and trying to create value for people
[00:48:43] by solving problems for them.
[00:48:46] So families need to eat.
[00:48:47] Families need to live somewhere.
[00:48:49] So this idea of providing content around those basic needs,
[00:48:54] oftentimes can be really fun and it's as simple
[00:48:58] as really just taking your phone and turning it around
[00:49:01] and turning the camera on and saying, hey, today I'm
[00:49:05] talking about X, Y and Z.
[00:49:07] But promoting locally and, you know,
[00:49:14] a lot of these businesses, the challenge here,
[00:49:17] this is such an opportunity, I think.
[00:49:21] REALTORS really miss out on this.
[00:49:24] So what they don't understand is that
[00:49:27] REALTORS, what REALTORS don't understand
[00:49:30] is that they can reach out to these businesses
[00:49:33] and offer them like, hey, I want to,
[00:49:37] I love your product service, your store,
[00:49:40] and I want to expose my audience to your, you know,
[00:49:44] your wares, your, you know, whatever you're shilling.
[00:49:48] And as a result, I would like you to also, you know,
[00:49:53] possibly, you know, mention me.
[00:49:56] So you're basically giving them free advertising by, you know,
[00:49:59] doing a real or video story about why you like this particular
[00:50:05] vendor in your local community.
[00:50:07] And then you can, from there, go on to create content,
[00:50:12] support of that community and then tag those,
[00:50:16] those, you know, different businesses in there.
[00:50:21] And hopefully drive more engagement.
[00:50:24] This is actually how my channel started.
[00:50:27] So it's funny you say that because I was just going to be doing
[00:50:30] like, logo, not just, but it's kind of started
[00:50:32] into from that, because I've got friends who own businesses
[00:50:36] and I just was like, I want to have you on the channel.
[00:50:38] It benefits me because it's on the channel,
[00:50:40] but really it's promoting you and I hope it drives,
[00:50:43] I hope it drives customers to you.
[00:50:46] And it's been so nice to give back in that way.
[00:50:50] And it's complimentary.
[00:50:51] We don't ask anything in return.
[00:50:52] We just, and we just, so we have one of the video.
[00:50:55] And then we promote the video from these different platforms,
[00:50:58] email, social media, and the mailers.
[00:51:01] So they get hit a few different ways.
[00:51:03] And, you know, we pay for all that advertising, of course.
[00:51:06] And it gives the customer the recipient of the piece of mail
[00:51:09] or email, whatever, something to look at and value.
[00:51:13] And I'm not honey.
[00:51:13] Let's go to this restaurant or let's go check out the
[00:51:16] football game at this bar or something like that.
[00:51:19] And it's cool.
[00:51:20] And actually, so we're coming up on our 300th video
[00:51:24] and we invited everybody that has been a guest,
[00:51:27] thus far, on the channel, to one of the first places I did a
[00:51:32] video at was Rafferty's bar downtown Main Street.
[00:51:36] And so we're going to have it at the bar.
[00:51:37] And we're just going to have like a happy hour.
[00:51:39] And it's we're going to do a little video and pass the
[00:51:41] microphone around.
[00:51:42] And it's just going to be like a big like to do and we'll tag
[00:51:44] everybody and it's just and then they can meet each other in
[00:51:48] exchange cards.
[00:51:49] And it'll be like a little business networking thing on top
[00:51:52] of having this great video.
[00:51:53] And it's just like, it just, it feels really good to do that
[00:51:57] stuff.
[00:51:58] And I didn't, I didn't see it coming, you know, this far,
[00:52:01] like it has and it's just been really enjoyable process.
[00:52:05] Yeah, you basically created a community.
[00:52:08] It sounds like.
[00:52:08] And that's really exciting.
[00:52:10] And people like community, we need it.
[00:52:14] We embrace it.
[00:52:17] And, you know, I always think like every single person always
[00:52:22] is thinking about the weekend, right?
[00:52:24] Like, what am I going to do this weekend?
[00:52:26] What are the events going on?
[00:52:27] What are what are we going to do with my kids?
[00:52:28] What am I going to do with personally?
[00:52:32] And when you have these kind of event sort of structures
[00:52:37] in place, you can then begin to start to, you know,
[00:52:42] just help other residents in the area sort of know what,
[00:52:47] what, you know, here's all the cool events that are happening
[00:52:50] in this area.
[00:52:51] And I think there's tremendous value in that.
[00:52:54] And it's, it just makes my heart happy.
[00:52:57] I know that sounds funny, but I'm like, it's just fun to be
[00:53:01] able to do this.
[00:53:02] And they're excited and I'm excited.
[00:53:04] And we're just sharing.
[00:53:06] And listen, like, you know, I want people to make money.
[00:53:09] I want my friends to do well.
[00:53:10] And so whatever I can do referrals are great.
[00:53:13] And hey, they remember me giving me referral.
[00:53:15] Of course, I want that.
[00:53:17] And it kind of always comes back closer to all.
[00:53:20] So it's a win win, for sure.
[00:53:23] Yeah, I totally, totally agree.
[00:53:26] And for anyone out there who is listening, who may want
[00:53:30] to refer business to Shaila.
[00:53:34] So Shaila, tell us a little bit more about what you provide
[00:53:38] for in Sarah Soda to your clients.
[00:53:42] Well, I have, it's not just me.
[00:53:45] I do have a full-time assistant and her name
[00:53:47] happens to be Shaila as well.
[00:53:50] So she's available.
[00:53:51] I know she's been with me about six and a half years now.
[00:53:55] And the Shaila's.
[00:53:57] So we have the two of us full-time.
[00:54:00] And I guess from working with my sellers and buyers,
[00:54:07] we're just at your service, basically.
[00:54:10] And happy to do that.

My conversation was Shayla Twitt. ["Snow Tower"] Okay, today on the show, our guest is Shayla Twitt. She's a luxury agent with Cold Wall Banker in Sarasota, Florida. Let me tell you more about Shayla. Now, Shayla has been selling real estate in sunny Sarasota, Florida since 2002, specializing in luxury and waterfront real estate in the Sarasota man, manatee and Charlotte County areas. She prides herself on her high touch and artfully curated concierge style. Originally from Steven's point Wisconsin, she also hails from UWSP with a business and a French degrees. She comes from a large family, many of which are entrepreneurs as well. With her extra time, she will either be in the gym, playing with her two dogs or cat or quite possibly volunteering with the fabulous team at the Humane Society at the Lakewood Ranch. To learn all things, Shayla, please visit her website sarasotarealestatesold.com. Let me say that again. Sarasotarealestatesold.com will have links to that in the show notes. Welcome, Shayla, welcome. I thank you so much. Say to talk to you, DJ. I'm excited to talk to you as well. We were, Shayla and I were talking just before the show about I love Sarasota. So I am so excited. In my mind, I'm sitting next to you, soaking up some of the warm of Florida right now. It is currently 11 degrees. No, I'm sorry, it is. Yes, it does 11 degrees here in Chicago. It is sunny, but very, very cold. So I appreciate you're probably having a warmer day than me. I'll try to bring some warmth your way. Shall we say, huh? Love it. You've really done some super impressive things. I always like to start at the beginning of the journey because so many of our audience really wants to know how you got started and then how you continued to evolve throughout your business. So how did you get into real estate? Well, I went, I didn't go to college to become a REALTOR. I went and I got my business degree and I came down to Sarasota home of the Ringling Circus. Yeah. That's a circus, all right. And my younger brother was here. I never knew anything about Sarasota and my younger brother who was going to Ringling Arts, which is a really prestigious arts school, by the way. Yeah. We didn't know anything about it. I didn't know anything about it only because my brother was here. And so he landed here. I came down right after college and because nothing was really kind of working out that calm. We used to apply for any jobs, you know? Sure. And nothing was exciting me anyway. And so I just, I had never been to Sarasota. I packed up my 19-in-one Red Olds Mobile. Okay, I don't even know how she made it all down here now. But I came, I moved right in with him, which was so nice to have a place in the upcourse with my brother. And moved to with him. And within the first six months, I kind of was figuring my life out. I got a little job at Outback, waiting tables. God knows I didn't go to school for that. But it was an interim job. And everywhere we went, everybody, the whole conversation evolved around real estate. And so I just thought like, I think I would do well at it. I would enjoy it and excel and just have fun with it. So I ended up just getting in and right away within the first six months of living here. Wow, that is quite a jump. And also too, Florida has the most number of REALTORS per capita of any state. So there's tremendous competition out there. I think I read somewhere as of, I think 2020, there were 195,000 in the state, which is insane. It's insane. It is. It is like, I think it was something like every fifth person in Florida has their real estate license. There's something it's something crazy like that. You know, that's going to change your coming up now. But I think a lot of that too is the people that are part time where they just do it here and there or sell to family. So we've got a lot of those. And then it's like, you have that population and then you have the population that actually makes a living. And then you have the top one for centers. I mean, there's other categories in between, but just to generalize. Yeah, no, I think you're right. We're starting to see here in Chicago, a mass exodus of the agents who are the ones Z2Z, do a couple deals a year. We're starting to see them exit the industry, which should be, I think, good news for a lot of our listeners. It's also good news for us because we have a holding company. So those agents transfer over into a holding company a lot of times to keep their license active. But the bottom line is they're people leaving the industry. And I think that will actually be beneficial to existing agents who are more full time or are really wanting to step on the gas in their business. Are you seeing that trend as well? I'm feeling it. I feel like it's right now as we sit here and we're recording this early February. So it's dated, but 2023. But it's kind of an interim time right now, I feel like. So the showings are down even for me. And I've got some listings. And so I can only imagine for a new agent, they're probably feeling that exponentially. And so you can't help but think that that's going to ultimately affect them financially. And I'm feeling the buzz around our office even. And we are in a top office. We do have some new agents there. And the buzz around the community, because I have a big, I keep my hand in the pulse within the community and my colleagues and just the talk about town. And there's only so much business to go around. And I think with agents exiting, exodusing, however you want to put it, that the cream will rise to the top and that sellers, if they're smart, knowing that their properties will take longer in the market. Now they're going to want the full service agents. Now they're going to want the full marketing package, marketing, advertising matter. And so if we don't have that experience, especially if you're new in the last two years, you don't know what you don't know. Yeah, I think you just said a lot of really great things. I think you're right. Now is the time to, if you are, if any of our listeners out there are wanting to really attract more sellers, this is the year to get your marketing packets, your listing presentations on point. There's a ton of services that can help you do this, but realize that right now, of course, listings are, there's a lot of competition for listings. So if you are going up against other teams, well, first of all, maybe consider joining the team, right? So if you want to be a big player in your local market, find out who the teams are that are capturing this business and take a look and see what are their marketing materials look like. What are those two presentations? If they're willing to share that with you, that's gold. I mean, if I were a new agent, I would seek out someone that's been in the business a long time that is a top agent and mentor with that person. They're willing to do that. That is absolutely priceless. You're not reinventing the wheel here. I'm not reinventing the wheel. I'm just doing what works for me as other agents do. And what works for me might not work for the other person, but I do think that honing in on your value proposition and really fine tuning it outlining it outlining that for your sellers important. I go in every single year and I revamp. I find to my marketing links that I send out as a prepackage to my sellers. I revamped that this year because I was like, I really want to express to sellers like all of the unique curated services that we offer each and every seller. I can't drive that home enough because sometimes I get stuck when someone says, well, how are you different? Why would I hire you? And it's like, I sometimes get stuck in the moment. So if you haven't already outlined in a format, it's so much better. You know, that is a really, really easily glossed over thing that I don't want to gloss over because really, having a list of services that you provide to your clients is critical because there are going to be those elevator kind of conversations where you only have, you know, maybe they're in-person conversations where someone's like, hey, so how are you different from every other REALTOR in town? You need to have three or four things that you say that you do ready to answer that question because let's face it, the other groups or teams or big producers in your local market have answers to those questions. Why should they trust you versus X? And it's not, of course, to ever disparage anyone who you're in competition with, but to sort of separate and elevate yourself. And so you do need to know your value proposition. I think that is such great advice. And it sort of goes back to like when I first left college and had my first job where they said, practice your objection handling, practice your value proposition, your elevator pitch in the mirror. I mean, it sounds silly, but you really should have three or four things or I'm asking, or I should I should I ask you, there should always be some information that you're able to provide about what's going on in the industry to talk when you meet people. Is that great? Yeah. I would say yes, absolutely. And when I look back at like my older value propositions, I was a little, I was two centered on me and it was more about me. And I'm like, this is not about me, how great I am. I think agents spent REALTOR, especially, I don't know if we're two ego centric or something like that. The ego is good, but to a point, right? You have to have ego and empathy, empathy for the other person's situation. So I totally switched that around and I made sure and I was very hyper focused on the fact that like, I'm curating first impressions for you and that's how we start the value proposition. Like everything I do is like an art, like you know, when you go and you make a painting and you start the painting, you step away from it and then you come back with new ideas. So you take your time and make sure that from the wording to the photography and the entire package presentation is really thoughtful and made for that person and for that property because everybody, everybody's property is as unique as them. And so we take so much time and care into just the remarks that we put out, they're really thoughtful. So we start from there and kind of move our way through like the presentation. Yeah, I love that. I think every home has a story, right? And every home should be able to have that story be told and really good REALTORS are able to do that. They're able to identify certain characteristics of a home or a personality type of a home sometimes even and really highlight and focus that. And that should all be coupled with the team or the individual agent's branding. So we really encourage everyone to think about this is the year to level up your sort of brand. And your brand. Yeah, you know how you want to portray your clients and their properties like you want to stand out like instead of saying like you know, pointing out the obvious in the remarks, like panel lifestyle, you want people to imagine someone in that home and having to walk glass of wine at the rooftop or whatever the attributes of the home you would have really highlighted the most and not cover up the objections but almost address them in a way that's more artful that you're not hiding something. Like if it's on a busy road, make it to a benefit. You know what I mean? So that you're not, you know, people aren't getting there and saying like, oh, there's a railroad track in the back but like you've already addressed it in a way that's creative to where, okay, they're showing it or they're coming to see this. This is probably a better quality showing because they kind of already know a lot of that stuff, you know. There is a marketing principle that I learned many, many, many years ago called if you can't fix it, feature it which basically means that, yeah, give all the information up front and so that when the person arrives there, you know, they're fully aware of what the situation, what the property has and doesn't have. I want to talk about leads because everybody, of course, this REALTOR businesses are contingent upon lead generation and I would love to know right now we know it's difficult, right? We have a higher interest rate environment that we then REALTORS would prefer for so our lending partners are telling us that we might see rates in the fives, maybe the low sixes this year for 30 year fixed rates that of course is going to have an impact on the number of buyers who want to participate. So we also know inventory has dramatically shrunk. So we have this two difficult challenges this year. We have low inventory and higher rates, although I think the rates are still pretty reasonable historically but what are you doing to keep busy, stay productive, stay active and stay positive? Well, I learned early on I was lucky and I have to be introduced to the Bafini and Company system of referrals and repeat, you know, that whole model. So I was very, you know, looking back at 20 years and still in that company of just getting, you know, having access to the backend system, which was great and the whole principle is behind it, which the definition of real estate is lead generation. It is and however, you want to break that down is your question. So, you know, for me, I've been doing this now almost 21 years so I really have my database so I'm careful to stay in touch with them, not too much but just enough. Like so no, here for me, you know, on a regular basis where, you know, they're passively on social media but they always get like that of the snail mail or an e-news letter every single month. And so, you know, seeing in touch with those people because if you're a long time agent, the biggest thing you can do with what I would suggest is go back and source your business and keep doing what works and not reinvent the wheel there and then figure out, okay, like 75% 80% comes from repeat referral for me. So, I keep touching those people, whether I call text email. I will say I started this within the last like nine months I want to say and every, I always touch them on the anniversary of the sale or purchase. Love that. So, I'm gonna pause you for a second because you were saying so much great stuff that I'm gonna slow us down a little because you're talking about home anniversary or we'll call it home sales transaction anniversary date. So, by the way, nobody knows their home anniversary date other than the real thing. This is a great opportunity to basically create a birthday event for the property. And make an excuse to reach out. So, I took it a step further because I wanted it to be more personal that this isn't a group email. Anybody can send a text. So, I made time in my calendar and you carve it out however you can and you can stack them but you go to the person's house or to the gate or however far you can get to the neighborhood or the clubhouse, whatever. It's far into the house as you can get and I do a personal video and I text it to them. And then I say in the video I say, happy anniversary, you bought the house, blah blah. And I just wanna see how the family is doing. Yeah, you know, whatever the message is. And then at the end of it I'll say, like I'm gonna follow up and send you your equity update in an email today so you get your annual equity update. It's hand selected, hand curated for you. And I've gotten so many good responses from that. Like it's part-worn. I mean, yeah, because I'm like, I get excited to do that for them and then I'm like, I can't wait for them to see it respond, you know? So it's fun. And what you're saying is simple and yet super brilliant in a way because it really solves a couple of problems. One is, okay, I'm not so busy right now because rates in the market and you know, I'm not as busy. What I could always do is do annual anniversary check-ins with my past clients or any, it doesn't even have to be a past client. It could be literally anyone who owns a property. You could just say, hey, you know, because I know as a homeowner, the thing that I would always be interested in hearing about is what's my, what's the property work, right? Yeah. So the idea of being able to send that to somebody on an annual basis, like, hey, I just, you know, did a little quick thing here for you. That is incredibly valuable to people, whether they want to move or not. And they remember that and you know, you can take that same formula and spin it however you want and whether they are just a friend and you can look up in the tax record and say, hey, I saw that you buy your house, whatever years ago, I just thought I'd send you an equity, it doesn't have to be a client. So if you're new and you're looking to get business, it's something to think about too. Like, you don't always have to be an agent of years and years and years. I mean, I started somewhere. I don't know what the hell I was doing, you know? All these things that you've developed over time, they just, they just become systems. And that's the other thing, you have to develop systems and consistency and just put the things in your schedule and do like, I'm a big fan of recurring tasks. So you do them every so whatever, so it pops up. This is what I have to do today. So you're not like, you know what you're gonna do in the calendar, it's already organized. Yeah, I think this is, it's so funny. So we're here in Chicago. There's 47,000 REALTORS in our market here. I can count on one hand. The number, so I moved into a place, new construction two years ago. I can count on one hand the number of mailers I've received, not that mailers are the, and all be y'all, but if anyone, by the way, Chicago, one of the most aggressive competitive real estate markets in the country, you would, and I live in a new development in the city, you would think that even though I just purchased a property, REALTORS would be consistently. Bombarding. Bombarding me with, hey, here's what your home is worth. Here's what your place is worth. Here's what the neighborhood's worth. Here, are you thinking of moving? I've got maybe one or two letters and two years. So this is a huge opportunity. And again, understanding that mailers aren't necessarily I do. Yeah. There's a huge opportunity out here to introduce yourself to people because every homeowner is not every homeowner, but most homeowners want to know what their home property value is worth, right? And they're going to go to Zillow. They're going to look up their zest limit because that's what people do. And then you're going to come in and say, you know, actually, I think Zillow's got it pretty close to right, but here's what I actually think your home is worth based on my own research. That you could do that all day long every day, right? Oh, yeah. Absolutely. And so to your point, I've been doing the mailers. So I think it's a market to market thing. I don't know. Mailers might not be for every market. I do feel like that's probably the case. I will say for me in my market, I do a lot on Longboat Key, which is just North East, yes, to Key in Sarasota. And it's actually spans Sarasota, Manasi County, nine miles. But so they are the demographics that are on Longboat, many snowbirds, lots of people that aren't even here. They're probably up in Chicago, you know, when it's cold. And so they are getting my mailers. And in the mailer, they get the listings, they get the QR codes of all the recent YouTube videos I've done and then on the back and some other things. And on the back, it's got all of the market stats for their neighborhood or what's transpired. So they're getting all that every single month without question. And so that's a regular, that's another system that we do to keep it tough. I love that. Yeah, so in between sales, you're touching each one of your contacts monthly or maybe even more often than that. How critical is having those structures in place so that people don't forget that you're their REALTOR, right? It's really important because you never know where the business is going to come from. Even though I've say or another agent says, I'll repeat referral, but at the end of the day, they remember you because you're sending stuff out and on a regular basis. And so I reach them even more than that because I do a YouTube channel too. And so I post on Tuesdays and Thursdays on my YouTube channel in addition to those among other advertising things that we do. And the YouTube channel, which goes into my mailer and it goes into my eNewsletter every single month. And what we do is we talk to area businesses. We do an end of the month market update in great detail. We tour restaurants. We give a lot of people really the neighborhood tours because it's like, okay, you can show a house and it's like to get the feel of the neighborhood. We take a step further. So for example, if I take a new listing, I do that home tour on the YouTube and then we do a whole neighborhood tour. And so our sellers love that too. And it's something that we have fun with and that we share with the public. And it gets people to understand like get to know Sarah Soda and what's here in the lifestyle. That is really quite smart because of course, when people move anywhere, they want to know what is the culture like, what's the lifestyle. And if as agents, it's so interesting you're mentioning this. I've definitely had on guests before who've talked about creating content, video content, specifically around different restaurants and retail shops and other community focused content to support the local industry, local industries. But this idea of doing it with, doing it so deliberately is really, really important, I think. And I love the fact that you're doing this regular video content about lifestyle. Like, hey, here's what it's like to actually live in this area. That is not necessarily real estate specific content, but it's incredibly important and valuable, along with schooling as well, community, different opportunities that exist. So how important are those sort of lifestyle markers? How important is that to help bring in clients for you? Well, it's been really a learning curve process. I will say that it is a marathon, not a sprint, that you two, I think, I think if you're not doing video, you're missing a whole channel pun intended of ways to get people to know who you are and to give us this. If you're just gonna do one or two videos, don't even do video, that's just my hardcore opinion on it because it's like you and everybody else stops. So if you're gonna do it, even once a week or every two weeks, like stick to a schedule, I'm starting to get more interaction with it. Now, I'm not up to even 500 subscribers yet, but it's been, it's a challenging platform, I'll say that, to grow. But it's been fun. I think that people are now calling and saying, oh my gosh, I'm sorry, YouTube, where they might have seen me, they might have Google me first or Google chair sort of REALTORS, you know, and then they stumble on me and then they see my YouTube goes to my website and it auto uploads on my website too. So that's why you gotta do so many things to be found, unless someone already knows about you. Yeah, so this idea of creating content for on social media for the public, for your sphere of influence. I've had hundreds of guests on the show over the years, and they all typically tend to focus on providing content, solving problems, I think, is a lot of times what drives content. So if you're a REALTOR out there and you're thinking about what should I be focused on on social media, I always think, you know, just write down the most common questions that you're receiving from your buyers, your sellers, and then start to create content around answering those questions. You know, like, and I imagine in Sarasota, because when people move, obviously there's just a lot of things outside of the house that are factored in. I mean, like we think, like so throughout the day, like as you have conversations, as problems come up, as unique circumstances come up, we just write them down, and we're like, oh, that'd be good video, this'd be good video. And a lot of the conversations I have are, okay, what are the, I want to be walkable to this, I have a dog, where are the dog faces? And we did a walkability video, we've done the dog part video, we've done the spa, the restaurants, it's not like anybody, like I said, anybody can just show a house all the time, and then if that works for your page, great, for us, I want to mix it up and make it fun. And just, again, it's just, it's people come here for the lifestyle, we have a lot of snowbirds here. That's my main market, you know, beachfront, canos, and all that stuff, and you know, they come and go, and it's been part of the year, or half the year, whatever. And they want to come here for the lifestyle and the sun, and you know, there's other benefits to, of course, the no-state tax and all the other stuff. Unlike in Chicago, where you're at with all the taxes. Sure. And so you want to tell them about all those great things and learn about the area in that way. Yeah, and I'd love, you know, being that you're in a competitive, Sarasota Southern Florida area, you're in a competitive agent environment here in Chicago, we are competitive as well. How do you differentiate yourself? What are some of the ways in which you sort of stand apart from other REALTORS? Well, I think, well, one of them is the YouTube channel, because I know there's so many just starting they completely fall off. I mean, they do. And it's interesting to watch that happen. And I'm happy to, you know, I guess not mentor people, or they come in to call me for advice, which is flattering, but I'm like, listen, this is how it is. Like don't even start if you're just not going to commit. You know, so I think because I put myself out there so much, you know, on social media and the various avenues, I did actually get recently approached to do a professionally produced series. And it's called Inside Luxury Listing Sarasota. We actually did a little flip in the studio yesterday. And so it's going to be really starting to be released in March. And again, that's something very different because it's collaborating with other agents in town, showcasing luxury properties that people couldn't get into otherwise unless they were on this show. And we're just doing a different spin on it. And by me collaborating with, I mean, I was asked, it was very generous offered to be asked to be on this. But now with SEO, I can tag him and her and they can tag me. And it's just like, it's going to be mutually beneficial. So it's not like, we don't look at that as competition. You know, we look at that as like, there's enough business for everybody. And by us coming together to give a different dynamic is just something really unique and fun and exciting. Yeah, I think agents can really partner up and do these things themselves. I, you know, even agents at different offices can really partner up and, you know, work together. Work together. It is called a cooperative commission. Let's not forget that. And yeah, there's so much opportunity out there. People have to live somewhere, right? And so, you know, I'm curious, what are you doing? Or what are you doing to help right now agents are struggling, interest rates, low inventory, buyers are in shorter supply than before when we were at 3% rates. So how are you staying active, busy? What are you doing to, you know, keep your business rolling forward? Well, I'm listening to, basically from the time I get up in the morning, I'm listening to positive content, like your channel here and others, just really positive mindset, real estate, millionaire, billionaire mindset, just positive and positive out motivational. I have routines, I think routines are really impactful and important in the discipline behind that because you can be motivated not discipline. So I feel crazy, I get up before, I get up before every morning and I get to the gym because the days I don't work out, I just have anxiety, I just feel off. So once I get that workout in, I'm so much more motivated to tackle the day and get things done. And I think that those little rituals that you do, whether it's journaling or meditating or getting up and working out or like playing with your dogs or what if you're going for a walk to start the day, I think is immensely beneficial for people if they just start and then they stick with it. Yeah, you know, I think the last five episodes I've done of people, interviews have been with all about Miracle Morning. So the Miracle Morning is a very common popular sort of practice in the sort of self-improvement world and having habits, disciplines are really kind of the keys to success. And so in this book, Miracle Morning, they talk about your physical health, your spiritual health, your basically setting yourself up for success early in the morning. So it's business, physical, personal, et cetera. So yeah, I'm a huge, huge fan of that. I imagine that book probably had a significant impact on you as well. So I guess maybe what I would be interested in is what your, from a customer perspective, what do you think is helping you separate yourself from the other agents in your area? What else are you doing aside from the CMAs? I think that, well, especially when I'm working with a buyer or a seller, communication is my reputation. So what I mean by that is, for example, I just took a listing a week ago today and it's different market now. We got to change things up here. So, and I'm reverting back to my old little habits that I did because over the last two years, you didn't have to do all this. And that way, one of them is, okay, it's been a week on the market. This is all, this is everything that we've done. All the marketing we're doing in Brokers Open, called the, you know, Cold Call, the Yadiata. And so it's all right there. And I like to do that before they can ask because when they ask, it's like, when the seller's saying, well, what have you been doing? It's like, you know, I want to be in that position. So I want to tackle it. I want to answer the questions before they even have the question. That's my approach. And we also do a 30 day, and I don't know beyond that, you know, we'll still do it if we have to do a 60, 90 day. But do that before they ask the question because it'll go a long way, not only just with putting them at ease, but also it will help if you need a price reduction because my seller's already thinking, sure, you said, okay, it's been slow. I think we've raised a little too high. Let them come up with it first. It's brilliant. Yeah, you know, it's funny. My boss, when he started our company here at Kale, I said, what, asked him, what was your goal, Nick, as a broker owner of a company and with your clients? He said, he only had one goal, which was, he never wanted his client to have to call him first. So I never wanted a client to have to call me first. I, so basically, you just said essentially the same thing. So you'll be ape. So this idea of reaching out and proactively, having communication with your clients, here's what's happening or here's what's not happening. Here's why, here's what, the what, why, you know, the, the, how, why, what, where, why, how, right? Like all just basically explaining, here's where we're at, here's what's happening and here's where we're going to move forward. And basically, and basically, doing what you said you were going to do based on the listing presentation or the marketing link or how we produce that or give that to him. This is everything we said we were going to do to this juncture and like, you know, that, that's your word and you're following during your word and you're being proactive, not reactive, sure. Yeah, yeah. So when, when listings stay on the market, and for longer, longer periods of time, of course, then that becomes, they become vulnerable to possibly losing those listings. And so this, this is a great opportunity. Guys, you really need to have a strategy so that, you know, communication policy, so that at a particular time, whether it's, you know, seven days, 14 days, 30 days, that you know that that that that that person is going to receive, the seller is going to receive information about how many eyeballs have, have checked out the property online, how many people have scheduled appointments, and then you can use that data to say, you know, based on other comps in the area, I'm not seeing as much interest in this property or we're seeing more interest in this property. And you can make adjustments from there. Is that how you sort of work it? Yeah, and, you know, your company might have like the automated, you know, they'll get the number of impressions or whatever per week. We also have that with cold, bigger, global luxury. So that's, that's already built into what they're getting. But I don't think that's enough, like, for them to just get an automated something, rather, from the company, you can think they need to hear from you. And another thing you can do, because you can get a feel for whether they call the text or email, you know, generally you can kind of tell people, like, go with that, you know, read between the lines and like, if they prefer phone call, call them and give them the rundown, and do it based on the client and their, and their comfort zone too. But I think all of these things will show that, it shows value. And again, you know, people are getting people that are still living in 2020, 2020 to market. This is going to be really critical in the 2023, you know, market coming up for price reduction requests, because you've already shown you, you're not just sitting around and calling them when there's time to reduce the price. You've been doing all this work, all this quality, and now, okay, we haven't had anything. Let's get the price down to sale. But, you know, yeah, let's talk about marketing. I would love to learn a little bit more about how you prospect. How do people find you? What advice do you have for agents who are, maybe they don't have a lot of buyers and sellers right now? What would you recommend for them? Well, everybody's got a phone. Yes or no? It's like a little computer that you carry around. You have people that you can call. I think what I see a lot of new agents doing, and it's like so redundant. All they do is they say, I'm a new agent, calling like a new business. I'm available for referrals, buyers and sellers. I can do this and that, whatever. But I say, like, give them information, give them value, give them answers to questions before they can get, like put that good content out there. It's still about content, right? And you can call, you can text them, you can email whatever FaceTime, and call your database, go out into the community and you have a hairdresser, go step by with like a little gift and just your card or something, but that's the Bafini system where they call Popeyes. You don't have to do stuff that's expensive, like I started out out of college and I need money. So you can start with a phone, you can start calling people. I didn't know anybody. I knew nobody in town. My brother's not gonna help me. He's in college. He's got his college buddies. He isn't know anybody. So I just started stopping by business. I just literally just walked into businesses, introduced myself. I mean, you gotta be out there. You have to, you can call, you can get phone numbers now online. Like you can just call a neighborhood and say, hey, did you know this is happening in your neighborhood? Like can I get your email, add them to the database. Now they're on a drip. Like there's so many things you can do, whether you're new or a veteran. I, such great advice. Adding people to your database is really the key and Europe, Bafini person. And everybody, we all love the Bafini and Company company. And what we want to do is really make sure that everybody understands that the most important thing for lead generation is adding contacts to your database. It just is. So if you, and I'm going back about 15 years, but Brian, Bafini and Joe Niego, they would hold each other accountable for meeting a certain number of adding new people to their database when they were practicing real estate. So they would call each other, say, did you meet two to five new people a day? That was their goal. It was to meet two to five new people every single day and add them to your database. Because as you know, Shaila, that your network is your net worth, right? That worth, yes. So, so I'm curious. So we were talking about staying in touch, right? We're talking about providing value, staying in touch in between the monoliths of buying and selling. So the transactions are the big, you know, big boulders. And then we have all these things in between. And what we really want to do is provide value to the client between those big boulders and curious on what types of content that you're providing to them so that they, you know, you remember that you're a REALTOR and that there are in any real estate needs that they can. But I'm here, right? Yeah. Well, you know, just again, from keeping people, like it's from, okay, like you can, things to do. You can go to the ballet. I mean, people are always looking for stuff like that. Like so in the e-news letter that we put out, there's a little more room than just the piece paper that we mail. So the e-news letter is a little bit of a spinoff of the mailer. And in that, there's more fun stuff, like fun happenings or like newsworthy things of serotonin areas and stuff like that. And like the restaurants and the other links and just different things like that. You know, and outside of that, I have a whole list. Yeah, I think which REALTORS who provide guides for their local communities. These can be incredibly helpful. Like this is a silly example, but I was visiting my father who was in Puria last week. And it's just a weirdest thing to say, but in Puria, there's a large Lebanese population for whatever reason. So I said, hey, dad, let's go to what's the best Lebanese restaurant in town, right? And so there's tons of them. And so we have a lot of them. We do. Yeah. And so I've been eating Lebanese food of my entire life because that's where I grew up. And I'm curious. Yeah. So I was like, this is really interesting. So as a result, we went online and there's like 20 different restaurants in Puria, there are Lebanese. And so we're like, I don't know which ones. But like those are the kind of things that I need to, you know, we need to solve that problem. And I didn't know which was the best thing. And this is where REALTORS can really add value and really differentiate themselves outside of even just real estate advice itself. Yeah. You want to be the mayor of Sarasota or mayor of Chicago or whatever. And I thought that term was funny, but it kind of fit. It's not he all stood that to me. They're like, hey, the mayor of Sarasota, I'm like, well, good. It's kind of the goal. By the way, I'm half Turkish. Are you, are you from the Lebanese? No, I'm not. I'm not. You don't look it. No, no, I'm not. But the idea is the idea of coming together and trying to create value for people by solving problems for them. So families need to eat. Families need to live somewhere. So this idea of providing content around those basic needs, oftentimes can be really fun and it's as simple as really just taking your phone and turning it around and turning the camera on and saying, hey, today I'm talking about X, Y and Z. But promoting locally and, you know, a lot of these businesses, the challenge here, this is such an opportunity, I think. REALTORS really miss out on this. So what they don't understand is that REALTORS, what REALTORS don't understand is that they can reach out to these businesses and offer them like, hey, I want to, I love your product service, your store, and I want to expose my audience to your, you know, your wares, your, you know, whatever you're shilling. And as a result, I would like you to also, you know, possibly, you know, mention me. So you're basically giving them free advertising by, you know, doing a real or video story about why you like this particular vendor in your local community. And then you can, from there, go on to create content, support of that community and then tag those, those, you know, different businesses in there. And hopefully drive more engagement. This is actually how my channel started. So it's funny you say that because I was just going to be doing like, logo, not just, but it's kind of started into from that, because I've got friends who own businesses and I just was like, I want to have you on the channel. It benefits me because it's on the channel, but really it's promoting you and I hope it drives, I hope it drives customers to you. And it's been so nice to give back in that way. And it's complimentary. We don't ask anything in return. We just, and we just, so we have one of the video. And then we promote the video from these different platforms, email, social media, and the mailers. So they get hit a few different ways. And, you know, we pay for all that advertising, of course. And it gives the customer the recipient of the piece of mail or email, whatever, something to look at and value. And I'm not honey. Let's go to this restaurant or let's go check out the football game at this bar or something like that. And it's cool. And actually, so we're coming up on our 300th video and we invited everybody that has been a guest, thus far, on the channel, to one of the first places I did a video at was Rafferty's bar downtown Main Street. And so we're going to have it at the bar. And we're just going to have like a happy hour. And it's we're going to do a little video and pass the microphone around. And it's just going to be like a big like to do and we'll tag everybody and it's just and then they can meet each other in exchange cards. And it'll be like a little business networking thing on top of having this great video. And it's just like, it just, it feels really good to do that stuff. And I didn't, I didn't see it coming, you know, this far, like it has and it's just been really enjoyable process. Yeah, you basically created a community. It sounds like. And that's really exciting. And people like community, we need it. We embrace it. And, you know, I always think like every single person always is thinking about the weekend, right? Like, what am I going to do this weekend? What are the events going on? What are what are we going to do with my kids? What am I going to do with personally? And when you have these kind of event sort of structures in place, you can then begin to start to, you know, just help other residents in the area sort of know what, what, you know, here's all the cool events that are happening in this area. And I think there's tremendous value in that. And it's, it just makes my heart happy. I know that sounds funny, but I'm like, it's just fun to be able to do this. And they're excited and I'm excited. And we're just sharing. And listen, like, you know, I want people to make money. I want my friends to do well. And so whatever I can do referrals are great. And hey, they remember me giving me referral. Of course, I want that. And it kind of always comes back closer to all. So it's a win win, for sure. Yeah, I totally, totally agree.
