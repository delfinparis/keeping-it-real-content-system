[00:01:14] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:17] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:21] Now as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:23] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:26] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:28] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:31] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:32] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:36] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:39] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:41] and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:45] to leave you.
[00:01:46] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:49] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:51] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:54] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:55] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:01:59] for each agent in your market
[00:02:00] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:04] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went
[00:02:07] and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:08] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:10] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:12] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:15] based on that agent's needs
[00:02:17] and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:18] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:20] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:22] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:25] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:27] corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:02:53] Hello and welcome to Keeping It Real,
[00:02:56] the largest podcast made by real estate agents
[00:02:58] and four real estate agents.
[00:03:00] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:01] I'm your guide and host through this show in just a moment.
[00:03:04] We're going to be speaking with one of the world's top agents,
[00:03:07] Ben Bacall.
[00:03:09] What a fun episode this was to record.
[00:03:11] I want you to pay particular attention
[00:03:13] to the way in which Ben prospects.
[00:03:17] It will most likely surprise you
[00:03:19] and hopefully inspire you to maybe do the same.
[00:03:23] Also, we have just launched a new video series,
[00:03:26] short form video series called AI agent minute.
[00:03:30] We push these out every other day or so
[00:03:33] on all the different social channels.
[00:03:34] So find us keeping it real on all the different channels.
[00:03:38] Hit that subscribe button every other day.
[00:03:40] What I do is I post AI prompt that either a top 1% agent
[00:03:46] told me that they use themselves or one that I am crafted
[00:03:49] for you to use.
[00:03:51] You could drop right into chat GPT to take your business
[00:03:53] to the next level.
[00:03:55] I would appreciate that.
[00:03:56] Let me know what you think about those videos
[00:03:58] and let's get right to it.
[00:04:00] My conversation with Ben Bacall.
[00:04:09] Angela Bacall.
[00:04:13] As a piece of advice, S.호 ever received in Real Estate.
[00:04:20] The best piece of recipe that I ever receive in real estate
[00:04:24] is you can find 2 ultra high net worth clients
[00:04:29] and if you can maintain another cant fail this莉
[00:04:32] relationships for your career that could set the base for you just to take off forever.
[00:04:41] Yeah, it makes sense. Oh wow. Definitely excited to hear more about that.
[00:04:46] Worst piece of advice you ever received in real estate?
[00:04:51] My geographic farm is more than two areas when I started real estate. It would be divorced.
[00:04:58] Worst. Meaning you should have only had one or you should have expanded.
[00:05:02] No, only had like one. Yeah, we're in Chicago. We have 77 neighborhoods just in the city.
[00:05:10] And you're in L.A. So obviously you have a similar situation there.
[00:05:14] Pick one of the calls. Is that a job that dominate, right?
[00:05:18] Yeah, that's right. Ben McCall is my guest today. He is the founder of Reval Real Estate in
[00:05:23] Beverly Hills. He has a huge, a huge presence there, a huge team.

[00:06:31] cool. Well, it's very cool for me to be able to talk to you because you have a very unique
[00:06:39] business and a very unique value proposition and it's it's rarefied air to some degree.
[00:06:45] And I've been doing the show for seven years and I always really love talking to
[00:06:51] agents that are so highly specialized. But I really want to get back to the beginning of the
[00:06:57] story or get to the beginning of the story so that our listeners can hear sort of how you started
[00:07:02] and how you ascended in building your business. So how did you get into real estate?
[00:07:08] My mother is a broker in Canada and I'd watch her in excruciating pain dealing with her clients and
[00:07:18] I said I want to live a life of extreme angst and anxiety for the rest of my life. So let me do that
[00:07:26] for a business like mother likes son. You are at least successful. I love that. Yeah, it is it is
[00:07:35] funny but entranau is a particularly challenging market. People can't sell their houses there.
[00:07:44] Yeah, right. Yes. The bubble has burst. Oh boy. Is your mom still practicing?
[00:07:51] She's not. No, but she she was great. She's she's a good communicator. Maybe that's part of my
[00:07:59] that's helped me in my trajectory in my career. Yeah, so so you moved out to LA when you were
[00:08:07] what 17? Yeah, entranau. And then tell us how you how you got involved in real estate.
[00:08:14] Yeah, I was making movies and going to film school so I wanted to make enough money to buy IP
[00:08:23] Sure and make sure make make while starting short films and then videos and then I just got
[00:08:29] addicted to my first deal. I you know after doing you know 30-day escrow and working with closely with
[00:08:39] the heads of the family it was a small deal. I'm sorry it sounds so grand but just this
[00:08:47] family that I was working with in Venice Beach. It was so cool that they trusted me
[00:08:51] and trusted me with this 1.4 million dollar deal in Venice. It was like wow this is cool. I'm 25
[00:08:57] years old and I just closed their sale and they're so happy and I got them another property
[00:09:02] and that felt really um really powerful so that the whole process from you know putting it out
[00:09:10] there and marketing and negotiations was exciting. So I was like okay I'm gonna stop
[00:09:14] maybe in the entertainment business. I like I love homes and I love people and um
[00:09:22] yeah that's how it happened. I was door knocking in Venice Beach. So my my my mother being the agent
[00:09:30] she goes bad you need to focus on just the low end of the real estate market. This was just
[00:09:36] right after the you know the bubble burst here in 2008 and my first year real estate I made about
[00:09:44] I made $394,000 my first year. Amazing. Which I didn't realize how that it was amazing until I
[00:09:51] own a brokerage and have you know 65 agents and realize how you know determined you one has to
[00:09:59] be in order to be I hear at your top right so I didn't give up I didn't let my head hit the pillow
[00:10:06] every night until I probably talked to you know dozens of people and asked hundreds of people during
[00:10:13] the week if they wanted to sell their home if not thousands. Wow so you were you were literally
[00:10:19] prospecting just nonstop. Just nonstop and uh I was just like I got to see I can't stop door knocking
[00:10:26] or call calling until someone says yes that day and then I would and then I would go home and be
[00:10:31] like okay and then I would be dreaming about the people I'm talking about um thinking who I
[00:10:36] could who have to call next to follow up with and back then there wasn't really any CRM systems
[00:10:41] not like that was that long ago 2005 or there was there was like high rise that I used
[00:10:46] um and they were not that intuitive definitely no no AI at that point no no no machine learning
[00:10:53] and large language models to like help me you know direct my focus on to different people um but
[00:11:00] I would lose a lot of deals like oh every every week I'll go on that more specific oh I forgot
[00:11:05] to look out listed on Noida like I listed on Millwood I knocked on that door I talked to that
[00:11:10] person and it was like I was beat beat it was always beating myself up because I probably could have made
[00:11:15] a million dollars that first year I just followed up and had like a proper proper systems in place
[00:11:21] I mean it's amazing it's like you know you as you think back it's like I shot for the what is the
[00:11:26] expression I shot for the Sun I landed on the moon you know it's like you still landed pretty pretty
[00:11:32] far out there like you still had a great year but as you look back you go wow there were a lot of
[00:11:38] inconsistencies that I could have done even better I want to talk about door knocking for a moment
[00:11:42] because everyone who's listening who is never doorked probably cringes at the thought of a doork
[00:11:49] and you know how did you was that something that was easy for you and and curious to know like what
[00:11:56] your approach was there well you know it's all about your approach like he said it's all about
[00:12:04] your intention so I often went out with intention of a client that I was actually genuinely looking for
[00:12:12] so it came from a place of authenticity yeah and it also was very conversational so I'll like
[00:12:19] take out my agents that I recruit that come to the office even if they've done 50 you know
[00:12:26] hundred million dollars or maybe they've done ten or twenty they I talk about I talk about
[00:12:31] door knocking they go will you go door knocking with me and I'm like you're sure I was like yeah
[00:12:35] I'll come door knocking with you if you promise to go five more times without me and talk to 20
[00:12:39] people a day so it's the approach is I go out and I'm it's more conversational you know
[00:12:47] a walk by a door I saw see it'll look pretty house and unlock I'm like hey just one let you know
[00:12:54] my client was looking in your neighbor in your house is so gorgeous oh thank you so much yeah
[00:13:00] like yeah it's how long have you lived here for whatever a couple of years I'm like listen I know
[00:13:06] maybe probably don't want to but if you ever want to sell I've got a great buyer you totally
[00:13:11] you love your house I'd love to do yeah and then they'll be like well thank you we're staying here
[00:13:16] we're leaving feet first I'm like okay no problem if you have any any friends or you know
[00:13:21] family that want to move in the neighborhood I have a lot of off-market deals and maybe I can get
[00:13:25] your number and then I'll put my phone out and I'll say what's your number and I'll say it out loud
[00:13:30] that way they actually give me the number because most of the time they'll say leave your card
[00:13:33] sure in the mailbox but it's more you know I honestly say with me smiling and matching
[00:13:43] mirroring how they're reacting to me will create an instant rapport and a trust that will
[00:13:51] hopefully cultivate into a phone number contact an email follow up and then they become my
[00:13:57] my friend and they provide them value over the years and they just you know either I provide
[00:14:00] the value by bringing them up the buyer if they want to make money or if they're not ready you just
[00:14:05] want to create a relationship sure and not be a pushy salesman so I think I attribute a lot of
[00:14:10] that door knocking success I wasn't too salesy and I direct to the point that was actually confident
[00:14:17] even in my early days of what my intention was and what my what I wanted to accomplish
[00:14:23] and it came off as as as important to listen to me what I had to say to these people
[00:14:31] there was a day when there wasn't rings anymore so the ring camera doesn't help too much
[00:14:37] that's true yeah it probably makes it a little a little bit more challenging but what is
[00:14:41] I want to sort of unpack this a little bit and because I've done 700 of these episodes over
[00:14:48] the last seven years you're the you might be while my memory is terrible so you might not be the
[00:14:53] first person that I've ever interviewed for door knocking but let's say you are because I think
[00:14:57] you actually are and I do want to talk about this because it is an absolute no go for so many
[00:15:04] people to even consider and the way that you described it by the way what I anticipated you saying
[00:15:10] before we got to door knocking was well yeah I worked in the entertainment industry I was behind
[00:15:15] the scenes I was you know with all these production companies and I just kind of leveraged
[00:15:19] though that network to build by business and you did not say that you said oh I went out and
[00:15:24] knocked on strangers doors and I was like oh my god how'd you do that and the way that you just
[00:15:29] explained it made all the sense in the world because it really is kind of a low stakes situation
[00:15:34] you're not asking for a sale you're not selling a product or even a service you're literally saying
[00:15:40] oh my I have somebody that is looking in this neighborhood or I just help somebody in this neighborhood
[00:15:47] I need more homes like yours so when you are ready please call me and it's kind of an easy
[00:15:53] yes there's not really any commitment they're giving other than wow this person just
[00:15:59] flattered my property and gave me a nice compliment and also you're a super nice person
[00:16:06] so that also I don't quite understand the apprehension with getting out there because especially
[00:16:15] if you live in sunny California you're no excuse most of us sitting at their computer hurting
[00:16:20] their back although you can get out there and feel the sun it gets some vitamin D and go talk
[00:16:24] to 20 random people and it doesn't have to be so like door to door to door to door you can just
[00:16:28] sure how's that you like I listen I doorked and then I elevated my game and I cut my teeth on more
[00:16:36] expensive properties that's that's also another problem people are so eager to get into the luxury
[00:16:41] they see like these high-flying ticket items being sold for 20 30 40 and I want to go there
[00:16:47] it took me like five years to start selling my first six million dollar home some people there's
[00:16:53] been anomalies that have like gone right to the top and sold 10 20 million dollars within two years
[00:16:58] but took me a minute but I I built my database so for instance I doorked in I guess it was probably
[00:17:06] like 2010 and that house was owned by a surgeon medium logo and I stayed in touch with them
[00:17:16] and I called them you know every year to see if I could bring a buyer he ended up selling the
[00:17:23] property to a basketball star so I missed that on that sale but I kept on calling and guess what
[00:17:29] I sold that home last year for 80s for actually 150 million dollars amazing all because I
[00:17:35] doorked and met that relationship and stayed in touch and yeah you know that's how that's that
[00:17:42] you know but there's another part of that equation it's it's it's your social etiquette and your
[00:17:47] emotional maturity yes and if either you had that or you don't you know how to communicate with
[00:17:56] people and it's not a high pressure situation just the way you talk to people my dad's a psycho
[00:18:02] manless I come from a family I guess I'm blessed in that sense that I'm fortunate to have grown up
[00:18:08] and you know a middle-class family in in Canada and I'm surrounded myself with other highly intelligent
[00:18:17] people that had common sense and courtesy and decency in the world and and and appreciated
[00:18:23] you know what it is to what it is to have emotions and and be cognizant of other people's feelings and
[00:18:29] and let people be heard instead of talking at them so it's that like you know it's how people
[00:18:38] want to communicate and that's why I don't think you know AI is not going to take this whole business
[00:18:42] away because people want that emotional connection and that's what REALTORS give and they're able to
[00:18:48] really and it's a huge at stake business you know it's a huge you know it's your it's you often 30 40
[00:18:57] percent of people's in that work so they want to be able to talk to somebody right absolutely and I
[00:19:03] so again I'm just I'm going back to the this approach of the the cold open which is essentially
[00:19:09] what you're doing and what you're doing is it's it's a very smart play because it is it is
[00:19:17] for example I live in a condo building so it would be harder for somebody to do this for me in fact
[00:19:22] we'd have a security issue if somebody was able to knock on my door but the idea of maybe receiving
[00:19:28] a letter in the mail or or or phone call possibly I'm sure I'm I'm sure my phone numbers out
[00:19:33] there where and I don't think everybody knows that I have a real estate license I don't use my license
[00:19:38] so the irony is I don't even use my license but I don't think that's not the reason I'm not getting calls
[00:19:45] I don't think that's the reason I'm not getting calls and I suspect you know it would be very
[00:19:49] flattering if somebody said hey I know you moved in five years ago yeah and you're I don't know what
[00:19:56] your life situation is a buyer real family we have to live yeah I love that way that is it is
[00:20:03] without letter things came in the the kernel the idea that's a former prospecting sure if you're
[00:20:09] not door knocking in every day then in your call calling that a letter you can write a letter and
[00:20:14] you can be very specific about who that that person is right that perfect the personification
[00:20:21] of that family yeah what seems so it is real and you could say my client's looking for this kind
[00:20:27] of property which is your property and your address handwritten yeah if you put in that work and
[00:20:32] handwrite letters that's what your your risk is going to be hurting by the end of the day 100
[00:20:36] we're feet are going to be pain and pain from door knocking you're going to be tired again too
[00:20:41] much you get a bit more sunscreen on your your thirsty you need to go to the bathroom your
[00:20:46] your through throat is tired you're like done with the rejection that's when you know you're
[00:20:51] going to be successful yeah and if you're not 10 times better than anyone out there in this
[00:20:57] business yeah then this is this is a part-time game and that's okay maybe people just you know they
[00:21:04] want to you know you want to live a life of uncertainty and you don't want to build wealth
[00:21:08] wealth generation no wealth then that's where you want to be but if you want to be at the top of
[00:21:15] your game you got to be you have to be 10 times better than everyone else and and there's very
[00:21:19] few people that's why they say 90% of the business is done by what 10% at the top right because they
[00:21:24] just they work their tail off you know they're consistent yeah they do I've interviewed some of the
[00:21:31] very top agents in in the world including your now now adding you to the list as well and I've
[00:21:37] been doing that for years and and I do ask like what's your secret and usually it's I just I work
[00:21:42] people you know you got to be you know you can give the gift of the gab be relatable be a kind person
[00:21:51] smile be confident understand your market know the values and talk to 20 people today and follow
[00:21:57] up with them it's that's it it's it's it's it's as simple as that and then you have to like get
[00:22:03] out there and make connections and if you build a good reputation in other agents respect you
[00:22:08] that is and then you can you'll sell a lot of property that is not on the open market so you can
[00:22:15] you can you can make you can match you know people to properties and and you can do that at any price
[00:22:20] point so that's that that's also vital I think relationships building relationships and and I
[00:22:26] think of one of my sellers who was a broke what sorry one man eat one of my sellers one of my buyers
[00:22:32] he's a buyer seller he taught me an important lesson he said you know bend this business is about
[00:22:37] sharing right you want to share so you know if I if someone if I mean interviewed for a listing that
[00:22:47] expired that's you know maybe you know that's fair game but if you want to work with everyone in
[00:22:53] your community is agents they're they're your life run right then the buyers and sellers will come
[00:22:58] but you want to you really want to work closely with other agents and you want to be sharing with them
[00:23:02] you know a lot at my company revel if I seen agent come in and he is everything that we're talking
[00:23:09] about he or she they're putting in the effort and they're putting in the work and they're in their
[00:23:13] consistent and I I will actually put them on my listing and offer them like a service fee so they
[00:23:19] can build their repertoire of getting to 10 20 million so they have a resume yeah I did that myself
[00:23:25] I didn't have any it's very generous you do that for me but that's what I do with my company you know
[00:23:30] you'll see if you go to any one of my listings you'll see me and LA one and LA two which is in
[00:23:35] in the multiple listing service and I'll tell you just other my people in my office that way
[00:23:40] they have a resume so sharing is important does that make sense you know sharing not not not not
[00:23:46] not in that respect just like in the commissions you know of course as a broker we get in the middle
[00:23:51] you know the commission disputes within the offices you know what's the time who walked through
[00:23:57] the property and so forth and that's always something fun to navigate but but the idea of you at
[00:24:04] least putting them on the official listing as LA one and two is really a generous thing I again
[00:24:13] maybe other people I've interviewed do that I've never heard anybody say they do it with basically
[00:24:20] every listing especially for you know more junior agents I I can't imagine what that must do to
[00:24:27] some the loyalty these agents must have for for revel and you know people know this but if they
[00:24:32] look at them alas they can see they can see that I do that but about but you know you have to be with
[00:24:37] me for a certain amount you know sure of course to gain to gain that trust or or if I actually see
[00:24:42] that you're a go-getter right that you know you're a go-getter and you're making that happen and
[00:24:47] you're closing sales that's much more right because if you're not closing then you pretty much know
[00:24:53] they're if they're putting in that that 110% right absolutely and I'm sure when you get interviewed
[00:25:01] you probably get asked questions about celebrities I'm not going to ask you questions about specific
[00:25:05] celebrities because you know they're just people like us however I am curious is working with
[00:25:12] celebrities you know a different experience than a you know traditional you know buyer seller
[00:25:21] do they do are there more masters to serve are there managers and and agents that also are part
[00:25:27] of the experience or are you working more specifically one-on-one directly with with the celebrity
[00:25:33] yeah they're definitely not like us they there's an expectation of where I want to be in my head
[00:25:42] is is trumped everything else so you have to cater to that to that personality and just be mindful
[00:25:51] the fact that that any request is as amazing as it is you have to cater you have to cater sure
[00:26:03] with note with note with no opinion yeah it's it's definitely it's it's a bit heart it's not so sexy
[00:26:14] sure sure it's actually like we're talking about celebrity like fame like actor
[00:26:21] spin-fluencer that that kind of thing it's it's it's it's interesting but it's fun I mean they're
[00:26:28] great people and you can there was a reason why like when you're around them like they're the
[00:26:34] some of some they're the presence that they it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's
[00:26:44] also hard work you know yeah well it's you it's especially with some celebrities that just have
[00:26:50] that that garner a high price point for for their acting or or music services or whatever in
[00:26:55] entertainment they're doing is they are getting catered to and they have a lot of people
[00:26:59] surrounding them that are going to help them throughout their day and you're right they're
[00:27:04] probably you know and it's not that that there's anything wrong with this they're just used to
[00:27:10] being able to get things and having other people do those assignments because that's their world
[00:27:16] and I imagine you having to step into that world is is is yeah but probably a bit of a a challenge
[00:27:23] initially is like okay now I'm I'm part of this team and I get to to do some of the the the the
[00:27:30] actions that maybe other non-selebrities will think to ask me there's some like like you mentioned
[00:27:37] that Damon when when we were showing property to him he would how a whole conversation with like
[00:27:43] the Butler for the maid in the house like for like I believe I was mad he's over there he's
[00:27:49] like having a 10 minute conversation like just so and so you just appreciate himself and he's
[00:27:55] just a guy of gratitude so warm and loving yeah and the flip side of that you clients that are
[00:28:02] all of them are really like that but then the day you know they look at you as a purpose to make
[00:28:08] things happen sure and if they feel like you know you're taking advantage or you're you're you're
[00:28:18] you're done yeah pretty quickly you know because they deal with that all the time people do try to
[00:28:23] take advantage they do try to you know a glamon or or get something from them and they probably
[00:28:29] are constantly evaluating is this person with me because they authentically like me as an individual
[00:28:35] and they want to help me or they want to be my friend or are they with me because I'm you know
[00:28:40] popular and and and and mouth well to do so yeah they probably have a very tuned in sense of that
[00:28:46] and you being as authentic as you are probably are our breath of fresh air for you know sometimes
[00:28:54] these these people might have to meet other I guess I bet they're just constantly evaluating
[00:29:00] because this person really want to want to help me or are they one to help themselves.
[00:29:04] Celebrities like you know not not just like TV personalities but like heads of industry I consider
[00:29:11] those in my mind celebrities and I'm you know equally as like in awe and nervous around you know
[00:29:19] you know for all these years you know showing Jeff Bezos a house he wasn't my client but you
[00:29:25] know I showed him a couple of houses and he'd been in his presence was pretty cool and the head of
[00:29:30] you know different social networks that you know the mate when they came around I was like okay
[00:29:37] this guy like is like the 30th richest person in the world the 10 richest person
[00:29:42] world the power that they yield is is is pretty cool that they're asking they're looking at me
[00:29:47] and they're asking me some questions that I have to their pivotal to his to his calculation
[00:29:54] so that's it that's that's kind of wild right. Well especially like a Jeff Bezos who's so
[00:30:01] so intelligent when it comes to finance and business obviously right so we all know this and
[00:30:08] I that would be tremendously intimidating I suspect because but there are things he doesn't know
[00:30:13] and that's why you're there and obviously for him to look at you is. No it's everything but like
[00:30:20] other people yeah I mean they all know everything they have everything at their fingertips but what
[00:30:26] you're bringing to them is is the opportunity of or her the opportunity of properties there are
[00:30:34] not maybe on the market. I'm actually a new agent that's a good way to like really get in there
[00:30:41] is by putting in the hard work and finding inventory because that's what our business is all about
[00:30:45] she's really finding inventory and and and trying to get in contract to exclusives to sell
[00:30:53] that inventory and then connect in the dots. You you have a really unique sort of insight into
[00:31:00] these titans of industry and you you know you work with celebrities but you also work with people
[00:31:06] who are you know in the business world at at the top of of their respective fields and I suspect
[00:31:13] over time you've probably learned a lot as well about either running your own business or just
[00:31:20] navigating life or doing things more effectively I suspect in addition to obviously being an
[00:31:25] incredibly effective agent you've probably just learned from these people just being around them
[00:31:30] and watching them operate. I did learn I guess a big lesson that I've learned and I'm when I've
[00:31:37] learned over time is to stay super focused on one one one bit one core business to be successful
[00:31:44] I think that's important you know so and I have deviated from that because I'm an entrepreneur
[00:31:51] entrepreneur at heart and it's bitten me you know distracted me but it has also opened up opportunities
[00:32:01] to meet other entrepreneurs to have those conversations to be able to have those conversations with tech
[00:32:07] founders and and glean from them and understand their business and what they're up against and
[00:32:14] what their stress points are so all that it's it's been a life I went to basically I
[00:32:22] wanted to I did my own business school you know yeah you know it cost me a lot of money but
[00:32:26] I went to business school and I paid for it and I learned my I learned my own you know my own P&L
[00:32:33] and how to work that yeah I it boy it's so so interesting that you just the access you have to
[00:32:41] these people really helps you probably sharpen your skills because number one you have to have
[00:32:47] sharp really sharp tools to be able to provide service to these individuals but also they have
[00:32:53] sharp tools in their own respective fields and you get to sort of see them operate I think that
[00:32:58] wow what a what a what a cool honestly the the coolest part of this business is the fact that I
[00:33:05] when I'm Brad presenting these these kinds of the industry and I get to hear about what they're
[00:33:10] doing day to day in the in the way that they created their legacy it's just so it's so wild it's so
[00:33:18] cool it's like it's like real life chapters are reading reading these amazing biographies of
[00:33:26] these people in a real life you know when they tell you what they're doing and then I asked them
[00:33:30] how did you get there and the word you start and it's the stories are so cool you know now this
[00:33:36] podcast all over that that when you can watch these people do the same thing but it was it's great
[00:33:42] to like be next to them in real life and you're instead of going on a million you're right beside
[00:33:47] them and that and that's and that's pretty cool I love that that singular focus suggestion that
[00:33:55] that you you gave is really so important it the science and and the data's in we cannot multitask
[00:34:03] whether it's you know doing just a little to-do's during the day or whether it's focusing on our
[00:34:09] business or whatever projects we're we're into yeah well I I have I have ADD so I'm wondering if
[00:34:17] the people you've interviewed do a lot of them at like the sex successful agent on ADD on almost all
[00:34:24] of them right there you go so you know I'm pretty focused on other questions you're asking me but as
[00:34:29] you're talking to me I'm as you're talking with me I'm thinking of like 10 few other things in my
[00:34:35] head but what that's an aim of me to do is put them down or execute on everything really quickly so
[00:34:42] instead of just doing one task I can't execute a multiple task sure or at least write them down so
[00:34:49] I will execute my mind's always so I'm much of a that's called mop I tasking so yeah I
[00:34:57] as far as you're doing it in the same field you know you're not doing it like all different things but
[00:35:01] yeah I'm I mean it's it's interesting how much we're able to to execute during the day and I
[00:35:07] think AI 100% I use that in my it streamlines everything like I used to my big part of my success
[00:35:15] um was writing a comparative market analysis for my clients understand why am I paying 20 million
[00:35:21] when the highest sale in the neighborhood was 10 right and I took full comps and do this and then
[00:35:25] write explanations so now you can be like you can say an inaudible to five sentences that make
[00:35:33] somewhat of a sense some reason AI understands me and they're able to like boom and I can send a
[00:35:38] message right or or if I have an idea of like why I'm convincing someone of an opportunity or
[00:35:44] you can AI will will help navigate that or where I should be going during the day let's quicker
[00:35:51] um it's uh it's it's helpful to streamline things and make you just go you your time is is money
[00:35:58] right yeah getting your time right and you want to be prospecting so as much as that is possible
[00:36:04] do you have a particular structure to your day and is it I understand your days probably look
[00:36:11] wildly different from one another but in general do you have a structure that is consistent
[00:36:17] yeah it's it's working out every five to six days a week in the morning and it's spending time
[00:36:25] with my dog so um he's happy and that gives me some happiness and love so I do that um and then I'm
[00:36:35] head to the office to follow up with the thousands of people that I have built over the years
[00:36:43] that's my goal we're just talking to people all day long because something clicks and then
[00:36:48] obviously there's uh there's showings that I have to go to I'm off I'm I'm lucky by
[00:36:54] getting listings and putting on my agent's onto being LA1 or two to help service the deal so
[00:37:00] they can open the house for me and get it ready and I show up and I can my help solve that house
[00:37:05] and then I'm back at networking and people are everyone who I pushed out against the what I mean
[00:37:11] push out what I want that I reached out to will start texting me back and that's a fault
[00:37:15] talk to all those people and then it's just ransom repeat it's very repetitive it's tedious
[00:37:21] and but it's consistency and and and I think I know in life when things are monotonous and the same
[00:37:30] you're actually happier so if you create a hundred each day no matter how you know boring it is
[00:37:36] and I've done it then it's good to you know I go to Europe for once a year for three weeks
[00:37:42] and I detach and then I come back rejuvenated and ready to go but I wasn't doing that for so long
[00:37:49] for me for ten years I was just working straight but didn't take any vacations at all
[00:37:53] sure you refuse to until I can go first class that's well hey that's a great marker and
[00:38:00] I think the consistency is it's it's the fundamentals right where we're talking fundamentals
[00:38:06] we're talking the boring repetitive tasks the the push-ups of real estate so to speak that nobody
[00:38:14] like I don't want to do a wall sit but it's a really good idea for my legs and I was doing them
[00:38:19] yesterday and I was you know it's just in the middle of a wall sit this isometric exercise that
[00:38:26] by the end of it my legs are shaking and I just I just want to collapse and I go oh I only have
[00:38:31] another five seconds or my trainers telling me I have another five seconds and I'm like I can't
[00:38:35] do another five seconds and then I I get to that end and then I then I collapse and I think
[00:38:42] yeah well it's funny because I think this is the least fun thing I could possibly be doing right now
[00:38:48] the outcome of it means you're going to be more mobile as you get older yes and you'll be able to
[00:38:55] appreciate enjoy life in your in your later years and your goals in your golden ages you'd be more
[00:39:00] and I'm I'm pushing against resistance which is good for my mind it's good for my body obviously
[00:39:05] good for my muscles but more important than anything is I'm doing the hard good thing right and
[00:39:12] that's what you are talking about is doing the hard good things that maybe they're not sexy and fun
[00:39:18] sometimes they might be but but often they're they're repetitive they're monotonous but they work
[00:39:24] and and on top of that then now to align ourselves to a different triangle of success we've
[00:39:33] talked about consistency doing things that are difficult for you pushing to all that all that
[00:39:41] and all that stuff that gets you there but then you want to align yourself with that's with someone
[00:39:46] who has done it right yes that's why there's teams people are so gravitating towards all these
[00:39:52] teams these days because if you're a new agent or if you're been in the business you know I'm a new
[00:39:57] for for five ten years it's good to leverage other people's success and have them in your corner in
[00:40:03] case you need to lean on them to to to get that listing and that's a big part of my my business
[00:40:10] um back in the day when I went for my first listing I brought in top agents and it was better to
[00:40:17] get 50% of something than nothing and a lot big mistake I see new agents here there's you know I've
[00:40:24] hired agents and and I'm like okay I can come to the listing with you like you just doorknob to
[00:40:29] met or a call call then I see I talked to this guy I talked to this guy my great set that meeting up
[00:40:33] and then they don't and and then they they're they fail they're out of the business because they're
[00:40:40] so like hoarding their their chestnuts and yes what I said at the beginning it's about sharing
[00:40:46] it's about leveraging so you know team up with a top agent like myself come to my office I will
[00:40:52] I'm your business partner don't go be a business partner with another new newbie agent because
[00:40:57] that agent is willing to go door not to with you because you don't have the you don't have it in
[00:41:02] you to do it go do it yourself and team up with the top agent who's high at a higher level than you
[00:41:08] yeah higher higher vibrations higher level to to get to get those listings because you don't have
[00:41:15] a resume so that's important that's that's important to do and that's that's why everyone is
[00:41:21] gravitate towards teams but it becomes a bit of a crutch after a while if you're just doing a
[00:41:27] team thing for years and years and years but again that brings me back to like how far do you
[00:41:31] want to go if you want to be two times better than everybody else five times it's 10 times 10 times
[00:41:36] means you're a millionaire five times means you're going to be making you'll be breaking even
[00:41:42] or you in life you know and you every day right it's going to be a struggle depends where you want
[00:41:47] to be you know so does that make sense yeah that's what you know I did that in my early years I
[00:41:53] and I teamed up big and today you'll look on listings and sometimes I'll have to bring in another
[00:41:58] top agent because I know I'm competing against you know someone who's sold 10 8 billion and I need to
[00:42:06] bring in another guys and four three so it measures up right so it's about sharing you know we don't
[00:42:12] need all of them you just want to like get the notches on the belt to have success so you can you can
[00:42:18] the more signs you have out on on the street the more you're going to get hired it's just visibility
[00:42:24] right there's a brain agent and in Venice Beach and that agent takes all of the listings throughout
[00:42:30] all of Los Angeles and puts for signs that it looks like she monopolizes like the area like 30
[00:42:36] signs everywhere she did some of these signs are like these listings are probably in another state
[00:42:42] but it's all about perception right right I even I even give my Bentley uh car to my agents to
[00:42:49] drive go to a listing appointment so they want to have you know they don't want me to go in the car
[00:42:52] they should have me go I let them drive yeah I know I like whatever it takes right I think yeah there's
[00:43:02] there's a persistency but this idea of not seeing a finite amount of opportunity like you don't see
[00:43:11] finite you see infinite and you you're not worried about sharing because there's other opportunities
[00:43:18] that will come as a result of sharing and the the givers get mentality if I give I get and that
[00:43:25] is obviously served you incredibly well and so much of us want to fix manage and control the the
[00:43:32] things that are within our purview and nope nope I don't want anyone to touch those chestnuts and
[00:43:37] you're right it's a mistake it well it I guess it's not a mistake if you're not willing to see the
[00:43:42] world as infinite if you if you see the world is there's only a finite amount of resources then yeah
[00:43:47] I guess maybe you should hoard them but that's not really the pathway to success and or at least not
[00:43:53] maybe the best pathway to success so I think you need to do that and you need to get things in writing
[00:43:59] because often people are not held to you know everything in writing it's like yes
[00:44:05] you're like I am going to go do an open house just with you with you and sit the open house
[00:44:10] what does it look like if a fire walks through the door yeah because in our business there's
[00:44:15] so many like nuances like where did that person derive from and who worked the hardest on a deal
[00:44:21] and and when you call list of properties not about like who worked the hardest about getting a listing
[00:44:26] and being being a partnership because you all bring in your strengths here and there but putting
[00:44:31] things in writing is vital and really smart and yeah you have to you have to do that otherwise
[00:44:38] you're going to be left with absolutely nothing you know I put a gale together one of my agents and
[00:44:43] I was like we need to get saying in writing and I'm like no no no this happens so many times but
[00:44:46] I got so pretty much a Europe and we put the put the deal together it's a 15 million dollar
[00:44:51] development deal and we're supposed to get a fee for putting them together they're now together and
[00:44:55] of course I'm like so are we going to get paid I'm like guys I don't think we're going to pay
[00:44:59] we asked we asked one of them and like are we really you're going to pay me the you know the fee
[00:45:04] yes but that the person said no we're not going to get paid so we just lost three and a thousand
[00:45:08] dollars just because I didn't do that or back in the day I I showed a property in Malibu three times
[00:45:15] and I said I said to the agent you know we should probably get that single party you know a single
[00:45:21] party listing agreement is sure if you're that one listing if that one buyer buys it we get a
[00:45:26] percentage yeah no Ben you know Mr. David doesn't need to he's my best friend for 10 years he would
[00:45:34] never go around me well guess what three months later it's sold for $70 million oh that was a
[00:45:40] $3 million commission got him like oh so oh I didn't realize it was going to happen like that I'm
[00:45:45] just so surprised he didn't call me and like do you remember that conversation we had yeah you
[00:45:50] learn these lessons put things in writing you know and that's why you have like an independent
[00:45:54] contractor agreement right yeah everything you do put in writing and have and sign off on thing
[00:46:00] and then you're going to be you're going to be in a good way and you won't go through arbitration and
[00:46:06] all the stuff the stressful stuff that that bothers you you know we have a lot of our listeners
[00:46:11] on the west coast and obviously we have listeners in everywhere about 95% of our listeners are
[00:46:18] US so we have probably listeners in every state I would hope and so they have clients that maybe
[00:46:26] moving in and out or into you know they may be a feeder market into your area and of course you
[00:46:31] have clients that move out to other areas get second homes you know other properties so you know
[00:46:37] if one of our listeners says oh I I might be able to you know have a synergy with Ben and his team
[00:46:43] and might be able to provide value what's the best way somebody should reach out to you if they
[00:46:48] want to connect with you I think my cell phone is pretty cool or my email Ben at Rebel Real Estate

[00:47:56] what do you look for you have a huge team what what is it because I imagine you do not
[00:48:01] to of course take everyone who comes your way probably very selective but what is it that you
[00:48:06] most look for in an agent I look for I look for someone who is basically everything we're talking
[00:48:18] about in the sense that they're not scattered and they have one directive and when I ask
[00:48:24] them things like where do you think you're going to get your book of business from and and they
[00:48:27] explain like one channel or two channels of what they're going to do and then I leave them
[00:48:33] into seeing what are they actually going to execute execute on on that channel if it's you know
[00:48:39] I think all the thing sorry about that okay it's five we're talking about
[00:48:48] hyper focus yeah the ability to like you said with Titans of Industry the ability to singularly
[00:48:55] sort of say I'm doing this thing and if you want to be on board with me while I do this thing
[00:49:01] you can I'm going to do this thing regardless yeah also just if it's like a culture fit you know
[00:49:06] sure if they're just good people and it's someone that like I feel like it's not going to create any
[00:49:12] any drama in in their in their in their world that is that could impact us just want a positive
[00:49:22] the positive environment that we could all feel like we can make connections and share
[00:49:28] inventory with and nothing is yeah that kind of that kind of thing um I'm looking for a culture fit
[00:49:34] in someone who's go getter motivated and this isn't a part-time job it's a full-time job and then
[00:49:39] and they have a goal what they want to do okay looking to do 10 million this year 12 million how
[00:49:44] you're going to get there and then I'll let them speak and say and and and and dig your own hole

Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.

You could drop right into chat GPT to take your business to the next level. I would appreciate that. Let me know what you think about those videos and let's get right to it. My conversation with Ben Bacall. Angela Bacall. As a piece of advice, S.호 ever received in Real Estate. The best piece of recipe that I ever receive in real estate is you can find 2 ultra high net worth clients and if you can maintain another cant fail this莉 relationships for your career that could set the base for you just to take off forever. Yeah, it makes sense. Oh wow. Definitely excited to hear more about that. Worst piece of advice you ever received in real estate? My geographic farm is more than two areas when I started real estate. It would be divorced. Worst. Meaning you should have only had one or you should have expanded. No, only had like one. Yeah, we're in Chicago. We have 77 neighborhoods just in the city. And you're in L.A. So obviously you have a similar situation there. Pick one of the calls. Is that a job that dominate, right? Yeah, that's right. Ben McCall is my guest today.

BenBacall Estates, we will have links to his website and Instagram in the show notes. Ben, welcome. Thank you for having me. This is cool. Well, it's very cool for me to be able to talk to you because you have a very unique business and a very unique value proposition and it's it's rarefied air to some degree. And I've been doing the show for seven years and I always really love talking to agents that are so highly specialized. But I really want to get back to the beginning of the story or get to the beginning of the story so that our listeners can hear sort of how you started and how you ascended in building your business. So how did you get into real estate? My mother is a broker in Canada and I'd watch her in excruciating pain dealing with her clients and I said I want to live a life of extreme angst and anxiety for the rest of my life. So let me do that for a business like mother likes son. You are at least successful. I love that. Yeah, it is it is funny but entranau is a particularly challenging market. People can't sell their houses there. Yeah, right. Yes. The bubble has burst. Oh boy. Is your mom still practicing? She's not. No, but she she was great. She's she's a good communicator. Maybe that's part of my that's helped me in my trajectory in my career. Yeah, so so you moved out to LA when you were what 17? Yeah, entranau. And then tell us how you how you got involved in real estate. Yeah, I was making movies and going to film school so I wanted to make enough money to buy IP Sure and make sure make make while starting short films and then videos and then I just got addicted to my first deal. I you know after doing you know 30-day escrow and working with closely with the heads of the family it was a small deal. I'm sorry it sounds so grand but just this family that I was working with in Venice Beach. It was so cool that they trusted me and trusted me with this 1.4 million dollar deal in Venice. It was like wow this is cool. I'm 25 years old and I just closed their sale and they're so happy and I got them another property and that felt really um really powerful so that the whole process from you know putting it out there and marketing and negotiations was exciting. So I was like okay I'm gonna stop maybe in the entertainment business. I like I love homes and I love people and um yeah that's how it happened. I was door knocking in Venice Beach. So my my my mother being the agent she goes bad you need to focus on just the low end of the real estate market. This was just right after the you know the bubble burst here in 2008 and my first year real estate I made about I made $394,000 my first year. Amazing. Which I didn't realize how that it was amazing until I own a brokerage and have you know 65 agents and realize how you know determined you one has to be in order to be I hear at your top right so I didn't give up I didn't let my head hit the pillow every night until I probably talked to you know dozens of people and asked hundreds of people during the week if they wanted to sell their home if not thousands. Wow so you were you were literally prospecting just nonstop. Just nonstop and uh I was just like I got to see I can't stop door knocking or call calling until someone says yes that day and then I would and then I would go home and be like okay and then I would be dreaming about the people I'm talking about um thinking who I could who have to call next to follow up with and back then there wasn't really any CRM systems not like that was that long ago 2005 or there was there was like high rise that I used um and they were not that intuitive definitely no no AI at that point no no no machine learning and large language models to like help me you know direct my focus on to different people um but I would lose a lot of deals like oh every every week I'll go on that more specific oh I forgot to look out listed on Noida like I listed on Millwood I knocked on that door I talked to that person and it was like I was beat beat it was always beating myself up because I probably could have made a million dollars that first year I just followed up and had like a proper proper systems in place I mean it's amazing it's like you know you as you think back it's like I shot for the what is the expression I shot for the Sun I landed on the moon you know it's like you still landed pretty pretty far out there like you still had a great year but as you look back you go wow there were a lot of inconsistencies that I could have done even better I want to talk about door knocking for a moment because everyone who's listening who is never doorked probably cringes at the thought of a doork and you know how did you was that something that was easy for you and and curious to know like what your approach was there well you know it's all about your approach like he said it's all about your intention so I often went out with intention of a client that I was actually genuinely looking for so it came from a place of authenticity yeah and it also was very conversational so I'll like take out my agents that I recruit that come to the office even if they've done 50 you know hundred million dollars or maybe they've done ten or twenty they I talk about I talk about door knocking they go will you go door knocking with me and I'm like you're sure I was like yeah I'll come door knocking with you if you promise to go five more times without me and talk to 20 people a day so it's the approach is I go out and I'm it's more conversational you know a walk by a door I saw see it'll look pretty house and unlock I'm like hey just one let you know my client was looking in your neighbor in your house is so gorgeous oh thank you so much yeah like yeah it's how long have you lived here for whatever a couple of years I'm like listen I know maybe probably don't want to but if you ever want to sell I've got a great buyer you totally you love your house I'd love to do yeah and then they'll be like well thank you we're staying here we're leaving feet first I'm like okay no problem if you have any any friends or you know family that want to move in the neighborhood I have a lot of off-market deals and maybe I can get your number and then I'll put my phone out and I'll say what's your number and I'll say it out loud that way they actually give me the number because most of the time they'll say leave your card sure in the mailbox but it's more you know I honestly say with me smiling and matching mirroring how they're reacting to me will create an instant rapport and a trust that will hopefully cultivate into a phone number contact an email follow up and then they become my my friend and they provide them value over the years and they just you know either I provide the value by bringing them up the buyer if they want to make money or if they're not ready you just want to create a relationship sure and not be a pushy salesman so I think I attribute a lot of that door knocking success I wasn't too salesy and I direct to the point that was actually confident even in my early days of what my intention was and what my what I wanted to accomplish and it came off as as as important to listen to me what I had to say to these people there was a day when there wasn't rings anymore so the ring camera doesn't help too much that's true yeah it probably makes it a little a little bit more challenging but what is I want to sort of unpack this a little bit and because I've done 700 of these episodes over the last seven years you're the you might be while my memory is terrible so you might not be the first person that I've ever interviewed for door knocking but let's say you are because I think you actually are and I do want to talk about this because it is an absolute no go for so many people to even consider and the way that you described it by the way what I anticipated you saying before we got to door knocking was well yeah I worked in the entertainment industry I was behind the scenes I was you know with all these production companies and I just kind of leveraged though that network to build by business and you did not say that you said oh I went out and knocked on strangers doors and I was like oh my god how'd you do that and the way that you just explained it made all the sense in the world because it really is kind of a low stakes situation you're not asking for a sale you're not selling a product or even a service you're literally saying oh my I have somebody that is looking in this neighborhood or I just help somebody in this neighborhood I need more homes like yours so when you are ready please call me and it's kind of an easy yes there's not really any commitment they're giving other than wow this person just flattered my property and gave me a nice compliment and also you're a super nice person so that also I don't quite understand the apprehension with getting out there because especially if you live in sunny California you're no excuse most of us sitting at their computer hurting their back although you can get out there and feel the sun it gets some vitamin D and go talk to 20 random people and it doesn't have to be so like door to door to door to door you can just sure how's that you like I listen I doorked and then I elevated my game and I cut my teeth on more expensive properties that's that's also another problem people are so eager to get into the luxury they see like these high-flying ticket items being sold for 20 30 40 and I want to go there it took me like five years to start selling my first six million dollar home some people there's been anomalies that have like gone right to the top and sold 10 20 million dollars within two years but took me a minute but I I built my database so for instance I doorked in I guess it was probably like 2010 and that house was owned by a surgeon medium logo and I stayed in touch with them and I called them you know every year to see if I could bring a buyer he ended up selling the property to a basketball star so I missed that on that sale but I kept on calling and guess what I sold that home last year for 80s for actually 150 million dollars amazing all because I doorked and met that relationship and stayed in touch and yeah you know that's how that's that you know but there's another part of that equation it's it's it's your social etiquette and your emotional maturity yes and if either you had that or you don't you know how to communicate with people and it's not a high pressure situation just the way you talk to people my dad's a psycho manless I come from a family I guess I'm blessed in that sense that I'm fortunate to have grown up and you know a middle-class family in in Canada and I'm surrounded myself with other highly intelligent people that had common sense and courtesy and decency in the world and and and appreciated you know what it is to what it is to have emotions and and be cognizant of other people's feelings and and let people be heard instead of talking at them so it's that like you know it's how people want to communicate and that's why I don't think you know AI is not going to take this whole business away because people want that emotional connection and that's what REALTORS give and they're able to really and it's a huge at stake business you know it's a huge you know it's your it's you often 30 40 percent of people's in that work so they want to be able to talk to somebody right absolutely and I so again I'm just I'm going back to the this approach of the the cold open which is essentially what you're doing and what you're doing is it's it's a very smart play because it is it is for example I live in a condo building so it would be harder for somebody to do this for me in fact we'd have a security issue if somebody was able to knock on my door but the idea of maybe receiving a letter in the mail or or or phone call possibly I'm sure I'm I'm sure my phone numbers out there where and I don't think everybody knows that I have a real estate license I don't use my license so the irony is I don't even use my license but I don't think that's not the reason I'm not getting calls I don't think that's the reason I'm not getting calls and I suspect you know it would be very flattering if somebody said hey I know you moved in five years ago yeah and you're I don't know what your life situation is a buyer real family we have to live yeah I love that way that is it is without letter things came in the the kernel the idea that's a former prospecting sure if you're not door knocking in every day then in your call calling that a letter you can write a letter and you can be very specific about who that that person is right that perfect the personification of that family yeah what seems so it is real and you could say my client's looking for this kind of property which is your property and your address handwritten yeah if you put in that work and handwrite letters that's what your your risk is going to be hurting by the end of the day 100 we're feet are going to be pain and pain from door knocking you're going to be tired again too much you get a bit more sunscreen on your your thirsty you need to go to the bathroom your your through throat is tired you're like done with the rejection that's when you know you're going to be successful yeah and if you're not 10 times better than anyone out there in this business yeah then this is this is a part-time game and that's okay maybe people just you know they want to you know you want to live a life of uncertainty and you don't want to build wealth wealth generation no wealth then that's where you want to be but if you want to be at the top of your game you got to be you have to be 10 times better than everyone else and and there's very few people that's why they say 90% of the business is done by what 10% at the top right because they just they work their tail off you know they're consistent yeah they do I've interviewed some of the very top agents in in the world including your now now adding you to the list as well and I've been doing that for years and and I do ask like what's your secret and usually it's I just I work people you know you got to be you know you can give the gift of the gab be relatable be a kind person smile be confident understand your market know the values and talk to 20 people today and follow up with them it's that's it it's it's it's it's as simple as that and then you have to like get out there and make connections and if you build a good reputation in other agents respect you that is and then you can you'll sell a lot of property that is not on the open market so you can you can you can make you can match you know people to properties and and you can do that at any price point so that's that that's also vital I think relationships building relationships and and I think of one of my sellers who was a broke what sorry one man eat one of my sellers one of my buyers he's a buyer seller he taught me an important lesson he said you know bend this business is about sharing right you want to share so you know if I if someone if I mean interviewed for a listing that expired that's you know maybe you know that's fair game but if you want to work with everyone in your community is agents they're they're your life run right then the buyers and sellers will come but you want to you really want to work closely with other agents and you want to be sharing with them you know a lot at my company revel if I seen agent come in and he is everything that we're talking about he or she they're putting in the effort and they're putting in the work and they're in their consistent and I I will actually put them on my listing and offer them like a service fee so they can build their repertoire of getting to 10 20 million so they have a resume yeah I did that myself I didn't have any it's very generous you do that for me but that's what I do with my company you know you'll see if you go to any one of my listings you'll see me and LA one and LA two which is in in the multiple listing service and I'll tell you just other my people in my office that way they have a resume so sharing is important does that make sense you know sharing not not not not not in that respect just like in the commissions you know of course as a broker we get in the middle you know the commission disputes within the offices you know what's the time who walked through the property and so forth and that's always something fun to navigate but but the idea of you at least putting them on the official listing as LA one and two is really a generous thing I again maybe other people I've interviewed do that I've never heard anybody say they do it with basically every listing especially for you know more junior agents I I can't imagine what that must do to some the loyalty these agents must have for for revel and you know people know this but if they look at them alas they can see they can see that I do that but about but you know you have to be with me for a certain amount you know sure of course to gain to gain that trust or or if I actually see that you're a go-getter right that you know you're a go-getter and you're making that happen and you're closing sales that's much more right because if you're not closing then you pretty much know they're if they're putting in that that 110% right absolutely and I'm sure when you get interviewed you probably get asked questions about celebrities I'm not going to ask you questions about specific celebrities because you know they're just people like us however I am curious is working with celebrities you know a different experience than a you know traditional you know buyer seller do they do are there more masters to serve are there managers and and agents that also are part of the experience or are you working more specifically one-on-one directly with with the celebrity yeah they're definitely not like us they there's an expectation of where I want to be in my head is is trumped everything else so you have to cater to that to that personality and just be mindful the fact that that any request is as amazing as it is you have to cater you have to cater sure with note with note with no opinion yeah it's it's definitely it's it's a bit heart it's not so sexy sure sure it's actually like we're talking about celebrity like fame like actor spin-fluencer that that kind of thing it's it's it's it's interesting but it's fun I mean they're great people and you can there was a reason why like when you're around them like they're the some of some they're the presence that they it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's it's also hard work you know yeah well it's you it's especially with some celebrities that just have that that garner a high price point for for their acting or or music services or whatever in entertainment they're doing is they are getting catered to and they have a lot of people surrounding them that are going to help them throughout their day and you're right they're probably you know and it's not that that there's anything wrong with this they're just used to being able to get things and having other people do those assignments because that's their world and I imagine you having to step into that world is is is yeah but probably a bit of a a challenge initially is like okay now I'm I'm part of this team and I get to to do some of the the the the actions that maybe other non-selebrities will think to ask me there's some like like you mentioned that Damon when when we were showing property to him he would how a whole conversation with like the Butler for the maid in the house like for like I believe I was mad he's over there he's like having a 10 minute conversation like just so and so you just appreciate himself and he's just a guy of gratitude so warm and loving yeah and the flip side of that you clients that are all of them are really like that but then the day you know they look at you as a purpose to make things happen sure and if they feel like you know you're taking advantage or you're you're you're you're done yeah pretty quickly you know because they deal with that all the time people do try to take advantage they do try to you know a glamon or or get something from them and they probably are constantly evaluating is this person with me because they authentically like me as an individual and they want to help me or they want to be my friend or are they with me because I'm you know popular and and and and mouth well to do so yeah they probably have a very tuned in sense of that and you being as authentic as you are probably are our breath of fresh air for you know sometimes these these people might have to meet other I guess I bet they're just constantly evaluating because this person really want to want to help me or are they one to help themselves. Celebrities like you know not not just like TV personalities but like heads of industry I consider those in my mind celebrities and I'm you know equally as like in awe and nervous around you know you know for all these years you know showing Jeff Bezos a house he wasn't my client but you know I showed him a couple of houses and he'd been in his presence was pretty cool and the head of you know different social networks that you know the mate when they came around I was like okay this guy like is like the 30th richest person in the world the 10 richest person world the power that they yield is is is pretty cool that they're asking they're looking at me and they're asking me some questions that I have to their pivotal to his to his calculation so that's it that's that's kind of wild right. Well especially like a Jeff Bezos who's so so intelligent when it comes to finance and business obviously right so we all know this and I that would be tremendously intimidating I suspect because but there are things he doesn't know and that's why you're there and obviously for him to look at you is. No it's everything but like other people yeah I mean they all know everything they have everything at their fingertips but what you're bringing to them is is the opportunity of or her the opportunity of properties there are not maybe on the market. I'm actually a new agent that's a good way to like really get in there is by putting in the hard work and finding inventory because that's what our business is all about she's really finding inventory and and and trying to get in contract to exclusives to sell that inventory and then connect in the dots. You you have a really unique sort of insight into these titans of industry and you you know you work with celebrities but you also work with people who are you know in the business world at at the top of of their respective fields and I suspect over time you've probably learned a lot as well about either running your own business or just navigating life or doing things more effectively I suspect in addition to obviously being an incredibly effective agent you've probably just learned from these people just being around them and watching them operate. I did learn I guess a big lesson that I've learned and I'm when I've learned over time is to stay super focused on one one one bit one core business to be successful I think that's important you know so and I have deviated from that because I'm an entrepreneur entrepreneur at heart and it's bitten me you know distracted me but it has also opened up opportunities to meet other entrepreneurs to have those conversations to be able to have those conversations with tech founders and and glean from them and understand their business and what they're up against and what their stress points are so all that it's it's been a life I went to basically I wanted to I did my own business school you know yeah you know it cost me a lot of money but I went to business school and I paid for it and I learned my I learned my own you know my own P&L and how to work that yeah I it boy it's so so interesting that you just the access you have to these people really helps you probably sharpen your skills because number one you have to have sharp really sharp tools to be able to provide service to these individuals but also they have sharp tools in their own respective fields and you get to sort of see them operate I think that wow what a what a what a cool honestly the the coolest part of this business is the fact that I when I'm Brad presenting these these kinds of the industry and I get to hear about what they're doing day to day in the in the way that they created their legacy it's just so it's so wild it's so cool it's like it's like real life chapters are reading reading these amazing biographies of these people in a real life you know when they tell you what they're doing and then I asked them how did you get there and the word you start and it's the stories are so cool you know now this podcast all over that that when you can watch these people do the same thing but it was it's great to like be next to them in real life and you're instead of going on a million you're right beside them and that and that's and that's pretty cool I love that that singular focus suggestion that that you you gave is really so important it the science and and the data's in we cannot multitask whether it's you know doing just a little to-do's during the day or whether it's focusing on our business or whatever projects we're we're into yeah well I I have I have ADD so I'm wondering if the people you've interviewed do a lot of them at like the sex successful agent on ADD on almost all of them right there you go so you know I'm pretty focused on other questions you're asking me but as you're talking to me I'm as you're talking with me I'm thinking of like 10 few other things in my head but what that's an aim of me to do is put them down or execute on everything really quickly so instead of just doing one task I can't execute a multiple task sure or at least write them down so I will execute my mind's always so I'm much of a that's called mop I tasking so yeah I as far as you're doing it in the same field you know you're not doing it like all different things but yeah I'm I mean it's it's interesting how much we're able to to execute during the day and I think AI 100% I use that in my it streamlines everything like I used to my big part of my success um was writing a comparative market analysis for my clients understand why am I paying 20 million when the highest sale in the neighborhood was 10 right and I took full comps and do this and then write explanations so now you can be like you can say an inaudible to five sentences that make somewhat of a sense some reason AI understands me and they're able to like boom and I can send a message right or or if I have an idea of like why I'm convincing someone of an opportunity or you can AI will will help navigate that or where I should be going during the day let's quicker um it's uh it's it's helpful to streamline things and make you just go you your time is is money right yeah getting your time right and you want to be prospecting so as much as that is possible do you have a particular structure to your day and is it I understand your days probably look wildly different from one another but in general do you have a structure that is consistent yeah it's it's working out every five to six days a week in the morning and it's spending time with my dog so um he's happy and that gives me some happiness and love so I do that um and then I'm head to the office to follow up with the thousands of people that I have built over the years that's my goal we're just talking to people all day long because something clicks and then obviously there's uh there's showings that I have to go to I'm off I'm I'm lucky by getting listings and putting on my agent's onto being LA1 or two to help service the deal so they can open the house for me and get it ready and I show up and I can my help solve that house and then I'm back at networking and people are everyone who I pushed out against the what I mean push out what I want that I reached out to will start texting me back and that's a fault talk to all those people and then it's just ransom repeat it's very repetitive it's tedious and but it's consistency and and and I think I know in life when things are monotonous and the same you're actually happier so if you create a hundred each day no matter how you know boring it is and I've done it then it's good to you know I go to Europe for once a year for three weeks and I detach and then I come back rejuvenated and ready to go but I wasn't doing that for so long for me for ten years I was just working straight but didn't take any vacations at all sure you refuse to until I can go first class that's well hey that's a great marker and I think the consistency is it's it's the fundamentals right where we're talking fundamentals we're talking the boring repetitive tasks the the push-ups of real estate so to speak that nobody like I don't want to do a wall sit but it's a really good idea for my legs and I was doing them yesterday and I was you know it's just in the middle of a wall sit this isometric exercise that by the end of it my legs are shaking and I just I just want to collapse and I go oh I only have another five seconds or my trainers telling me I have another five seconds and I'm like I can't do another five seconds and then I I get to that end and then I then I collapse and I think yeah well it's funny because I think this is the least fun thing I could possibly be doing right now the outcome of it means you're going to be more mobile as you get older yes and you'll be able to appreciate enjoy life in your in your later years and your goals in your golden ages you'd be more and I'm I'm pushing against resistance which is good for my mind it's good for my body obviously good for my muscles but more important than anything is I'm doing the hard good thing right and that's what you are talking about is doing the hard good things that maybe they're not sexy and fun sometimes they might be but but often they're they're repetitive they're monotonous but they work and and on top of that then now to align ourselves to a different triangle of success we've talked about consistency doing things that are difficult for you pushing to all that all that and all that stuff that gets you there but then you want to align yourself with that's with someone who has done it right yes that's why there's teams people are so gravitating towards all these teams these days because if you're a new agent or if you're been in the business you know I'm a new for for five ten years it's good to leverage other people's success and have them in your corner in case you need to lean on them to to to get that listing and that's a big part of my my business um back in the day when I went for my first listing I brought in top agents and it was better to get 50% of something than nothing and a lot big mistake I see new agents here there's you know I've hired agents and and I'm like okay I can come to the listing with you like you just doorknob to met or a call call then I see I talked to this guy I talked to this guy my great set that meeting up and then they don't and and then they they're they fail they're out of the business because they're so like hoarding their their chestnuts and yes what I said at the beginning it's about sharing it's about leveraging so you know team up with a top agent like myself come to my office I will I'm your business partner don't go be a business partner with another new newbie agent because that agent is willing to go door not to with you because you don't have the you don't have it in you to do it go do it yourself and team up with the top agent who's high at a higher level than you yeah higher higher vibrations higher level to to get to get those listings because you don't have a resume so that's important that's that's important to do and that's that's why everyone is gravitate towards teams but it becomes a bit of a crutch after a while if you're just doing a team thing for years and years and years but again that brings me back to like how far do you want to go if you want to be two times better than everybody else five times it's 10 times 10 times means you're a millionaire five times means you're going to be making you'll be breaking even or you in life you know and you every day right it's going to be a struggle depends where you want to be you know so does that make sense yeah that's what you know I did that in my early years I and I teamed up big and today you'll look on listings and sometimes I'll have to bring in another top agent because I know I'm competing against you know someone who's sold 10 8 billion and I need to bring in another guys and four three so it measures up right so it's about sharing you know we don't need all of them you just want to like get the notches on the belt to have success so you can you can the more signs you have out on on the street the more you're going to get hired it's just visibility right there's a brain agent and in Venice Beach and that agent takes all of the listings throughout all of Los Angeles and puts for signs that it looks like she monopolizes like the area like 30 signs everywhere she did some of these signs are like these listings are probably in another state but it's all about perception right right I even I even give my Bentley uh car to my agents to drive go to a listing appointment so they want to have you know they don't want me to go in the car they should have me go I let them drive yeah I know I like whatever it takes right I think yeah there's there's a persistency but this idea of not seeing a finite amount of opportunity like you don't see finite you see infinite and you you're not worried about sharing because there's other opportunities that will come as a result of sharing and the the givers get mentality if I give I get and that is obviously served you incredibly well and so much of us want to fix manage and control the the things that are within our purview and nope nope I don't want anyone to touch those chestnuts and you're right it's a mistake it well it I guess it's not a mistake if you're not willing to see the world as infinite if you if you see the world is there's only a finite amount of resources then yeah I guess maybe you should hoard them but that's not really the pathway to success and or at least not maybe the best pathway to success so I think you need to do that and you need to get things in writing because often people are not held to you know everything in writing it's like yes you're like I am going to go do an open house just with you with you and sit the open house what does it look like if a fire walks through the door yeah because in our business there's so many like nuances like where did that person derive from and who worked the hardest on a deal and and when you call list of properties not about like who worked the hardest about getting a listing and being being a partnership because you all bring in your strengths here and there but putting things in writing is vital and really smart and yeah you have to you have to do that otherwise you're going to be left with absolutely nothing you know I put a gale together one of my agents and I was like we need to get saying in writing and I'm like no no no this happens so many times but I got so pretty much a Europe and we put the put the deal together it's a 15 million dollar development deal and we're supposed to get a fee for putting them together they're now together and of course I'm like so are we going to get paid I'm like guys I don't think we're going to pay we asked we asked one of them and like are we really you're going to pay me the you know the fee yes but that the person said no we're not going to get paid so we just lost three and a thousand dollars just because I didn't do that or back in the day I I showed a property in Malibu three times and I said I said to the agent you know we should probably get that single party you know a single party listing agreement is sure if you're that one listing if that one buyer buys it we get a percentage yeah no Ben you know Mr. David doesn't need to he's my best friend for 10 years he would never go around me well guess what three months later it's sold for $70 million oh that was a $3 million commission got him like oh so oh I didn't realize it was going to happen like that I'm just so surprised he didn't call me and like do you remember that conversation we had yeah you learn these lessons put things in writing you know and that's why you have like an independent contractor agreement right yeah everything you do put in writing and have and sign off on thing and then you're going to be you're going to be in a good way and you won't go through arbitration and all the stuff the stressful stuff that that bothers you you know we have a lot of our listeners on the west coast and obviously we have listeners in everywhere about 95% of our listeners are US so we have probably listeners in every state I would hope and so they have clients that maybe moving in and out or into you know they may be a feeder market into your area and of course you have clients that move out to other areas get second homes you know other properties so you know if one of our listeners says oh I I might be able to you know have a synergy with Ben and his team and might be able to provide value what's the best way somebody should reach out to you if they want to connect with you I think my cell phone is pretty cool or my email Ben at Rebel Real Estate let's start there Ben at Rebel Real Estate perfect calm so that's BEN and then at our Rebel Real Estate calm also if you're in town when you're in Beverly Hills and in that platinum triangle area we're 93 20 Wilshire Boulevard and you see a Rebel Real Estate sign with a 5000 square feet the gorgeous office break by Brodale Wilshire so I hope to see you with me doing a great coffee meet I pride myself on my coffee and very I'm a coffee snob so time to have a couple coffee and stop in I'd like to or take a stroll down to Beverly or a day and we'll get a coffee together if there's any listeners of ours who are agents in your area and maybe another firm who are really liking what they're hearing and thinking I want to earn a spot on on the Rebel Real Estate team you know what's the best way they should go about saying hey I I have I have something of value to offer you and and how could they did you reach out as well via email that we great Ben at Rebel Real Estate calm what do you look for you have a huge team what what is it because I imagine you do not to of course take everyone who comes your way probably very selective but what is it that you most look for in an agent I look for I look for someone who is basically everything we're talking about in the sense that they're not scattered and they have one directive and when I ask them things like where do you think you're going to get your book of business from and and they explain like one channel or two channels of what they're going to do and then I leave them into seeing what are they actually going to execute execute on on that channel if it's you know I think all the thing sorry about that okay it's five we're talking about hyper focus yeah the ability to like you said with Titans of Industry the ability to singularly sort of say I'm doing this thing and if you want to be on board with me while I do this thing you can I'm going to do this thing regardless yeah also just if it's like a culture fit you know sure if they're just good people and it's someone that like I feel like it's not going to create any any drama in in their in their in their world that is that could impact us just want a positive the positive environment that we could all feel like we can make connections and share inventory with and nothing is yeah that kind of that kind of thing um I'm looking for a culture fit in someone who's go getter motivated and this isn't a part-time job it's a full-time job and then and they have a goal what they want to do okay looking to do 10 million this year 12 million how you're going to get there and then I'll let them speak and say and and and and dig your own hole if they're if they're if they're good sensible people with that are rational and thoughtful and mindful and uh have a curious emotional intelligence to to and also that they have thick skin because it's it's a top business you know I'm sure in a role to punch us here right no don't take anything personally in the beginning my career trick things so personally but you know I learned about I learned many lessons you know but um then also just to be kind and and and um and sharing right I mean all those all those things that's what I look for you know tenacious people I would love also you know I'm looking at a meeting agents that are that are that have done 20 30 in a trumpet they've been there are 30 million they want to get to 100 million and they're like why can't I get past this point sure I am really good at explaining what you need to do to get there and and and to create those systems and to direct redirect your focus and bring in other help to get there and I'm an our bi-company can facilitate that help in order for people to be be a rainmaker more every day in their career so those agents that are at 30 they're trying to they're trying to get up or 20 million they're at 10 million and they can't get past that point I provide coaching myself um and if they listen I provide more coaching if they execute them when I'm telling them I continue because it's you know it's going to help my business bring in more more inventory and more sales right I love it Ben Becaul is our guest and he has not he himself being one of the top real estate agents um REALTORS in in the world really also of course here in the US uh
