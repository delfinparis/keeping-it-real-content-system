[00:01:22] And now on to our show.
[00:01:38] Hi everyone, this is Aaron Helly with Good Grow With Me segment.
[00:01:43] We are talking about business, wealth and health.
[00:01:46] And today I have an awesome episode for you all about seller financing and loan assumptions.
[00:01:53] Before we jump in, let's do what we always do.
[00:01:56] We're going to recap what we talked about last episode.
[00:01:59] So we talked about calculating your income goal.
[00:02:02] Maybe you call it your financial freedom number.
[00:02:04] The number that you need to make on a monthly basis to feel successful as a REALTOR and
[00:02:10] as a business owner.
[00:02:11] So you looked at all your monthly expenses.
[00:02:14] You looked at all the things you have to take care of and then all the things you want
[00:02:18] to do and attain it, vacations, things like that.
[00:02:22] And then you figured out what that dollar amount is and set a goal to make that money each
[00:02:27] month.
[00:02:28] And then you backward this plan from there to figure out how much activity and how many
[00:02:33] things you needed to do as in signing buyers, getting listing agreements, closing transactions
[00:02:40] to make that dollar amount.
[00:02:41] And then hopefully you took it a step further and you put all those plans in place and
[00:02:46] took some action and your honor way to your financial freedom number or your income goal.
[00:02:53] Again, as usual, always share with me what you're working on.
[00:02:57] I want to hear from you, email me, find me on Instagram.
[00:03:00] I want to know, I want to chat with you about it.
[00:03:03] So let's dive into seller financing and loan assumptions and why this matters to you.
[00:03:13] And but I'm going to start with why this matters to me because this week I was supposed
[00:03:17] to close on the sale of a triplex that I own in another state.
[00:03:23] 45 days ago, I had a buyer submit an offer through my REALTOR.
[00:03:28] I used a REALTOR, I referred myself to that REALTOR.
[00:03:31] So I get a cut of her commission and she found a buyer also represented by another REALTOR.
[00:03:39] Who wanted me to sell her finance this property?
[00:03:43] So I'm financing $75,000 worth of a property worth about $150,000.
[00:03:51] So what that looks like for the buyer, the buyer is coming in purchasing for 150.
[00:03:57] And I'm financing 75,000, which means that they have to come up with another $75,000 to bring to closing.
[00:04:06] Plus any other cost they agreed to in their offer.
[00:04:13] So there's a couple ways that you can do this.
[00:04:15] They can borrow that $75,000 from somebody else or they can come up with cash.
[00:04:22] The problem with borrowing it is that me as a seller per our contract,
[00:04:28] I want to be in first lean position, which means that my loan gets paid off first before any other loan, any other lean.
[00:04:38] So if the buyer defaults and we have to foreclose, my loan takes priority.
[00:04:46] Or if the buyer ends up having like a short sale and they have two leans on the property, mine would get covered first.
[00:04:54] Hopefully and it's for entirety, but the bulk of the money that the buyer would bring would come to me if I agreed to let them do a short sale.
[00:05:02] But bottom line is leans matter, lean positions matter and typically when you get a loan on a property, that loan is going to be in first lean position.
[00:05:17] And when you get like a HELOC or a subsequent loan, that's going to go into second lean position.
[00:05:23] So a HELOC is a home equity line of credit.
[00:05:25] So that is subsequent to the original mortgage. So if you have a HELOC and you default and you declare bankruptcy, maybe you don't have enough money to pay off the HELOC when you sell the house.
[00:05:39] But the first the loan that gets paid off first is the primary mortgage.
[00:05:44] And then maybe the HELOC gets paid off second if there's enough, but the HELOC would never get paid off before the primary home loan.
[00:05:52] Okay, so hopefully you understand why lean position matters and why me as the seller would not accept a second lean position, especially in this case, where my loan is half of the value of the property, they could potentially be getting a second loan for the same amount of money.
[00:06:14] So I asked this question up front because I had a feeling that we might come down this to this to the end, just like we are, and then we wouldn't be able to close because they were trying to get a loan on the down payment and that lender wouldn't be okay with my loan taking priority over theirs.
[00:06:33] And just as I suspected, that's exactly what happened, despite assurance it's from both REALTORS that this wouldn't happen.
[00:06:41] So what happened essentially my REALTOR who is said over and over again, I don't know anything about this.
[00:06:48] Just cross your fingers and hoped that this would just magically work out the other REALTOR didn't understand lean positions and didn't understand why having two loans or two lenders would even matter in the closing.
[00:07:06] But hopefully you can see right now it does very much matter and if I'm not taking first lean position, I'm not selling this property to this buyer.
[00:07:17] Okay, so I clarified all this up front didn't get a didn't have a good feeling about it, honestly, didn't put a ton of stake in this, but now that we're really close to closing or should be closing both REALTORS are freaking out, but they've kind of created the situation because of their lack of understanding.
[00:07:35] And that's why I want to make sure that you guys are equipped and understand these terms and these opportunities for your buyers and sellers, but if you don't understand them and you can't educate your buyers and sellers on them, they're going to become liabilities and not opportunities.
[00:07:52] Okay, so let's start with defining seller financing.
[00:07:59] So seller financing is basically when the seller of the property provides financing to the buyer, so they basically become the bank.
[00:08:08] And you can come up with any terms that you want, whatever the loan amount is, whatever the interest rate is, whatever the term is, how the loan is amortized is all negotiable between the buyer and the seller and you as the REALTOR have to help them navigate that, which means you've got to bust out an amortization.
[00:08:26] And schedule an amortization calculator mortgage calculator so you can help your buyer or your seller figure out what those monthly payments are going to be, which again requires an understanding of this whole process. Okay, so.
[00:08:40] The seller is going to have the mortgage and the note recorded so that those are, you know, recorded documents so that if the buyer does default, they do have some recourse and then they can potentially take the property back or do whatever they need to do to become made whole if the buyer default.
[00:09:06] Okay, so what are the benefits here for the sellers and buyers? These can typically lead to quicker transactions because there's a lot less underwriting, typically with the seller just being an individual, it's, it's just less bureaucratic more flexibility and your buyer pool is expanded, which could be good could be bad.
[00:09:27] It's a little bit better when you're looking at investment properties because you can essentially look at the performance of the property and you want to make sure that that income can cover the mortgage.
[00:09:40] As opposed to primary residents where you're relying on the borrower, the buyer who's going to live in there to make enough money to cover that mortgage. So the two are not always the same. So you have to do a little bit of vetting.
[00:09:52] A little bit of due diligence on your part as the seller or as the REALTORS, the seller, the REALTOR for the seller to make sure that they understand all these implications and understand that you need to get a good qualified borrower buyer to make this happen. Okay.
[00:10:09] So where this works, the seller ultimately has to have equity. So the reason I'm able to finance $75,000 to my buyer is because I owe less than that on the mortgage.
[00:10:24] If I owe $100,000 on the mortgage and I sold it and they only brought me $75,000 as a down payment, it's not going to cover what I owe on the mortgage, which means the seller myself has to bring money to closing and have to bring $25,000 to closing plus fees.
[00:10:41] So that's not really ideal. It works better if the seller has equity or doesn't like owns the property outright and doesn't have a mortgage at all. That's the best case scenario. But there needs to be room here. You can't have a seller own a house for 400,000, oh 350 on it.
[00:11:01] And then mortgage the entire 400.
[00:11:08] Because their loan is better scenario for that is a assumption of that mortgage, which we'll talk about here in a minute.
[00:11:15] Okay, so it's important to that legal consultation is happening between the buyers with the buyers and the sellers make sure that all of this stuff is done legally.
[00:11:35] And what they're doing both are globally, so to add to the data that we document.
[00:11:40] Number two.
[00:11:40] The fact that bottom line is that they've clients that you've had the entire buyer make sure that they are free of charge and they can make usual stream ore throw up.
[00:11:54] And again, they can really because it's a nice�ongue and that you've got a couple of of phone numbers online and you can, if you don't know why you're setting up the rent, instead, you're going to have a backend to address the video.
[00:11:59] to more properties and at higher price points than maybe they qualified for and it's an opportunity for
[00:12:07] your seller they're having trouble selling the property. Okay, so let's move to
[00:12:14] assumable mortgages. An assumable mortgage allows a home buyer to not just move into the
[00:12:21] house but to step into the seller's loan. So the remaining balance on the loan, the repayment schedule
[00:12:30] and the rate will be taken over by the new owner. This is really great when mortgage rates are high.
[00:12:36] It makes these transactions really attractive to buyers because they could save thousands of
[00:12:42] dollars by taking over the home loan at an interest rate way below what the current market is offering.
[00:12:50] So typically only government backed mortgages, ones that are backed by the federal housing
[00:12:56] administration can qualify as assumable mortgages. So that's the one in this process. If you're
[00:13:02] representing a seller and you want to see if they can sell their house with a mortgage assumption,
[00:13:08] you need to first verify that the mortgage is assumable. They just need to ask their lender that
[00:13:14] or reference their promise or a no in their loan documentation. It will state it right in there.
[00:13:20] So the buyer is going to take on the home's remaining debt but they're also going to have to cover
[00:13:29] the difference between the mortgage balance and the home's current value. This needs to be in cash
[00:13:35] or a second mortgage. But we already talked about the complications of a second mortgage and
[00:13:40] lean positions. So when you're helping a buyer find this down payment or the difference between
[00:13:47] the mortgage balance and the current value, you need to make sure that the lenders you're
[00:13:51] speaking with understand the structure of the deal and know that they're going to be in second
[00:13:57] lean position subsequent to the primary mortgage on the property. Okay. So let's talk about what this
[00:14:04] looks like. Let's say you have a seller who wants to sell their house. It's again, let's worth $400,000
[00:14:13] and they want to sell it for $400,000 and their mortgage balance is $350,000. Let's say they have a great
[00:14:23] rate. Let's say they're at 2.75% and the best the buyer can get is 7%. Just as an example.
[00:14:31] So the buyer is going to be really interested in this deal because they're going to save so much
[00:14:37] money and interest because they're going to get this great interest rate. So they're going to
[00:14:41] make an offer for $400,000 assuming the loan but they have to cover that $50,000 difference because
[00:14:47] they're going to take over the mortgage balance which is $350,000 but the price of the home is $400,000.
[00:14:53] So that $50,000 difference has to be covered in cash or has to be a second mortgage or a loan
[00:15:01] that will be in second lean position because that money will have to be brought to closing.
[00:15:06] And the seller nets that at closing after everyone's fees and commissions are paid.
[00:15:12] Okay. Other things you need to know about consumable mortgages. They take a long time. I've never seen
[00:15:20] an assumable mortgage or a loan assumption take place unless the 90 days and that's a
[00:15:26] awesome timeline. You're going to plan for like six to seven months in more cases and this is
[00:15:32] primarily because the lender doesn't really make any money off of this. There's no new origination fee.
[00:15:38] They are just going through the wickets of transferring this over and they're going to take their
[00:15:43] sweet time. Communication's going to be tough. Promise you. But that's where you as the REALTOR
[00:15:48] manage expectations. Make sure everybody's aware this is going to take a really long time.
[00:15:53] Get the initial timeline estimate from the lender and communicate that. Make sure both sides are
[00:15:58] tracking and make sure that that's just an estimated closing date and it's probably going to be delayed.
[00:16:04] So and just get them to buckle up and be patient. That's the hardest part. Communication with the
[00:16:09] lender is going to be hard and a lot of times it's going to have to be the seller doing that
[00:16:14] communication because their name is on the loan and you as the REALTOR might be limited
[00:16:19] with how much information you can get directly from the seller. So paint that picture up front.
[00:16:25] Make sure that everyone understands that. Make sure that you understand that so that you can
[00:16:29] have a very successful closing and everyone can be happy in the end. Okay. So your challenge
[00:16:38] from this episode is to educate your buyers. Any buyer that you have in your pipeline right now,
[00:16:44] maybe you have an agreement with them, maybe you're trying to get an agreement with them,
[00:16:47] explain to them these options, which are great right now. I'm recording this in May of 2024
[00:16:54] when rates are still pretty high. So this is a great opportunity for your buyers to find properties
[00:17:00] that they can assume the loan on and get a lower interest rate. It's very, very compelling
[00:17:05] and appealing to them. So go and educate your buyers on that. Then look at your listings and
[00:17:11] any potential listings and figure out whether your seller can offer a seller financing or can have
[00:17:17] the buyer assume their loan and work it out in your head. Make sure you have this prepared for what
[00:17:23] this is going to look like. Figure out the mortgage balance with the properties worth what that
[00:17:27] Delta is. Explain this to your seller. Explain to them how they can take advantage of this opportunity
[00:17:34] and showcase your knowledge. Show them what you know and how you are here to create solutions
[00:17:40] for your buyers and sellers and also for their sellers and buyers. This is about creating a
[00:17:46] solution that works for everybody. Okay. So that's it. Get out there, get after it. Make this
[00:17:53] challenge happen. Let me know how it goes and I will see you next time. This is Erin Helle with
[00:17:58] Grow With Me. We just talked about business, wealth and health. I'll see you guys soon. Bye.

And today I have an awesome episode for you all about seller financing and loan assumptions. Before we jump in, let's do what we always do. We're going to recap what we talked about last episode.

So the buyer is going to take on the home's remaining debt but they're also going to have to cover the difference between the mortgage balance and the home's current value. This needs to be in cash or a second mortgage. But we already talked about the complications of a second mortgage and lean positions. So when you're helping a buyer find this down payment or the difference between the mortgage balance and the current value, you need to make sure that the lenders you're speaking with understand the structure of the deal and know that they're going to be in second lean position subsequent to the primary mortgage on the property. Okay. So let's talk about what this looks like. Let's say you have a seller who wants to sell their house. It's again, let's worth $400,000 and they want to sell it for $400,000 and their mortgage balance is $350,000. Let's say they have a great rate. Let's say they're at 2.75% and the best the buyer can get is 7%. Just as an example. So the buyer is going to be really interested in this deal because they're going to save so much money and interest because they're going to get this great interest rate. So they're going to make an offer for $400,000 assuming the loan but they have to cover that $50,000 difference because they're going to take over the mortgage balance which is $350,000 but the price of the home is $400,000. So that $50,000 difference has to be covered in cash or has to be a second mortgage or a loan that will be in second lean position because that money will have to be brought to closing. And the seller nets that at closing after everyone's fees and commissions are paid. Okay. Other things you need to know about consumable mortgages. They take a long time. I've never seen an assumable mortgage or a loan assumption take place unless the 90 days and that's a awesome timeline. You're going to plan for like six to seven months in more cases and this is primarily because the lender doesn't really make any money off of this. There's no new origination fee. They are just going through the wickets of transferring this over and they're going to take their sweet time. Communication's going to be tough. Promise you. But that's where you as the REALTOR manage expectations. Make sure everybody's aware this is going to take a really long time. Get the initial timeline estimate from the lender and communicate that. Make sure both sides are tracking and make sure that that's just an estimated closing date and it's probably going to be delayed. So and just get them to buckle up and be patient. That's the hardest part. Communication with the lender is going to be hard and a lot of times it's going to have to be the seller doing that communication because their name is on the loan and you as the REALTOR might be limited with how much information you can get directly from the seller. So paint that picture up front. Make sure that everyone understands that. Make sure that you understand that so that you can have a very successful closing and everyone can be happy in the end. Okay. So your challenge from this episode is to educate your buyers. Any buyer that you have in your pipeline right now, maybe you have an agreement with them, maybe you're trying to get an agreement with them, explain to them these options, which are great right now. I'm recording this in May of 2024 when rates are still pretty high. So this is a great opportunity for your buyers to find properties that they can assume the loan on and get a lower interest rate. It's very, very compelling and appealing to them. So go and educate your buyers on that. Then look at your listings and any potential listings and figure out whether your seller can offer a seller financing or can have the buyer assume their loan and work it out in your head. Make sure you have this prepared for what this is going to look like. Figure out the mortgage balance with the properties worth what that Delta is. Explain this to your seller. Explain to them how they can take advantage of this opportunity and showcase your knowledge. Show them what you know and how you are here to create solutions for your buyers and sellers and also for their sellers and buyers. This is about creating a solution that works for everybody. Okay. So that's it. Get out there, get after it. Make this challenge happen. Let me know how it goes and I will see you next time. This is Erin Helle with Grow With Me. We just talked about business, wealth and health. I'll see you guys soon. Bye.
