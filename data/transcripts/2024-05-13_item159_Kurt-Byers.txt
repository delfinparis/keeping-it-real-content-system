[00:02:15] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate
[00:02:21] agents and for real estate agents.
[00:02:22] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:02:24] I'm your guide and host through the guide and host through the show.
[00:02:29] And at just a moment, we're going to be speaking with Kurt Biers about a great opportunity
[00:02:33] for you when you find investors that you're not sure what to do with.
[00:02:37] Before we get to Kurt, just a couple of quick reminders.
[00:02:39] First, the way you can always help us continue to grow.
[00:02:42] Tell a friend about this show.
[00:02:44] This is a tough year in real estate.
[00:02:46] REALTOR's things are changing.
[00:02:47] Buyer representations changing.
[00:02:49] Agents are scared and hopefully this podcast can help through that journey.
[00:02:54] So please tell another agent about us and let's keep everyone productive and positive this
[00:02:58] year so you can even have your best year ever.
[00:03:01] And also, please check out our sponsors.
[00:03:03] We love our sponsors.

[00:03:07] So give their products and services a try.
[00:03:10] We only select sponsors that we know have services and products that can benefit your
[00:03:15] practice.
[00:03:16] Guys, let's just get right into it.
[00:03:18] You've heard enough of me and let's talk to Kurt Biers.
[00:03:35] Today on the show, my guest is Kurt Biers with New Western.
[00:03:40] Let me tell you more about Kurt.
[00:03:41] Now Kurt Biers is the head of brokerage partnerships at New Western where he manages the national
[00:03:47] and regional partnerships across their 40 plus markets.
[00:03:51] He's grown partnership deal revenue year over year by 77% and has added 1000 new leads to
[00:03:58] his agents monthly pipelines.
[00:04:00] His current focus is scaling New Western's recently launched podium program to all 40
[00:04:05] markets with 10,000 partner real estate agents.
[00:04:08] Kurt has been at New Western for only about a year but he wasn't always in real estate.
[00:04:13] He began with a speech language pathology degree working with kids with special needs.
[00:04:17] In 2016, then moved into growth strategy, sales and marketing roles at both startups and
[00:04:23] Fortune 500 companies with sectors including healthcare, product development, beer sales.
[00:04:29] By the way, I've been in healthcare, product development and beer sales as well.
[00:04:32] You know, university research labs and golf technology, those two I've not done.
[00:04:38] Relationship building transcends industries so moving into something he already loved like
[00:04:42] real estate was the perfect transition.
[00:04:44] Please learn more about Kurt's company Kurt works with.

[00:05:04] in Instagram, Facebook, find them and they've got really great content in social.
[00:05:08] Kurt, welcome to the show.
[00:05:10] Thank you.
[00:05:10] Yeah, I'm happy to be here.
[00:05:11] I'm excited.
[00:05:12] I'm excited too.
[00:05:13] We so rarely have investor companies or investor agents on just because there's so many podcasts
[00:05:22] already that service those consumers but our listeners are rather our agents who want to learn
[00:05:32] about investments and what to do when they come across a client and maybe the agent
[00:05:36] themselves doesn't have a lot of skill in that area or doesn't really know how to handle those
[00:05:41] clients sort of understanding their needs as well as what to do.
[00:05:46] So I love that you guys have a solution for that.
[00:05:49] But before we dive into that, let's talk about you and your background.
[00:05:52] So you've done a lot of different things as I was mentioning in the past.
[00:05:56] What brought you into the new Western?
[00:05:58] Yeah, so I was living in Tampa with my wife and three kids and one of my best friends here,
[00:06:06] Seth Mitchell.
[00:06:08] He has been here since college and I've never heard anything but good things about new Western.
[00:06:13] And so he sent me the role for Partnership Manager and he thought it would be a really good fit
[00:06:19] with the company and my career growth.
[00:06:22] And so I applied and just never looked back and it's been, it really has been the perfect fit.
[00:06:27] I've been able to use a lot of what I've learned in the past about relationships and scaling partners
[00:06:32] and looking at the ways to market certain things to different people.
[00:06:36] And it just kind of was it all fell into place and it's been really good ever since.
[00:06:42] I'm very thankful that I got here.
[00:06:44] Great. Well, tell us what New Western is.
[00:06:47] Yeah, so New Western is a real estate investment marketplace.
[00:06:50] We have over 200,000 investors actively buying and selling from us in our 40 plus markets.
[00:06:57] We have been around since 2008 and we've done over 17 billion in transactions.
[00:07:02] So we are always buying, we're always selling, we're always looking for new people to work with.
[00:07:08] And in each of our markets, we have that individual brokerage office.
[00:07:13] So we're very much a boots on the ground investment company versus some that tend to lean towards
[00:07:19] algorithms. We really have local agents ready to give you a cash offer, but that cash offer will
[00:07:26] come with an in-person meeting talking through investment strategy is what types of houses to look for.
[00:07:32] So that's really where we differentiate ourselves and that's how I think
[00:07:35] New Western has been so successful since 2008 is finding that profile of investor that really
[00:07:42] likes to work with agents and is able to have that one-on-one connection.
[00:07:46] And so our 40 markets are doing great and 2024 is looking really healthy for investment
[00:07:53] marketplaces. So it should be a solid year, but New Western is definitely always looking to grow
[00:08:00] on that side of things. So I think working with agents is one of the things we do best.
[00:08:05] And so that's why this program and this podcast, like everything we're doing is really designed to help bolster
[00:08:10] that relationship. So I love the boots on the ground. I remember when we started to see several
[00:08:17] years ago, some of the iBire companies starting to have problems. Most of those companies didn't
[00:08:24] really have boots on the ground in local markets or maybe they'd hire somebody to do a few things,
[00:08:29] but it seemed like there was a disconnect between what was actually happening in those marketplaces
[00:08:33] and what was happening at the mothership company. And you know, there just seemed to be obviously
[00:08:39] some challenges there. So I imagine that's part of your secret sauce is having people there,
[00:08:45] which obviously is not as profitable because you have compensation for those people, but it keeps
[00:08:50] the company ridiculously healthy. Of course, you're still in business and a lot of those companies
[00:08:55] who did similar things that to Northwestern. I'm in Chicago, so I always want to thank
[00:09:01] New Western, but New Western, you know, is incredible the growth that you guys have had in
[00:09:07] billions in transactions. I mean, it's really, you guys really must understand how to do this in a
[00:09:13] way that is beyond scalable. It's just shocking how much production you do. So tell us a little bit
[00:09:21] about how agents can work with New Western. Yeah, so we have agent relationships, you know,
[00:09:29] pretty much most all the major brokerages throughout our markets. And those are really at the
[00:09:33] agent to agent level. You know, we were a cash buyer for eXp and Keller Williams and some of those
[00:09:40] bigger names, but so many of our transactions are done in that day-to-day local market agent
[00:09:46] relationship. And so a big way agents work with our agents is when they're coming across a house
[00:09:52] that whether it's inherited, distressed, you know, going through trying to look at what you could
[00:10:00] view it as on the market versus an investor versus a cash buyer. The relationship really is just,
[00:10:07] hey, I have this house coming up. It's brutal. It's pretty ugly. What do you think you could do with
[00:10:12] it? And our investor agents are like, yes, let's go. You know, that's that's a great house for us
[00:10:17] because so many of our 200,000 investor investors really look for value add opportunity. So
[00:10:24] they want to add a bathroom. They want to rehab the house. They want to do the floors, the roof.
[00:10:29] And they've gotten so good at putting their processes together to flip these houses or fix and rent
[00:10:36] or buy and hold that. They're really able to do it at a price that makes sense for an investor buying
[00:10:41] cash versus, you know, your everyday MLS buyer like I just bought a house with my wife and it needs a
[00:10:48] ton of work. It'll cost me way more than what our investors are doing because they're so good at it.
[00:10:53] You know, they have the systems in place to help rejuvenate areas and take bad houses and make them
[00:10:58] livable. So my wife and I are just day by day, but they can do it in weeks, you know, so it's very
[00:11:05] interesting. It is. I imagine having to wrangle contractors and all sorts of, you know, service
[00:11:13] workers across the country is probably not the easiest part of that job, but the most one of the
[00:11:20] most important parts. So let's let's talk about how our listeners can interact directly with
[00:11:27] New Western and help their clients. So they come across a distressed property. This is a
[00:11:34] proof example. Our owner, Nick, has some relationship with a city, one of the suburbs here in
[00:11:40] Chicago. And anytime they have like a probate issue or some sort of, I don't, I'm not exactly sure
[00:11:47] how it ends up with the city or the village, but they end up saying, hey, Nick, we got to sell this
[00:11:52] property. It's always in a distressed condition. It's pretty dilapidated and dilapidated rather.
[00:11:58] And then he's, you know, got to clean it up and get it ready to sell. So he comes across a
[00:12:05] property like that. How might he work with you guys? Yeah. So we recently launched what's called
[00:12:11] podium. It's our brokerage and agent referral program, you know, brokerage partnership program.
[00:12:17] However you want to put it, it's really designed to take your retail agent and allow them to submit
[00:12:24] properties that they see that might be distressed or need a lot of work directly to an agent at
[00:12:29] our company. And they'll turn around and give you an offer in 24 hours. And I know there's other
[00:12:34] companies out there that will spit out and offer in four minutes. But our agent will actually come
[00:12:39] out and walk the house with you, tell you why the price is, why it is and build the relationship.
[00:12:44] So every house you see from now on, you can also submit and get a cash offer for.
[00:12:49] And one of the big things within that program is you get a 2% of purchase price referral fee
[00:12:54] at closing. And so we really see it as a way for retail agents to increase revenue in an area where
[00:13:00] they're probably not doing it now. I know there's a lot of agents. They see a house where it's like
[00:13:04] getting that to list is going to be really tough. Right. You know, I'll let someone else with that
[00:13:09] specialty handle it. Well, we just want to buy more houses. We buy a house every 13 minutes.
[00:13:15] We want to be more. And so if you can take a house that you see and you know, it's going to be a
[00:13:22] lot of work. You don't want to become a project manager. And you can just say, I know, you know,
[00:13:27] my agent at New Western can sell that in seven days. You can close in seven to ten days, they're
[00:13:32] 30 to 60, whatever works for your, you know, your seller. But you can go to sell to newwestern.com
[00:13:38] and you can sign up to meet the house or just sign up and get, you know, involved in the program.
[00:13:43] And really that 2% is across the board. So we're, you know, I know there's a lot of changes coming up
[00:13:50] potentially in June and our offer stands. You know, that will be something because of the house
[00:13:56] except that we've been in the way we're able to do houses with our investment marketplace.
[00:14:00] That 2% will still stand whether or not the seller is agreeing to pay it. So that's something that,
[00:14:06] you know, we believe will be really big and the industry has seen houses that need work and knowing,
[00:14:12] okay, well, I've got a little bit of a slow, you know, month. But let me go change by marketing a
[00:14:17] little to find more distressed properties. And then we can, you know, work together and sell as many
[00:14:22] as we can. And so building those individual relationships is really important. And then building
[00:14:28] them out from brokerage down has been something we've been doing as well. So that we can do webinars and
[00:14:33] buy the team lunch and come out and have our GMs and our agents interact on a day-to-day level.
[00:14:39] So we can tell you the zip codes and tell you what to look for. Tell you our buy box, you know,
[00:14:44] 3-2 in this county, but 3-1 in this county, 2-1. So there's little variances across the country that
[00:14:50] really make a big difference to our investors. And our agents are so good at identifying the needs
[00:14:56] that, you know, working with agents and listing agents, retail agents has become such a nice way
[00:15:02] for them to continue growing their numbers. So that's why we wanted to make it a national program.
[00:15:08] And something that wasn't just agent to agent, but now it can be, you know, our 800 agents,
[00:15:13] 2000s because we can buy so many. Yeah, that's really incredible. So it's amazing that you guys
[00:15:21] are purchasing homes that quickly. And back to the example of my boss Nick, the owner who
[00:15:29] who got this listing just the other day and he really didn't want it. And boy, it was in such bad
[00:15:33] condition. And when he puts it on the MLS, it just doesn't look, you know, it's, it really looks bad.
[00:15:38] And we were yelling at him for not using professional photography. We're like, Nick, you got it? He goes,
[00:15:43] have you seen what's in the pictures? He's like, I don't think professional photography is going to help.
[00:15:49] It's a problem, right? So this is something that where you guys can come in and say, hey, we can,
[00:15:54] we got it from here. And the idea that you have already committed with your buyers to be able to
[00:16:01] continue to pay that commission no matter what going forward is a huge thing because obviously
[00:16:07] you're solving a massive, you know, fear point right now for agents who work with buyers going,
[00:16:14] geez, I, you know, I think I'm going to get paid going forward, but we'll see. And obviously,
[00:16:19] you know, future will hold. You guys have already committed to continuing to compensate.
[00:16:24] Agents that way. And I think that is going to be huge for you going forward. So this is a nice way.
[00:16:30] So let's talk about how someone might identify an opportunity. So, you know, if I'm in a market,
[00:16:37] and I say, gosh, I'd love to, you know, earn some additional revenue by referring stuff out to you guys,
[00:16:43] how might I start doing that? What should I be looking for?
[00:16:46] So I'd say when you're going on your traditional, you know,
[00:16:50] listing agreement, your marketing, you're trying to find sellers who want to go to the MLS,
[00:16:55] there are certain agreement, listing agreement meetings you'll go to where you realize,
[00:17:00] okay, well, we do need to change countertops, floors, no one's updated the paint since the 80s.
[00:17:07] Like, there's a lot of things where it's like, all right, well, maybe we could just get them to,
[00:17:12] you know, change all this and then we'll list it. Well, some people need to move, you know, some people
[00:17:16] have to, you know, get out of an unfortunate situation, whether that's their mortgage or whatever.
[00:17:22] We can come in, it doesn't have, like, we buy fire burnouts, we buy, you know,
[00:17:27] quarters, there's, we buy the stress of the distress, but we also buy, you know, very motivated,
[00:17:34] very people that need to move now, because we can still provide a very good market value cash offer,
[00:17:39] depending on the situation. But when you're looking at trying to change some of your marketing
[00:17:46] or looking at going after more, it's, you know, whether you are looking at more foreclosures,
[00:17:51] and because you know that foreclosure has a pending date, you can't list and hope that it doesn't
[00:17:58] sit on the market for 90 days because it doesn't look very good. You can look at doing, or targeting,
[00:18:06] you know, older population, you can look at targeting areas that are up and coming, that typically,
[00:18:17] you know, I'm trying to think of the best way to put it, but really, we like to find areas that
[00:18:23] need value and need value added through someone being able to flip that house. And I don't want to,
[00:18:29] like, there's such, you know, it can be a contation around flipping houses, but we're not a company that's
[00:18:34] just aggregating thousands of houses. We're actually going in and solving what we think to be,
[00:18:39] you know, an inventory crisis, because as you're looking for more inventory and you're rolling down
[00:18:45] the street, you see three, four or five nice houses, and then you see a vacant house,
[00:18:49] overgrown grass, window knocked out, that's a property that's going to take someone very specific
[00:18:55] to buy. And so if you're driving on your normal listening agreements and you come across someone
[00:19:01] that, you know, is in a bad situation or you know someone inherited the house they can't take care of,
[00:19:06] those are all ways we can step in and be that problem solver, that easy button we like to say for
[00:19:13] houses that you don't want to become a project manager, you don't want to have to list, you don't
[00:19:18] want to have to, you know, fight the sell around the fact that their, their floors really don't look
[00:19:23] good anymore, but, you know, because seller expectations are one of the hardest parts about the
[00:19:27] industry. So when we can come in and really explain why our pricing is our pricing instead of
[00:19:33] just spitting out that algorithm, it really helps kind of get the seller understanding why,
[00:19:39] you know, and it helps the listening agent for sure, be able to communicate with the seller,
[00:19:43] like this is why the investors offer or new westerns offer is that because X, Y, and Z.
[00:19:49] So as you're going through and you're looking at how to, you know, generate more revenue from
[00:19:53] those situations, I think it's just a matter of finding houses that you typically would pass on,
[00:19:59] and so when you're looking at your marketing, and you're, you're marketing the high scale, maybe
[00:20:03] you're sending out mailers, maybe you're doing YouTube videos, a lot of that really can exclude
[00:20:08] people in tough situations because they're not your typical clientele, but if you start adding
[00:20:13] mailers to zip codes that typically might not be, you know, your $800,000 house, well, you know,
[00:20:19] three or four hundred thousand dollar houses that are a little rough, four of those in a month that
[00:20:23] you sell to us will get you plenty of, you know, work through it, and so I think fine, well,
[00:20:29] that is to say we buy up to like two or three million dollar homes, it's not a matter of they have to
[00:20:34] be less expensive, you know, but it's just a matter of the right situation. So,
[00:20:39] tweaking your marketing to include those areas you might ignore because you typically don't want to
[00:20:43] list those, well now you don't have to list it, you just have to find it, communicate it, and you know,
[00:20:48] get it closed on. So that's some ways you could tweak it depending on who you're targeting, but
[00:20:54] I wonder too if we're going to start seeing a lot more of homes that you're mentioning would be a good
[00:21:00] fit for you coming into the market as the baby boomers start passing away, you know, for those trying
[00:21:08] to think of a nicer way to say that, but they are, baby boomers are coming to, you know, the later
[00:21:13] stages of their lives, oftentimes these are going to be properties that haven't have been lived in
[00:21:20] without any sort of switch in ownership for 30 plus years. You know, there's going to be a lot of
[00:21:27] these properties coming on the market when you walk in and go, oh my gosh, look at the counter top
[00:21:31] of the floor and you know, it's just it's just going to happen, you know, and as a result, these are
[00:21:36] people who, you know, they're downsizing at this point, they don't want to renovate their home,
[00:21:40] and you're stuck with the situation of gosh, I don't know how we're going to sell this very easily
[00:21:45] because of all the work that's that's needed. So I think almost, you know, and I be curious to
[00:21:50] get your thoughts, I can almost think of building strategic partnerships with like a state planning
[00:21:56] attorneys or people who really deal with probate issues or, you know, wealth transplants,
[00:22:04] I guess financial advisors, I would think that they come across these situations often, you know,
[00:22:10] if somebody inherits a home, you know, mom and dad pass away, you know, at a time when they
[00:22:15] weren't expected to, and all of a sudden now kids are scrambling to do something with this with
[00:22:20] this property. And this is a great opportunity, I think, to say, oh gosh, well, I don't have that
[00:22:26] skill set. I don't really know what to do here. I'm going to just pass it off to a company who has
[00:22:30] this incredible track record. And you know, there it's not the we by ugly houses, you know,
[00:22:38] billboard on the side of the road, which is, you know, essentially you're doing a version of that
[00:22:43] doesn't have to be an ugly home. But this is a new western is a very legitimate sort of,
[00:22:49] you know, white glove sort of investment firm. And they already have all the investors,
[00:22:54] they have the boots on the ground. And that's probably the most important thing is they have local
[00:22:58] representation. So they have people that can go in, make sense of the offer to and explain that
[00:23:04] to the seller and say, here's how we arrived at this number. And, you know, hopefully able to then
[00:23:09] assist them and make maybe the errors or whoever now is responsible for this home. You know,
[00:23:15] job a lot easier. And I know that oftentimes too when when there's, you know, when there's a death
[00:23:22] and this sort of, you know, there's property that is having to be, you know, distributed,
[00:23:27] that can be just incredibly stressful because a lot of times, of course, the children might not
[00:23:32] be living in that area. They're doing these things virtually. You guys not only can, you know,
[00:23:38] can it can handle that home, but you actually have people in those areas in the major markets,
[00:23:42] 40 plus markets, just unbelievable. So, so this agent partner program is really really been great
[00:23:51] for you guys because it allows you to work with any other agent out there. And you're really,
[00:23:58] there aren't too many REALTORS, like you said, who are really focused on distressed properties
[00:24:02] unless they are investors themselves or they work with investors other than that. And that
[00:24:08] typically tends to be its own lane in my experience. It's like agents, there's kind of like three lanes
[00:24:13] I've seen in real estate and I know there's more than that, but the three sort of
[00:24:17] paths I usually see as commercial is kind of its own lane, traditional residential, you know,
[00:24:22] working with individuals. And then of course, you have investor agents or agents that work with
[00:24:29] investors who are investors. And there are three very different lanes and I encourage, you know,
[00:24:34] agents to really probably pick one lane and maybe dabble in the other two, but this is a way to
[00:24:40] think, okay, I'm not a commercial agent or I'm not investor agent. I don't really understand
[00:24:44] investment all that well, but I want to have an option when I come across these opportunities.
[00:24:49] And two, you know, what if there are, if an agent does have an investor, you guys
[00:24:57] always are taking additional investors on as well. I imagine they could refer them to you and say,
[00:25:02] hey, here's a company that's that has an impressive track record and obviously, I have a
[00:25:07] relationship with them and I would really refer you to that. They're buying homes, you know, every,
[00:25:12] you know, whatever, every 13 minutes. So, yeah, that's, that's a really big point as far as like
[00:25:19] choosing your lane and we know that the people that choose that, you know, that kind of residential
[00:25:24] retail real estate agent, they're not going to see this house every day, every week, but it's a matter
[00:25:32] of being able to one, go out and find it or two, have an option when you do see it, you know,
[00:25:37] and it doesn't, the beauty of working with our agents on the ground locally is that you don't have
[00:25:43] to become an expert in real estate investment. You just have to see a house that you want to sell
[00:25:48] that would be really hard to list and we have the expertise to tell you, well, here's some issues
[00:25:55] of why it'd be difficult for an investment or here's the things we could do with our cash
[00:26:00] offer to get it ready. So, it's not having to have all the expertise. It's just being able to
[00:26:05] identify just enough to send it to us and we'll, you know, we'll run the CMA, we'll run you through
[00:26:11] everything you need to know about why this could be a fix and rent, why it would be a fix and flip,
[00:26:15] or, you know, this area, this zip code specifically investors love this type. So, this one maybe
[00:26:22] didn't work, but next time, you know, so there's a little tidbits of information we can give as we
[00:26:27] grow in that relationship with the agent that they don't have to be an expert, they just have to,
[00:26:32] you know, build the relationship and continue to send any house they think, you know, might not be a
[00:26:36] perfect fit for their traditional, you know, way of listing or selling it. So.
[00:26:41] Yeah, it's such an interesting idea. I was thinking of putting on my marketing hat for a moment,
[00:26:46] thinking, how might I find these properties? You know, and you obviously waiting, you could wait
[00:26:51] for them to follow your way, but I'm thinking, you know, you mentioned like mailers or other types
[00:26:57] of campaigns, reach out campaigns that are, I wondered too, I suspect a lot of these homes are
[00:27:03] probably not on the radars of a lot of agents. These are probably an underserved market where
[00:27:11] it's kind of like recruiting REALTORS. If you want to recruit almost all firms want to recruit
[00:27:18] the most productive REALTORS, the ones with highest volume, and then you have people who are
[00:27:23] making a decent living, but not crushing it in real estate, and nobody's reaching out to them.
[00:27:28] And so there's firms now we're seeing that reach out just to those middle tier or even lower tier
[00:27:33] agents saying, hey, we can we can stop us. And I almost think there's this similar sort of thing going
[00:27:37] on here where we could identify some opportunities of those areas. And yes, maybe we as an agent don't
[00:27:46] really want those listings, but why not, you know, see if anyone's interested or having a succession
[00:27:52] situation going on or a transfer, well transfer or death. And I'm curious if you've seen any of the
[00:27:59] agents who refer you business or even the agents that you guys have boots on ground. You know,
[00:28:04] if you had any like sort of marketing ideas for how someone might go out and proactively find
[00:28:11] these properties versus just waiting for them to fall into their lap.
[00:28:15] Yeah, I mean, I think the older population scenario is definitely one we see that is growing
[00:28:21] because there are so many people that would just live such a content happy life in their scenario.
[00:28:26] And they didn't see any problem with what the current market is looking for if you were to list,
[00:28:32] you know, those carpets and the countertops as we were talking about. But those really are
[00:28:36] typically passed down to someone who already either owns a home, lives out of state or so like
[00:28:43] being able to target that, whether through, you know, real estate attorneys or probate things like
[00:28:49] that. Those are a big opportunity for sure because they're forget the stat like how many ever
[00:28:55] millions over 65, you know, every day retiring. Well, a lot of them want to downsize. A lot of them
[00:29:02] want to go live a different life, maybe closer to grandkids that aren't in the area. And at this point,
[00:29:07] a lot of them, there's not much equity they need to, you know, to like they pretty much own
[00:29:12] most of the homes. And so you can really come in with a nice strong catch offer and get them to
[00:29:17] their grandkids so much faster than if you had to go through, you know, updating the countertops
[00:29:23] than finding a tile guy, finding a wood guy, finding the someone to paint the house,
[00:29:27] remove the popcorn ceiling. Our investors love that because they know how to do all that may
[00:29:31] have prudes to do that, you know, in a matter of weeks. And so when you're looking at marketing it
[00:29:37] differently, it's just really including, as you said, like that middle ground, that lower ground,
[00:29:42] like, I mean, just thinking the amount of affordable housing out there that is people are waiting on,
[00:29:48] there's so many houses that are stuck and stagnant right now. It just needs someone's specialty.
[00:29:55] It needs an agent, you know, in the Chicago market to identify it. It needs someone in Tampa knowing
[00:30:01] that, you know, this neighborhood has a lot of people looking to retire soon and thinking we get
[00:30:06] more first-time home buyers and houses that have been taking care of and made livable again
[00:30:12] to transform a, you know, a neighborhood that could potentially be on the downslope and all of
[00:30:16] sudden you have 10 new young families coming in. You have, you know, a Midwestern couple who
[00:30:21] moved to Florida. You have areas that are really starting to be vibrant again because the houses
[00:30:26] are now turned over from either investors or agents finding a way to make someone else's
[00:30:32] situation, whether unfortunate or fortunate, into a cash offer, into a new home. And now you have
[00:30:39] like this community that where all this value is added. Now their homes are more, you know,
[00:30:44] priced appropriately and, you know, we're not price-gowning work. We're taking it and we do such
[00:30:50] volume that we're really just trying to get as many houses as we can to the hands of our investors.
[00:30:56] So our houses come in at, you know, market value and we continue to like push through that to make
[00:31:02] sure they're, they really are adding to the community and that's our investor base is very big on that.
[00:31:07] Yeah, I think that's really important that you're actually, you know, improving these areas
[00:31:14] and these homes. How often are you turn around and selling versus, you know, buy and hold where
[00:31:22] you'll be renting out? Do you guys only sell or do you sometimes hold on and manage? Or
[00:31:28] So we don't manage any of them ourselves. I'd say out of our 200,000 investors, it's probably
[00:31:34] probably close to 50, 50 or 40, 60 depending. And it really just depends on what their preference is.
[00:31:41] You know, we have some investors who have, this is their first purchase, their first investment,
[00:31:46] and they're very excited to get a renter, to rehab a house, you know, in an up-and-coming neighborhood.
[00:31:52] And then we have some that have 10 doors, 15 doors, you know, but we don't. Everyone that's an
[00:31:57] investor with us has to, one, be qualified and two, go through a disclosure process to where we're
[00:32:05] not just selling to big corporations. We're actually selling to the end investor that ends
[00:32:11] buyer, that individual really looking to do something with that home. And so as you go through
[00:32:18] and you look at it, you know, it's a matter of, are you qualified? Do you have enough cash to do it?
[00:32:25] We work with different loans, like we own Sherman Bridge as well. And so they have a multitude of
[00:32:32] companies that work with certain loan types depending on your situation, whether cash or
[00:32:37] whatever. And so that's very helpful to investors who don't have all cash.
[00:32:43] But yeah, I think it's, you know, sometimes just a matter of finding the right opportunity within
[00:32:49] that. But yeah, I was thinking like if it was me and I was looking for some of these opportunities
[00:32:54] to pass over to New Western, I would possibly think about maybe purchasing even some demographic data
[00:33:02] and specifically age, age information about neighborhoods, communities, you know, suburb cities,
[00:33:08] and really getting a sense of where those, where those opportunities are. And then, you know,
[00:33:14] creating a marketing campaign targeting specifically those, those types of properties or those
[00:33:19] community, those parts of the community. So I think there's a lot of opportunity here that,
[00:33:24] again, is, is likely again, it's not a traditional retail agent's pop maybe first choice in
[00:33:32] the homes they want to deal with or list, but they now have a solution. And again, this idea of,
[00:33:39] you know, working a little bit outside of the current retail residential real estate world, which is,
[00:33:45] you know, low inventory high interest rates and everyone struggling in that particular lane.
[00:33:51] And then if you can sort of add in a little stream of, and again, you're really not doing much.
[00:33:57] You're just a really making a connection. You're essentially connecting, connecting an opportunity
[00:34:03] to New Western and receiving a very healthy commission as a result, a very generous, I think,
[00:34:10] commission. So I think that's a perfect place for us to just kind of wrap up and say, hey,
[00:34:16] if you want to learn more about new Western, sell to newwestern.com is where you can go, that's
[00:34:22] the agent, sort of site, and you can learn about this. And really what you're doing is you just
[00:34:27] want to think new Western anytime you come across a property where you're like, oh my gosh,
[00:34:32] this is going to be a, this is going to be a headache anytime you have that situation. And,
[00:34:36] again, thinking about maybe I could go proactively find those, you know, maybe talk to some lenders,
[00:34:42] talk to some banks who maybe have some of these properties on their books, you know, talk to
[00:34:47] estate planning attorneys, financial advisors, accountants, real estate attorneys, as you mentioned.
[00:34:53] These are all great possibilities of how to find these properties or, you know, consider
[00:34:59] blanketing a certain neighborhood. Maybe, you know, maybe even do a door knocking campaign.
[00:35:04] As much as I think a lot of people sort of shudder at that idea, I'm thinking that a lot of these
[00:35:09] properties, if the owners are still living, that, you know, these are people that probably aren't
[00:35:15] super tech savvy. And maybe, you know, aren't going to be as receptive to social media marketing or
[00:35:20] YouTube marketing, for example, maybe, you know, a good old knock on the door or may just in fact say,
[00:35:26] you know, hey, I was just in the neighborhood curious if you're thinking about moving or downsizing
[00:35:30] anytime soon, you know, and that, great, because I got a, I got a, you know, company I want you to
[00:35:35] talk to. It's not a bad idea. I like it. Yeah, it's not at all. It's a good point. I was going to say,
[00:35:41] just look at one last thing looking at, you know, expanding your opportunity is, if you're already
[00:35:46] going on, you know, how many ever lunches a month trying to get listings and you're looking at
[00:35:52] how many calls and contacts you have in your phone, which one of those contacts probably knows
[00:35:57] another five, another 10 people. And if you can become a resource for your contacts contacts of
[00:36:03] you have a distressed property or your, you know, your best friend's sister's cousin just inherited a
[00:36:07] property. I mean, you are now a resource for more than just market ready homes where people want
[00:36:14] to list. You're now a resource to all your contacts resources to become a distressed property
[00:36:20] investment type agent expert because you can use us as your arm to do different things with
[00:36:26] in your market and your network and you're already growing your network. So just drop a line at
[00:36:31] the end of a call. Hey, well, maybe not your home, but you have someone who needs this type of home.
[00:36:36] I mean, that it really is such an easy tweak that you could really generate next to 10 houses a year.
[00:36:41] Absolutely. I was thinking you could, you could even say, hey, I have added in recently a new service
[00:36:48] for my clients where I have learned how to start servicing homes that are distressed. And you
[00:36:54] could even just have that quick conversation. You know, someone, somebody maybe parents pass away.
[00:36:59] There's kids here at her at a home. They don't really want. They want to sell. But maybe the home
[00:37:03] hasn't been updated in 20 or 30 years and or longer. And, and maybe, you know, look, there's just
[00:37:10] issues with it. I now have a solution. So if that ever, you know, if you ever hear about this
[00:37:15] fear, you know, anyone in my sphere of influence to anyone, you know, please, please let me know. And
[00:37:20] I can connect them with my partners. I think you're absolutely right. I think, you know, a lot of times
[00:37:25] people don't know about where they should go to handle something like that. And unless you tell
[00:37:32] them in advance, otherwise they're going to Google or they're thinking, well, I guess I don't know
[00:37:36] anyone in that area. I don't live there. I don't know the REALTOR is in that area. This is an
[00:37:40] opportunity to, you know, really cast a super wide debt by your right telling everybody, you know,
[00:37:46] I now can service these, these potential properties. And again, all you're doing is really making
[00:37:51] a connection and letting you Western take the ball and run with it from there. And their track record
[00:37:56] is really impressive, just incredible. And so I want really encourage everyone go to selltonnewwestern.com,
[00:38:04] learn about their, their agent partner program. They want to work with you and they want to help you
[00:38:09] with the properties that quite frankly, you don't want to deal with. So it also find them on Instagram
[00:38:14] and Facebook just search for new Western. It's there. We'll have a link to them in the show notes.
[00:38:19] Guys, this is a very cool thing. And again, just just to sort of let you know why we chose new
[00:38:23] Western to be on the show is they came to us and said, we have a solution for your listeners.
[00:38:28] And you know, it's funny because we get, we do get a lot of pitches to, for guests to be on our show
[00:38:34] that are investors who, you know, who just want access to our audience. But they never really have
[00:38:39] a solution in place or a reason for us to have them on other than for them to just promote themselves.
[00:38:45] And this is really an opportunity that we thought was really helpful to our listeners because
[00:38:49] we do get a lot of questions going, hey, could you do more investor-related content on our show?
[00:38:55] And we say, well, there's so many other podcasts and already do that. But, you know, and feel
[00:38:59] free to listen to any of those shows if you'd like. But our audience, they want to, you know,
[00:39:04] they're focused in their lane, which is traditional, which is residential retail, mom and pop,
[00:39:10] or not mom and pop, sorry, you know, husband and wife or whoever, build, building, you know,
[00:39:15] families, basically, or individuals, you know, doing their own home purchases or sales. They
[00:39:20] don't really understand this world. They don't want to deal with this world. But at the same time,
[00:39:24] be nice to earn a referral commission on something so simple and easy and let new Western do all the
[00:39:30] heavy lifting because it's a lot of heavy lifting. And they know how to do it at scale. And you don't
[00:39:35] want to cut your teeth on one of these properties if you've never done it before. It is quite frankly,
[00:39:40] it's a nightmare to deal with if you don't have a ton of experience. And anyone who's ever had to do it,
[00:39:46] just ask another REALTOR, who's ever had to do it, they will tell you that this is a big,
[00:39:52] big undertaking for maybe a smaller commission, you know, for all of the work that goes in. Whereas,
[00:39:57] in this case, you you offload all the work and to New Western and they're thrilled to do this.
[00:40:03] This is what they do. So guys, please consider working with New Western, New West, sell to
[00:40:08] newwestern.com is the website. We will have links to all of their social as well as other things
[00:40:14] placed where you can learn more about them and how to provide referrals. Kurt, thank you on behalf
[00:40:19] of our audience for providing a solution and more importantly, a way for them to generate additional
[00:40:24] revenues this year. We know this is a tough year for retail residential agents. I mean, we have 800
[00:40:30] agents at our firm. You know, it's tough. It's a tough year. And you know, anything that you can do
[00:40:35] to add in some additional revenue is going to help this year. So let's let's build these relationships
[00:40:40] and figure out a way to find some of these opportunities or at least let every one of your clients
[00:40:45] know how they can, if they find do these opportunities, how to pass those over to you because you're
[00:40:50] really doing, you know, somebody a big favor by taking this workload off of their hand. Kurt,
[00:40:56] thank you on behalf of our audience. Also, on behalf of Kurt and myself, thanks to the audience for
[00:41:01] for listening and paying and being present for this episode. We encourage you to please consider
[00:41:06] telling a friend, look, there's a lot of REALTORS out there who don't listen to our show. They're not
[00:41:10] aware of it. Please let them know. Send them a link to this episode so that they know what to do when
[00:41:15] they come across these types of properties. We'd really very much appreciate it. And also,
[00:41:19] so tell a friend and also leave us a review. Let us know what you think of the show. We really

By the way, I've been in healthcare, product development and beer sales as well. You know, university research labs and golf technology, those two I've not done. Relationship building transcends industries so moving into something he already loved like real estate was the perfect transition. Please learn more about Kurt's company Kurt works with. New Western at sell to newwestern.com. Again, sell to newwestern.com will have a link to that in the show. It's also follow new Western on Instagram, Facebook, anywhere. We're going to have all of the links in the show notes but you could just search for new Western in Instagram, Facebook, find them and they've got really great content in social. Kurt, welcome to the show. Thank you. Yeah, I'm happy to be here. I'm excited. I'm excited too. We so rarely have investor companies or investor agents on just because there's so many podcasts already that service those consumers but our listeners are rather our agents who want to learn about investments and what to do when they come across a client and maybe the agent themselves doesn't have a lot of skill in that area or doesn't really know how to handle those clients sort of understanding their needs as well as what to do. So I love that you guys have a solution for that. But before we dive into that, let's talk about you and your background. So you've done a lot of different things as I was mentioning in the past. What brought you into the new Western? Yeah, so I was living in Tampa with my wife and three kids and one of my best friends here, Seth Mitchell. He has been here since college and I've never heard anything but good things about new Western. And so he sent me the role for Partnership Manager and he thought it would be a really good fit with the company and my career growth. And so I applied and just never looked back and it's been, it really has been the perfect fit. I've been able to use a lot of what I've learned in the past about relationships and scaling partners and looking at the ways to market certain things to different people. And it just kind of was it all fell into place and it's been really good ever since. I'm very thankful that I got here. Great. Well, tell us what New Western is. Yeah, so New Western is a real estate investment marketplace. We have over 200,000 investors actively buying and selling from us in our 40 plus markets. We have been around since 2008 and we've done over 17 billion in transactions. So we are always buying, we're always selling, we're always looking for new people to work with. And in each of our markets, we have that individual brokerage office. So we're very much a boots on the ground investment company versus some that tend to lean towards algorithms. We really have local agents ready to give you a cash offer, but that cash offer will come with an in-person meeting talking through investment strategy is what types of houses to look for. So that's really where we differentiate ourselves and that's how I think New Western has been so successful since 2008 is finding that profile of investor that really likes to work with agents and is able to have that one-on-one connection. And so our 40 markets are doing great and 2024 is looking really healthy for investment marketplaces. So it should be a solid year, but New Western is definitely always looking to grow on that side of things. So I think working with agents is one of the things we do best. And so that's why this program and this podcast, like everything we're doing is really designed to help bolster that relationship. So I love the boots on the ground. I remember when we started to see several years ago, some of the iBire companies starting to have problems. Most of those companies didn't really have boots on the ground in local markets or maybe they'd hire somebody to do a few things, but it seemed like there was a disconnect between what was actually happening in those marketplaces and what was happening at the mothership company. And you know, there just seemed to be obviously some challenges there. So I imagine that's part of your secret sauce is having people there, which obviously is not as profitable because you have compensation for those people, but it keeps the company ridiculously healthy. Of course, you're still in business and a lot of those companies who did similar things that to Northwestern. I'm in Chicago, so I always want to thank New Western, but New Western, you know, is incredible the growth that you guys have had in billions in transactions. I mean, it's really, you guys really must understand how to do this in a way that is beyond scalable. It's just shocking how much production you do. So tell us a little bit about how agents can work with New Western. Yeah, so we have agent relationships, you know, pretty much most all the major brokerages throughout our markets. And those are really at the agent to agent level. You know, we were a cash buyer for eXp and Keller Williams and some of those bigger names, but so many of our transactions are done in that day-to-day local market agent relationship. And so a big way agents work with our agents is when they're coming across a house that whether it's inherited, distressed, you know, going through trying to look at what you could view it as on the market versus an investor versus a cash buyer. The relationship really is just, hey, I have this house coming up. It's brutal. It's pretty ugly. What do you think you could do with it? And our investor agents are like, yes, let's go. You know, that's that's a great house for us because so many of our 200,000 investor investors really look for value add opportunity. So they want to add a bathroom. They want to rehab the house. They want to do the floors, the roof. And they've gotten so good at putting their processes together to flip these houses or fix and rent or buy and hold that. They're really able to do it at a price that makes sense for an investor buying cash versus, you know, your everyday MLS buyer like I just bought a house with my wife and it needs a ton of work. It'll cost me way more than what our investors are doing because they're so good at it. You know, they have the systems in place to help rejuvenate areas and take bad houses and make them livable. So my wife and I are just day by day, but they can do it in weeks, you know, so it's very interesting. It is. I imagine having to wrangle contractors and all sorts of, you know, service workers across the country is probably not the easiest part of that job, but the most one of the most important parts. So let's let's talk about how our listeners can interact directly with New Western and help their clients. So they come across a distressed property. This is a proof example. Our owner, Nick, has some relationship with a city, one of the suburbs here in Chicago. And anytime they have like a probate issue or some sort of, I don't, I'm not exactly sure how it ends up with the city or the village, but they end up saying, hey, Nick, we got to sell this property. It's always in a distressed condition. It's pretty dilapidated and dilapidated rather. And then he's, you know, got to clean it up and get it ready to sell. So he comes across a property like that. How might he work with you guys? Yeah. So we recently launched what's called podium. It's our brokerage and agent referral program, you know, brokerage partnership program. However you want to put it, it's really designed to take your retail agent and allow them to submit properties that they see that might be distressed or need a lot of work directly to an agent at our company. And they'll turn around and give you an offer in 24 hours. And I know there's other companies out there that will spit out and offer in four minutes. But our agent will actually come out and walk the house with you, tell you why the price is, why it is and build the relationship. So every house you see from now on, you can also submit and get a cash offer for. And one of the big things within that program is you get a 2% of purchase price referral fee at closing. And so we really see it as a way for retail agents to increase revenue in an area where they're probably not doing it now. I know there's a lot of agents. They see a house where it's like getting that to list is going to be really tough. Right. You know, I'll let someone else with that specialty handle it. Well, we just want to buy more houses. We buy a house every 13 minutes. We want to be more. And so if you can take a house that you see and you know, it's going to be a lot of work. You don't want to become a project manager. And you can just say, I know, you know, my agent at New Western can sell that in seven days. You can close in seven to ten days, they're 30 to 60, whatever works for your, you know, your seller. But you can go to sell to newwestern.com and you can sign up to meet the house or just sign up and get, you know, involved in the program. And really that 2% is across the board. So we're, you know, I know there's a lot of changes coming up potentially in June and our offer stands. You know, that will be something because of the house except that we've been in the way we're able to do houses with our investment marketplace. That 2% will still stand whether or not the seller is agreeing to pay it. So that's something that, you know, we believe will be really big and the industry has seen houses that need work and knowing, okay, well, I've got a little bit of a slow, you know, month. But let me go change by marketing a little to find more distressed properties. And then we can, you know, work together and sell as many as we can. And so building those individual relationships is really important. And then building them out from brokerage down has been something we've been doing as well. So that we can do webinars and buy the team lunch and come out and have our GMs and our agents interact on a day-to-day level. So we can tell you the zip codes and tell you what to look for. Tell you our buy box, you know, 3-2 in this county, but 3-1 in this county, 2-1. So there's little variances across the country that really make a big difference to our investors. And our agents are so good at identifying the needs that, you know, working with agents and listing agents, retail agents has become such a nice way for them to continue growing their numbers. So that's why we wanted to make it a national program. And something that wasn't just agent to agent, but now it can be, you know, our 800 agents, 2000s because we can buy so many. Yeah, that's really incredible. So it's amazing that you guys are purchasing homes that quickly. And back to the example of my boss Nick, the owner who who got this listing just the other day and he really didn't want it. And boy, it was in such bad condition. And when he puts it on the MLS, it just doesn't look, you know, it's, it really looks bad. And we were yelling at him for not using professional photography. We're like, Nick, you got it? He goes, have you seen what's in the pictures? He's like, I don't think professional photography is going to help. It's a problem, right? So this is something that where you guys can come in and say, hey, we can, we got it from here. And the idea that you have already committed with your buyers to be able to continue to pay that commission no matter what going forward is a huge thing because obviously you're solving a massive, you know, fear point right now for agents who work with buyers going, geez, I, you know, I think I'm going to get paid going forward, but we'll see. And obviously, you know, future will hold. You guys have already committed to continuing to compensate. Agents that way. And I think that is going to be huge for you going forward. So this is a nice way. So let's talk about how someone might identify an opportunity. So, you know, if I'm in a market, and I say, gosh, I'd love to, you know, earn some additional revenue by referring stuff out to you guys, how might I start doing that? What should I be looking for? So I'd say when you're going on your traditional, you know, listing agreement, your marketing, you're trying to find sellers who want to go to the MLS, there are certain agreement, listing agreement meetings you'll go to where you realize, okay, well, we do need to change countertops, floors, no one's updated the paint since the 80s. Like, there's a lot of things where it's like, all right, well, maybe we could just get them to, you know, change all this and then we'll list it. Well, some people need to move, you know, some people have to, you know, get out of an unfortunate situation, whether that's their mortgage or whatever. We can come in, it doesn't have, like, we buy fire burnouts, we buy, you know, quarters, there's, we buy the stress of the distress, but we also buy, you know, very motivated, very people that need to move now, because we can still provide a very good market value cash offer, depending on the situation. But when you're looking at trying to change some of your marketing or looking at going after more, it's, you know, whether you are looking at more foreclosures, and because you know that foreclosure has a pending date, you can't list and hope that it doesn't sit on the market for 90 days because it doesn't look very good. You can look at doing, or targeting, you know, older population, you can look at targeting areas that are up and coming, that typically, you know, I'm trying to think of the best way to put it, but really, we like to find areas that need value and need value added through someone being able to flip that house. And I don't want to, like, there's such, you know, it can be a contation around flipping houses, but we're not a company that's just aggregating thousands of houses. We're actually going in and solving what we think to be, you know, an inventory crisis, because as you're looking for more inventory and you're rolling down the street, you see three, four or five nice houses, and then you see a vacant house, overgrown grass, window knocked out, that's a property that's going to take someone very specific to buy. And so if you're driving on your normal listening agreements and you come across someone that, you know, is in a bad situation or you know someone inherited the house they can't take care of, those are all ways we can step in and be that problem solver, that easy button we like to say for houses that you don't want to become a project manager, you don't want to have to list, you don't want to have to, you know, fight the sell around the fact that their, their floors really don't look good anymore, but, you know, because seller expectations are one of the hardest parts about the industry. So when we can come in and really explain why our pricing is our pricing instead of just spitting out that algorithm, it really helps kind of get the seller understanding why, you know, and it helps the listening agent for sure, be able to communicate with the seller, like this is why the investors offer or new westerns offer is that because X, Y, and Z. So as you're going through and you're looking at how to, you know, generate more revenue from those situations, I think it's just a matter of finding houses that you typically would pass on, and so when you're looking at your marketing, and you're, you're marketing the high scale, maybe you're sending out mailers, maybe you're doing YouTube videos, a lot of that really can exclude people in tough situations because they're not your typical clientele, but if you start adding mailers to zip codes that typically might not be, you know, your $800,000 house, well, you know, three or four hundred thousand dollar houses that are a little rough, four of those in a month that you sell to us will get you plenty of, you know, work through it, and so I think fine, well, that is to say we buy up to like two or three million dollar homes, it's not a matter of they have to be less expensive, you know, but it's just a matter of the right situation. So, tweaking your marketing to include those areas you might ignore because you typically don't want to list those, well now you don't have to list it, you just have to find it, communicate it, and you know, get it closed on. So that's some ways you could tweak it depending on who you're targeting, but I wonder too if we're going to start seeing a lot more of homes that you're mentioning would be a good fit for you coming into the market as the baby boomers start passing away, you know, for those trying to think of a nicer way to say that, but they are, baby boomers are coming to, you know, the later stages of their lives, oftentimes these are going to be properties that haven't have been lived in without any sort of switch in ownership for 30 plus years. You know, there's going to be a lot of these properties coming on the market when you walk in and go, oh my gosh, look at the counter top of the floor and you know, it's just it's just going to happen, you know, and as a result, these are people who, you know, they're downsizing at this point, they don't want to renovate their home, and you're stuck with the situation of gosh, I don't know how we're going to sell this very easily because of all the work that's that's needed. So I think almost, you know, and I be curious to get your thoughts, I can almost think of building strategic partnerships with like a state planning attorneys or people who really deal with probate issues or, you know, wealth transplants, I guess financial advisors, I would think that they come across these situations often, you know, if somebody inherits a home, you know, mom and dad pass away, you know, at a time when they weren't expected to, and all of a sudden now kids are scrambling to do something with this with this property. And this is a great opportunity, I think, to say, oh gosh, well, I don't have that skill set. I don't really know what to do here. I'm going to just pass it off to a company who has this incredible track record. And you know, there it's not the we by ugly houses, you know, billboard on the side of the road, which is, you know, essentially you're doing a version of that doesn't have to be an ugly home. But this is a new western is a very legitimate sort of, you know, white glove sort of investment firm. And they already have all the investors, they have the boots on the ground. And that's probably the most important thing is they have local representation. So they have people that can go in, make sense of the offer to and explain that to the seller and say, here's how we arrived at this number. And, you know, hopefully able to then assist them and make maybe the errors or whoever now is responsible for this home. You know, job a lot easier. And I know that oftentimes too when when there's, you know, when there's a death and this sort of, you know, there's property that is having to be, you know, distributed, that can be just incredibly stressful because a lot of times, of course, the children might not be living in that area. They're doing these things virtually. You guys not only can, you know, can it can handle that home, but you actually have people in those areas in the major markets, 40 plus markets, just unbelievable. So, so this agent partner program is really really been great for you guys because it allows you to work with any other agent out there. And you're really, there aren't too many REALTORS, like you said, who are really focused on distressed properties unless they are investors themselves or they work with investors other than that. And that typically tends to be its own lane in my experience. It's like agents, there's kind of like three lanes I've seen in real estate and I know there's more than that, but the three sort of paths I usually see as commercial is kind of its own lane, traditional residential, you know, working with individuals. And then of course, you have investor agents or agents that work with investors who are investors. And there are three very different lanes and I encourage, you know, agents to really probably pick one lane and maybe dabble in the other two, but this is a way to think, okay, I'm not a commercial agent or I'm not investor agent. I don't really understand investment all that well, but I want to have an option when I come across these opportunities. And two, you know, what if there are, if an agent does have an investor, you guys always are taking additional investors on as well. I imagine they could refer them to you and say, hey, here's a company that's that has an impressive track record and obviously, I have a relationship with them and I would really refer you to that. They're buying homes, you know, every, you know, whatever, every 13 minutes. So, yeah, that's, that's a really big point as far as like choosing your lane and we know that the people that choose that, you know, that kind of residential retail real estate agent, they're not going to see this house every day, every week, but it's a matter of being able to one, go out and find it or two, have an option when you do see it, you know, and it doesn't, the beauty of working with our agents on the ground locally is that you don't have to become an expert in real estate investment. You just have to see a house that you want to sell that would be really hard to list and we have the expertise to tell you, well, here's some issues of why it'd be difficult for an investment or here's the things we could do with our cash offer to get it ready. So, it's not having to have all the expertise. It's just being able to identify just enough to send it to us and we'll, you know, we'll run the CMA, we'll run you through everything you need to know about why this could be a fix and rent, why it would be a fix and flip, or, you know, this area, this zip code specifically investors love this type. So, this one maybe didn't work, but next time, you know, so there's a little tidbits of information we can give as we grow in that relationship with the agent that they don't have to be an expert, they just have to, you know, build the relationship and continue to send any house they think, you know, might not be a perfect fit for their traditional, you know, way of listing or selling it. So. Yeah, it's such an interesting idea. I was thinking of putting on my marketing hat for a moment, thinking, how might I find these properties? You know, and you obviously waiting, you could wait for them to follow your way, but I'm thinking, you know, you mentioned like mailers or other types of campaigns, reach out campaigns that are, I wondered too, I suspect a lot of these homes are probably not on the radars of a lot of agents. These are probably an underserved market where it's kind of like recruiting REALTORS. If you want to recruit almost all firms want to recruit the most productive REALTORS, the ones with highest volume, and then you have people who are making a decent living, but not crushing it in real estate, and nobody's reaching out to them. And so there's firms now we're seeing that reach out just to those middle tier or even lower tier agents saying, hey, we can we can stop us. And I almost think there's this similar sort of thing going on here where we could identify some opportunities of those areas. And yes, maybe we as an agent don't really want those listings, but why not, you know, see if anyone's interested or having a succession situation going on or a transfer, well transfer or death. And I'm curious if you've seen any of the agents who refer you business or even the agents that you guys have boots on ground. You know, if you had any like sort of marketing ideas for how someone might go out and proactively find these properties versus just waiting for them to fall into their lap. Yeah, I mean, I think the older population scenario is definitely one we see that is growing because there are so many people that would just live such a content happy life in their scenario. And they didn't see any problem with what the current market is looking for if you were to list, you know, those carpets and the countertops as we were talking about. But those really are typically passed down to someone who already either owns a home, lives out of state or so like being able to target that, whether through, you know, real estate attorneys or probate things like that. Those are a big opportunity for sure because they're forget the stat like how many ever millions over 65, you know, every day retiring. Well, a lot of them want to downsize. A lot of them want to go live a different life, maybe closer to grandkids that aren't in the area. And at this point, a lot of them, there's not much equity they need to, you know, to like they pretty much own most of the homes. And so you can really come in with a nice strong catch offer and get them to their grandkids so much faster than if you had to go through, you know, updating the countertops than finding a tile guy, finding a wood guy, finding the someone to paint the house, remove the popcorn ceiling. Our investors love that because they know how to do all that may have prudes to do that, you know, in a matter of weeks. And so when you're looking at marketing it differently, it's just really including, as you said, like that middle ground, that lower ground, like, I mean, just thinking the amount of affordable housing out there that is people are waiting on, there's so many houses that are stuck and stagnant right now. It just needs someone's specialty. It needs an agent, you know, in the Chicago market to identify it. It needs someone in Tampa knowing that, you know, this neighborhood has a lot of people looking to retire soon and thinking we get more first-time home buyers and houses that have been taking care of and made livable again to transform a, you know, a neighborhood that could potentially be on the downslope and all of sudden you have 10 new young families coming in. You have, you know, a Midwestern couple who moved to Florida. You have areas that are really starting to be vibrant again because the houses are now turned over from either investors or agents finding a way to make someone else's situation, whether unfortunate or fortunate, into a cash offer, into a new home. And now you have like this community that where all this value is added. Now their homes are more, you know, priced appropriately and, you know, we're not price-gowning work. We're taking it and we do such volume that we're really just trying to get as many houses as we can to the hands of our investors. So our houses come in at, you know, market value and we continue to like push through that to make sure they're, they really are adding to the community and that's our investor base is very big on that. Yeah, I think that's really important that you're actually, you know, improving these areas and these homes. How often are you turn around and selling versus, you know, buy and hold where you'll be renting out? Do you guys only sell or do you sometimes hold on and manage? Or So we don't manage any of them ourselves. I'd say out of our 200,000 investors, it's probably probably close to 50, 50 or 40, 60 depending. And it really just depends on what their preference is. You know, we have some investors who have, this is their first purchase, their first investment, and they're very excited to get a renter, to rehab a house, you know, in an up-and-coming neighborhood. And then we have some that have 10 doors, 15 doors, you know, but we don't. Everyone that's an investor with us has to, one, be qualified and two, go through a disclosure process to where we're not just selling to big corporations. We're actually selling to the end investor that ends buyer, that individual really looking to do something with that home. And so as you go through and you look at it, you know, it's a matter of, are you qualified? Do you have enough cash to do it? We work with different loans, like we own Sherman Bridge as well. And so they have a multitude of companies that work with certain loan types depending on your situation, whether cash or whatever. And so that's very helpful to investors who don't have all cash. But yeah, I think it's, you know, sometimes just a matter of finding the right opportunity within that. But yeah, I was thinking like if it was me and I was looking for some of these opportunities to pass over to New Western, I would possibly think about maybe purchasing even some demographic data and specifically age, age information about neighborhoods, communities, you know, suburb cities, and really getting a sense of where those, where those opportunities are. And then, you know, creating a marketing campaign targeting specifically those, those types of properties or those community, those parts of the community. So I think there's a lot of opportunity here that, again, is, is likely again, it's not a traditional retail agent's pop maybe first choice in the homes they want to deal with or list, but they now have a solution. And again, this idea of, you know, working a little bit outside of the current retail residential real estate world, which is, you know, low inventory high interest rates and everyone struggling in that particular lane. And then if you can sort of add in a little stream of, and again, you're really not doing much. You're just a really making a connection. You're essentially connecting, connecting an opportunity to New Western and receiving a very healthy commission as a result, a very generous, I think, commission. So I think that's a perfect place for us to just kind of wrap up and say, hey, if you want to learn more about new Western, sell to newwestern.com is where you can go, that's the agent, sort of site, and you can learn about this. And really what you're doing is you just want to think new Western anytime you come across a property where you're like, oh my gosh, this is going to be a, this is going to be a headache anytime you have that situation. And, again, thinking about maybe I could go proactively find those, you know, maybe talk to some lenders, talk to some banks who maybe have some of these properties on their books, you know, talk to estate planning attorneys, financial advisors, accountants, real estate attorneys, as you mentioned. These are all great possibilities of how to find these properties or, you know, consider blanketing a certain neighborhood. Maybe, you know, maybe even do a door knocking campaign. As much as I think a lot of people sort of shudder at that idea, I'm thinking that a lot of these properties, if the owners are still living, that, you know, these are people that probably aren't super tech savvy. And maybe, you know, aren't going to be as receptive to social media marketing or YouTube marketing, for example, maybe, you know, a good old knock on the door or may just in fact say, you know, hey, I was just in the neighborhood curious if you're thinking about moving or downsizing anytime soon, you know, and that, great, because I got a, I got a, you know, company I want you to talk to. It's not a bad idea. I like it. Yeah, it's not at all. It's a good point. I was going to say, just look at one last thing looking at, you know, expanding your opportunity is, if you're already going on, you know, how many ever lunches a month trying to get listings and you're looking at how many calls and contacts you have in your phone, which one of those contacts probably knows another five, another 10 people. And if you can become a resource for your contacts contacts of you have a distressed property or your, you know, your best friend's sister's cousin just inherited a property. I mean, you are now a resource for more than just market ready homes where people want to list. You're now a resource to all your contacts resources to become a distressed property investment type agent expert because you can use us as your arm to do different things with in your market and your network and you're already growing your network. So just drop a line at the end of a call. Hey, well, maybe not your home, but you have someone who needs this type of home. I mean, that it really is such an easy tweak that you could really generate next to 10 houses a year. Absolutely. I was thinking you could, you could even say, hey, I have added in recently a new service for my clients where I have learned how to start servicing homes that are distressed. And you could even just have that quick conversation. You know, someone, somebody maybe parents pass away. There's kids here at her at a home. They don't really want. They want to sell. But maybe the home hasn't been updated in 20 or 30 years and or longer. And, and maybe, you know, look, there's just issues with it. I now have a solution. So if that ever, you know, if you ever hear about this fear, you know, anyone in my sphere of influence to anyone, you know, please, please let me know. And I can connect them with my partners. I think you're absolutely right. I think, you know, a lot of times people don't know about where they should go to handle something like that. And unless you tell them in advance, otherwise they're going to Google or they're thinking, well, I guess I don't know anyone in that area. I don't live there. I don't know the REALTOR is in that area. This is an opportunity to, you know, really cast a super wide debt by your right telling everybody, you know, I now can service these, these potential properties. And again, all you're doing is really making a connection and letting you Western take the ball and run with it from there. And their track record is really impressive, just incredible. And so I want really encourage everyone go to selltonnewwestern.com, learn about their, their agent partner program. They want to work with you and they want to help you with the properties that quite frankly, you don't want to deal with. So it also find them on Instagram and Facebook just search for new Western. It's there. We'll have a link to them in the show notes. Guys, this is a very cool thing. And again, just just to sort of let you know why we chose new Western to be on the show is they came to us and said, we have a solution for your listeners. And you know, it's funny because we get, we do get a lot of pitches to, for guests to be on our show that are investors who, you know, who just want access to our audience. But they never really have a solution in place or a reason for us to have them on other than for them to just promote themselves. And this is really an opportunity that we thought was really helpful to our listeners because we do get a lot of questions going, hey, could you do more investor-related content on our show? And we say, well, there's so many other podcasts and already do that. But, you know, and feel free to listen to any of those shows if you'd like. But our audience, they want to, you know, they're focused in their lane, which is traditional, which is residential retail, mom and pop, or not mom and pop, sorry, you know, husband and wife or whoever, build, building, you know, families, basically, or individuals, you know, doing their own home purchases or sales. They don't really understand this world. They don't want to deal with this world. But at the same time, be nice to earn a referral commission on something so simple and easy and let new Western do all the heavy lifting because it's a lot of heavy lifting. And they know how to do it at scale. And you don't want to cut your teeth on one of these properties if you've never done it before. It is quite frankly, it's a nightmare to deal with if you don't have a ton of experience. And anyone who's ever had to do it, just ask another REALTOR, who's ever had to do it, they will tell you that this is a big, big undertaking for maybe a smaller commission, you know, for all of the work that goes in. Whereas, in this case, you you offload all the work and to New Western and they're thrilled to do this. This is what they do. So guys, please consider working with New Western, New West, sell to newwestern.com is the website. We will have links to all of their social as well as other things placed where you can learn more about them and how to provide referrals.
