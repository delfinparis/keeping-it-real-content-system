[00:02:34] Carrie, welcome once again.
[00:02:36] Hi there.
[00:02:37] How are you?
[00:02:38] I'm good.
[00:02:39] I'm good.
[00:02:40] Good.
[00:02:41] We're recording this in December towards
[00:02:43] like the beginning of December.
[00:02:46] This won't go out till January.
[00:02:48] So I guess what we can talk about is 2023
[00:02:52] and sort of what you're dealing with for 2023,
[00:02:56] how you're feeling about the market and any ideas
[00:02:59] that you're toying around with.
[00:03:02] I love that.
[00:03:02] I first have to say for those who are watching,
[00:03:05] if I look orange, I am not orange,
[00:03:07] because I feel like this lighting wherever I'm at
[00:03:10] is kind of bad lighting.
[00:03:11] So this is not really what I look like,
[00:03:15] but and I have not gotten a suntan.
[00:03:17] So that's kind of strange.
[00:03:19] So anyways, well, happy 2023 to everybody.
[00:03:23] We are recording this in December,
[00:03:25] but I'm planning and doing all of my due diligence
[00:03:28] to start the year off right.
[00:03:30] And I wanted just to kick it off by giving a little bit
[00:03:35] of success to everybody for 2023.
[00:03:39] Our market's a little funky,
[00:03:41] but I a true believer that it's going to be a good year.
[00:03:46] It's going to be a good year for us.
[00:03:47] But I wanted just to say being authentic
[00:03:51] and leading with kindness is going to be your plan for 2023.
[00:03:55] And I think that everyone should start 2023
[00:03:58] with a game plan of having a defined business plan.
[00:04:03] I think that is key.
[00:04:05] And my success, and I've been doing this for 22 years.
[00:04:09] So I have a good track record of success.
[00:04:12] And my success has been built on being authentic
[00:04:16] and leading with kindness.
[00:04:17] It sounds so simple, it sounds so easy, and it truly is.
[00:04:22] And I truly believe that having authentic actions
[00:04:27] and everything that you do is key to making
[00:04:30] high impact personal connections with people.
[00:04:34] And we are all in real estate,
[00:04:36] connecting with other people, connecting with your clients,
[00:04:40] connecting with your vendors, connecting with colleagues
[00:04:44] is the core of your business.
[00:04:47] And think about it.
[00:04:47] Again, we're in a relationship type business, right?
[00:04:51] And relationships are going to drive your sales,
[00:04:54] they're going to generate your leads,
[00:04:56] they're going to build your credibility,
[00:04:59] but you have to be genuine.
[00:05:01] I've been with people and I'm sure you have too
[00:05:04] that you know that it's fake, you know that it's not real.
[00:05:09] But if you are genuine, it can be extremely effective.
[00:05:13] And I've also done that with my brand,
[00:05:16] just like you were saying is with social media
[00:05:19] or with any type of advertising that you do,
[00:05:24] be your own brand ambassador.
[00:05:27] Yes, I look at other brands and I find inspiration in them
[00:05:30] or I listen to other podcasts or I do,
[00:05:33] you know, a lot of research and I get inspired by other brands,
[00:05:36] but if you are your own brand ambassador
[00:05:40] and you are truly authentic to what you do,
[00:05:43] consumers will respond to that.
[00:05:46] I think you're right.
[00:05:47] I think authenticity really trumps sort of the aesthetic
[00:05:54] of what we think we should look like
[00:05:57] or what we should present to the public,
[00:05:59] sort of the image that we want people to see us at
[00:06:03] is needs to be in alignment with who you actually are as a person.
[00:06:07] So if you're like a female REALTOR and you just are somebody
[00:06:10] that isn't somebody that spends a lot of time
[00:06:14] on their visual, you know, their physical appearance,
[00:06:16] like they're not putting out a ton of makeup
[00:06:17] or they don't, you know, maybe you don't wear certain types
[00:06:19] of clothing or do your hair a certain way.
[00:06:21] I would, I would lean into that and just be like,
[00:06:25] I'm the agent who doesn't, you know,
[00:06:28] do a lot of makeup or hair if that's, you know,
[00:06:30] you don't have to look differently than you are because you're ultimately,
[00:06:34] I mean, you should probably just look professional and all of that.
[00:06:36] But if you're, you know, I have friends,
[00:06:39] I have some very good friends who are women who just have very different styles
[00:06:44] than maybe what we think of when we see a billboard with a REALTOR's face on it.
[00:06:49] And they lean into the fact that that's just their different,
[00:06:51] they have different preferences and they're the people that want to work
[00:06:55] with them. We're going to respond to that because it's authentic versus,
[00:06:59] hey, I look perfect and I think, I think this need to look to sort of look
[00:07:04] and appear perfect takes away from the authenticity,
[00:07:07] which is, you know, look, we don't have to be perfect.
[00:07:10] We don't have to even act perfectly.
[00:07:12] We just have to be ourselves.
[00:07:14] And I think people relate way more to imperfection than perfection anyway.
[00:07:18] I do too. And, you know, speaking of being kind, you know,
[00:07:22] sometimes kindness can be mistaken as a weakness, right?
[00:07:27] And there's that old saying that nice guys finish last.
[00:07:30] And I think that that's so untrue.
[00:07:33] I don't know who started that one, but I totally disagree with that.
[00:07:36] I find that when you are authentically kind, you know,
[00:07:39] doors are going to open, people will smile back at you.
[00:07:42] Your business will just grow.
[00:07:44] And to me, it's kind of like karma.
[00:07:46] What you give out is going to come back to you.
[00:07:48] So, you know, think about when you look at, like,
[00:07:52] I always like to focus on like who are the successful leaders out there?
[00:07:56] Who are the successful managers or sales team?
[00:08:01] And you're going to see that they all have something very common.
[00:08:04] Their common traits, they have the ability to understand people,
[00:08:09] understand their co-workers, understand their clients.
[00:08:12] They listen.
[00:08:13] That's another big thing for 2023.
[00:08:15] Everybody out there listen to your clients, listen to their needs,
[00:08:18] their desires, even their frustrations listen to that.
[00:08:21] Their dreams or challenges.
[00:08:23] When you really listen, you know, you're not talking too much.
[00:08:28] You got to listen to them.
[00:08:28] You're going to understand.
[00:08:31] And these successful people, they understand the drivers of change and
[00:08:35] they strive to make that people happy and keep in mind, kindness is a choice.
[00:08:39] And you got to choose it.
[00:08:41] I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor,
[00:08:45] our one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss.
[00:08:48] Now, after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for this podcast,

[00:09:59] And now back to our episode.
[00:10:03] Yeah, you do.
[00:10:04] And and I think you're right.
[00:10:06] I don't think nice guys finished last.
[00:10:08] I think I think maybe there was a time in our culture where that was
[00:10:13] more true, but it was not in my lifetime really.
[00:10:17] I found that maybe in the 80s, it was a little different.
[00:10:20] If you were, you know, of a certain age, then maybe there was a little bit more of like,
[00:10:24] just grind it out and be the be the very best and crush the competition.
[00:10:29] But I think that nice people are oftentimes you just so valued by employers.
[00:10:35] They're valued by your team.
[00:10:36] If you're on a team, they're valued by, you know, any any any time you can help
[00:10:40] somebody. It really it really tends to come back.
[00:10:42] I find in this industry because it's such a collaborative industry.
[00:10:46] Yeah, so I agree.
[00:10:47] I have a marketing thought that I wanted to I'm a little nervous because I
[00:10:51] I'm a feeling that I may not be thinking about this entirely fully.
[00:10:55] So I am going to lean on you a top top top producer to tell me if you think this
[00:11:00] if this about this idea is an emeric because I was thinking about for 2023.
[00:11:05] Right now, obviously market is challenged.
[00:11:08] The rates are up.
[00:11:08] Inventory is still down.
[00:11:10] Yes, we all know this.
[00:11:11] So we're probably all a little nervous about 2023 or at least everybody I talked to
[00:11:15] seems to be so it's thinking, OK, what's one proactive thing you can do?
[00:11:18] Well, we also know that home prices have probably fallen over the last couple of
[00:11:24] years, least a little bit.
[00:11:25] Most markets, not not in every case.
[00:11:28] But I also know that like 100 and some million people,
[00:11:32] unique people, 100 and some unique, a million, a unique individuals every
[00:11:38] month go to Zillow.
[00:11:39] This is just in the US.
[00:11:41] So you know, a lot of the country is checking Zillow every so often.
[00:11:46] Now what's the first thing that people do if they own a home and they go to Zillow,
[00:11:49] they check to see what the price of their home may be worth according to the
[00:11:53] Zestimate.
[00:11:53] And as REALTORS, I don't I can hear the collective groans.
[00:11:56] Yes, Zestiments are problematic.
[00:11:59] We don't like them.
[00:12:00] They're not always accurate.
[00:12:01] People think they're accurate.
[00:12:02] And then you have to come in and save the day.
[00:12:04] Well, OK, so that's sort of the situation.
[00:12:06] We all know people are checking.
[00:12:08] I even check the Zestimate even though I just it's just the quickest and easiest way
[00:12:12] for me to get an idea of what my place might be worth, even though I'm in no,
[00:12:16] not ready in any way to sell.
[00:12:18] But it's kind of a fun little thing.
[00:12:19] It's like checking your credit store once in a while.
[00:12:21] I don't know how they figure it out, but it's there and it does feel good.
[00:12:24] Whether it's a high credit score number or high Zestimate.
[00:12:27] So, but we also know as REALTORS, it's not probably super accurate.
[00:12:30] That's where you guys come in because obviously Zestiments can't take into a
[00:12:35] account every possible eventuality in the market and so whatever.
[00:12:38] It's just a guess.
[00:12:39] So if it was me, I'm here's my idea.
[00:12:42] I would reach out to everybody.
[00:12:44] You know that owns a home in early 2023 and say, Hey, I was just browsing around
[00:12:49] on Zillow and I noticed the Zestimate for your home is X.
[00:12:53] And I also know that when people see that they're not always sure is that accurate?
[00:12:56] Is that not?
[00:12:57] I would love to have a quick conversation with you and just give you my update on
[00:13:01] what I actually think your home might be worth.
[00:13:03] And yeah, maybe the number will be less or higher than what I found here,
[00:13:08] but I just thought maybe you deserve to get an actual number just so that you
[00:13:12] can keep and keep on top of what's going on with your home.
[00:13:15] So the risk here is of course, you know, maybe the number is much lower than
[00:13:19] the person wants to see or maybe it's higher, but I just like the idea of the
[00:13:24] REALTOR adding value going, Hey, I just wanted to give you an update here.
[00:13:27] Here it is.
[00:13:28] So that was my thought.
[00:13:29] What are your thoughts about that?
[00:13:30] What's is there are their pros and cons to doing that?
[00:13:33] That's interesting.
[00:13:34] You know, it's funny that I've never really gone and look at the Zestimates to be
[00:13:38] honest.
[00:13:38] I think any outreach to a client and giving them information is 100% always a
[00:13:44] great idea and educating them on what a Zestimate is.
[00:13:48] And I always tell people's estimates not even a real word.
[00:13:52] I mean, it's an algorithm really what that is doing.
[00:13:55] All it is.
[00:13:56] And sometimes it's a good number and sometimes it's a bad number.
[00:13:59] But again, our jobs as professionals is to give them the true market value of
[00:14:03] the home.
[00:14:04] So I like your approach.
[00:14:06] I will give that a thumbs up because it's doing that.
[00:14:10] That's what we should do.
[00:14:10] A thumbs up or thumbs down on your ideas, but I give you a thumbs up because
[00:14:14] it's an outreach to the client and it's giving, you know, information to them
[00:14:19] or at least starting that dialogue about where the market is at.
[00:14:23] I believe and I'll have to look into this a little bit, but I do believe with
[00:14:26] Zillow, you can claim your home, right?
[00:14:30] And you can go in there and add some of the details and facts of your home.
[00:14:34] Because Zillow doesn't know.
[00:14:35] Do you have a basement?
[00:14:36] Do you have a two car garage?
[00:14:37] Do you have, you know, whatever the features are of your home, you can go in as a
[00:14:42] homeowner, claim your home, add your features and that will change your
[00:14:47] Zestimate of your home.
[00:14:49] Because Zillow now will aggregate that data to like homes with the same kind of
[00:14:54] information.
[00:14:55] So I'll look into that and just see.
[00:14:57] Yeah, it's interesting because I was at a Zillow event earlier this year and
[00:15:01] they claim that their Zestimate is within three percentage points of of
[00:15:08] accuracy plus or minus three percentage points.
[00:15:11] So I can I, I don't know if that's true, but it's certainly something that
[00:15:15] people look at.
[00:15:16] So I was just thinking you should be looking at what your clients look at.
[00:15:20] So if they're looking at that, you should be there to say, Hey, that number
[00:15:22] actually looks really good or no, I'm going to run some some more
[00:15:25] comps. I'm going to give you a better answer.
[00:15:27] And then you solidify yourself as the person that they can still go look at
[00:15:31] the Zestimate, but you're the one that comes into kind of verify the numbers.
[00:15:35] Just like a financial advisor might call you and say, I want to tell you about
[00:15:38] how the market did this year.
[00:15:39] I want to talk about how your investments did in relation to the market.
[00:15:42] So I'm just sort of thinking more along that.
[00:15:44] It's just a reason to pick up the phone.
[00:15:46] 100% it's a reason to pick up the phone.
[00:15:48] I think always I've done more of that to this past year in 2022 is picking up
[00:15:53] the phone and talking to my clients and they absolutely love it.
[00:15:57] So I think that should be a strategy to for 2023 for REALTORS listening is
[00:16:01] is pick up the phone, give a purpose of your call and provide value.
[00:16:06] And I think just like you're talking about with the this estimate, it's
[00:16:09] providing some value of where their investment is at.
[00:16:12] Yeah, I would say I'm less texting this the next year.
[00:16:15] I mean, text when you have like easy put something simple things, but when you're
[00:16:19] talking to clients, I think nobody's calling them anyway.
[00:16:22] They're not getting calls from their friends, probably everyone's texting,
[00:16:26] everyone's on social media.
[00:16:27] This is a way to go back a step and say, Hey, I was thinking about you.
[00:16:32] And I just think, you know, hey, I was wanted to just talk touch base.
[00:16:35] See how everything's going.
[00:16:36] I think that those are and a lot of people won't even answer the phone.
[00:16:39] Anyway, so you're going to get a ton of voice mails and you can leave.
[00:16:42] That's even easier.
[00:16:43] You can leave like a voice mail.
[00:16:44] Hey, I was just thinking about you.
[00:16:45] I hope you're doing well.
[00:16:46] Let's talk to you soon.
[00:16:47] And there's a company that a lot of people use is called slide dial.
[00:16:50] Oh, sure.
[00:16:51] You know, and they just do their slide dial messages to people.
[00:16:55] I have not crossed over into that yet, but I hear a lot of brokers do use that
[00:17:00] that service.
[00:17:01] Yeah.
[00:17:01] So slide dial bypasses the ring and goes right into somebody's voice mail.
[00:17:06] And it's pretty accurate.
[00:17:07] It'll get it right about 80% of the time.
[00:17:10] The rest of the time, it just won't work.
[00:17:12] But it is a, it's like four cents, a call.
[00:17:15] They're really cheap three cents, maybe.
[00:17:17] So it's absolutely a good idea.
[00:17:19] If you want to sort of blanket call everyone, just be careful.
[00:17:22] Cause those, those calls can sound recorded a little bit.
[00:17:26] So you have to be really careful how you record it and listen back to make it
[00:17:30] sure it doesn't seem like a recording.
[00:17:32] Cause then people probably wouldn't respond well.
[00:17:34] But we, I use slide dial to.
[00:17:36] So what do you do?
[00:17:37] Okay.
[00:17:37] Yeah.
[00:17:38] Well, sometimes we do it for our own brokers because we have like
[00:17:41] 800 agents.
[00:17:42] So one of the easy, like we text everybody, but then we also drop a voice mail
[00:17:45] and hey, this thing's coming up.
[00:17:46] Just want to make sure you know.
[00:17:48] So, but it's, it's a great way to reach as many people as you can very quickly
[00:17:52] and very cheaply.
[00:17:53] And if you have thousands of past clients like you do, that's going to be very hard
[00:17:57] to call everybody.
[00:17:57] So, so that's, that's a good way to just do something.
[00:18:00] Or you can also do bulk texting too.
[00:18:02] There is ways to do that.
[00:18:04] Even through an iPhone, there are little hacks around that.
[00:18:06] So maybe we can cover that in another way.
[00:18:08] I'm just going to say the phone calls.
[00:18:09] I like those.
[00:18:10] Me too.
[00:18:11] Well, Carrie is, this is the end of the year.
[00:18:14] And we wanted to keep this one short and sweet.
[00:18:16] And also, while this will be January, but we're recording this, of course, in
[00:18:19] December, wanted to thank Carrie.
[00:18:21] She has been with us since the very, very beginning.
[00:18:23] And we are so grateful to have her in her insight.
[00:18:26] We don't, we don't get, usually when we get top producers, they do one
[00:18:30] episode with us.
[00:18:30] And then they are off to run their business and Carrie still makes time for us
[00:18:34] every month that we are so honored and grateful to have her.
[00:18:37] She always has amazing insight.
[00:18:38] And really everybody listening, she just do everything she says because she
[00:18:42] gets results.
[00:18:42] She gets results.
[00:18:44] All right.
[00:18:45] But I want everyone to visit her on her Instagram page, which is at Carrie
[00:18:50] McCormick real estate.
[00:18:51] Also, if you are a buyer, a seller, an investor, or maybe you are another
[00:18:58] REALTOR who is thinking about partnering up with somebody, I don't know if
[00:19:02] Carrie's team is currently looking for someone else.
[00:19:04] But I know I would want to make friends with Carrie if I was thinking about
[00:19:08] exploring other options.
[00:19:09] Or if you have a client, maybe that's moving to the Chicago land area, I know
[00:19:13] Carrie's worked with a lot of transplants, people that come in from other
[00:19:17] cities.
[00:19:18] And you actually worked with the big, a big wig at a company.
[00:19:22] My friend works for up in Michigan who ended up moving to this area.
[00:19:26] So Carrie is a great person for anyone movie to Chicago.
[00:19:30] If you're a REALTOR in another market and she might have somebody who's
[00:19:34] moving to your area too.
[00:19:35] So reach out to her.
[00:19:36] Carrie, what's the best way someone should reach out if they want to work with
[00:19:39] you?
[00:19:39] Always call me 312 9614612.
[00:19:44] Awesome.
[00:19:44] All right, Carrie.
[00:19:45] Well, thank you for another year of service to our audience.
[00:19:48] And thank you.
[00:19:49] We're so, I mean, just it's just amazing.
[00:19:51] By the way, Carrie does like, I won't even go into your production, but it is,
[00:19:56] it is well over the hundreds of millions of dollars of production every year.
[00:20:01] So she is, she is just that busy.
[00:20:04] Probably closing a home every three or four days or so.
[00:20:07] So we appreciate it.
[00:20:09] And I hope you have a great 2023.
[00:20:11] I'm sure you will.
[00:20:13] And it'll be great to hear how a top producer stays positive this year and
[00:20:18] stays productive because, of course, you're dealing with the same challenges
[00:20:21] that everyone else will be dealing with.
[00:20:22] Always be kind, be positive and you'll have a great year.
[00:20:27] Well said.
[00:20:28] All right, everyone.
[00:20:28] We'll see you on our next episode and let's all have a great 2023.
[00:20:32] And tell a friend about this show.
[00:20:34] That's the how big.
[00:20:35] That's the way you can help us grow our audience and have a great 2023.
[00:20:39] It's just tell one other REALTOR.
[00:20:41] Look, everybody knows a REALTOR that is pressed, that is stressed, that is going,
[00:20:44] I don't know what I'm going to do.
[00:20:46] This is the time to send them a link to this episode.
[00:20:48] Our episodes are about giving people hope and understanding how to keep them
[00:20:52] on track while the market's a little tricky.
[00:20:55] So let's let's share this episode with this many, many agents as we can.
[00:20:59] All right.
[00:21:00] Carrie, we will see you again next month.
[00:21:03] Thank you so much.

Carrie, welcome once again. Hi there. How are you? I'm good. I'm good. Good. We're recording this in December towards like the beginning of December. This won't go out till January. So I guess what we can talk about is 2023 and sort of what you're dealing with for 2023, how you're feeling about the market and any ideas that you're toying around with. I love that. I first have to say for those who are watching, if I look orange, I am not orange, because I feel like this lighting wherever I'm at is kind of bad lighting. So this is not really what I look like, but and I have not gotten a suntan. So that's kind of strange. So anyways, well, happy 2023 to everybody. We are recording this in December, but I'm planning and doing all of my due diligence to start the year off right. And I wanted just to kick it off by giving a little bit of success to everybody for 2023. Our market's a little funky, but I a true believer that it's going to be a good year. It's going to be a good year for us. But I wanted just to say being authentic and leading with kindness is going to be your plan for 2023. And I think that everyone should start 2023 with a game plan of having a defined business plan. I think that is key. And my success, and I've been doing this for 22 years. So I have a good track record of success. And my success has been built on being authentic and leading with kindness. It sounds so simple, it sounds so easy, and it truly is. And I truly believe that having authentic actions and everything that you do is key to making high impact personal connections with people. And we are all in real estate, connecting with other people, connecting with your clients, connecting with your vendors, connecting with colleagues is the core of your business. And think about it. Again, we're in a relationship type business, right? And relationships are going to drive your sales, they're going to generate your leads, they're going to build your credibility, but you have to be genuine. I've been with people and I'm sure you have too that you know that it's fake, you know that it's not real. But if you are genuine, it can be extremely effective. And I've also done that with my brand, just like you were saying is with social media or with any type of advertising that you do, be your own brand ambassador. Yes, I look at other brands and I find inspiration in them or I listen to other podcasts or I do, you know, a lot of research and I get inspired by other brands, but if you are your own brand ambassador and you are truly authentic to what you do, consumers will respond to that. I think you're right. I think authenticity really trumps sort of the aesthetic of what we think we should look like or what we should present to the public, sort of the image that we want people to see us at is needs to be in alignment with who you actually are as a person. So if you're like a female REALTOR and you just are somebody that isn't somebody that spends a lot of time on their visual, you know, their physical appearance, like they're not putting out a ton of makeup or they don't, you know, maybe you don't wear certain types of clothing or do your hair a certain way. I would, I would lean into that and just be like, I'm the agent who doesn't, you know, do a lot of makeup or hair if that's, you know, you don't have to look differently than you are because you're ultimately, I mean, you should probably just look professional and all of that. But if you're, you know, I have friends, I have some very good friends who are women who just have very different styles than maybe what we think of when we see a billboard with a REALTOR's face on it. And they lean into the fact that that's just their different, they have different preferences and they're the people that want to work with them. We're going to respond to that because it's authentic versus, hey, I look perfect and I think, I think this need to look to sort of look and appear perfect takes away from the authenticity, which is, you know, look, we don't have to be perfect. We don't have to even act perfectly. We just have to be ourselves. And I think people relate way more to imperfection than perfection anyway. I do too. And, you know, speaking of being kind, you know, sometimes kindness can be mistaken as a weakness, right? And there's that old saying that nice guys finish last. And I think that that's so untrue. I don't know who started that one, but I totally disagree with that. I find that when you are authentically kind, you know, doors are going to open, people will smile back at you. Your business will just grow. And to me, it's kind of like karma. What you give out is going to come back to you. So, you know, think about when you look at, like, I always like to focus on like who are the successful leaders out there? Who are the successful managers or sales team? And you're going to see that they all have something very common. Their common traits, they have the ability to understand people, understand their co-workers, understand their clients. They listen. That's another big thing for 2023. Everybody out there listen to your clients, listen to their needs, their desires, even their frustrations listen to that. Their dreams or challenges. When you really listen, you know, you're not talking too much. You got to listen to them. You're going to understand. And these successful people, they understand the drivers of change and they strive to make that people happy and keep in mind, kindness is a choice. And you got to choose it. I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor, our one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss. Now, after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for this podcast, do you know which CRM is used by more than any other by our guests? Of course, it is follow up boss. And let's face it, following up is the key to taking your business to the next level. Follow up boss will help you drive more leads in less time and with less effort. Do not take my word for it. Robert Slack, who runs the number one team in the US, uses follow up boss and he is built of one and a half billion dollar business in just six years. Follow up boss integrates with over 250 systems. So you can keep your current tools and lead sources. Also the best part, they have seven day a week support. So you'll get the help that you need when you need it and get this. Follow up boss is so sure that you're going to love their CRM that for a limited time, they're offering keeping it real listeners a 30 day free trial, which is twice as much time as they give everyone else. And oh, yeah, no credit card required. So you can try it risk free, but only if you use this special link, visit follow up boss dot com forward slash real. That's follow up boss dot com forward slash real for your free 30 day trial. Follow up like a boss with follow up boss. And now back to our episode. Yeah, you do. And and I think you're right. I don't think nice guys finished last. I think I think maybe there was a time in our culture where that was more true, but it was not in my lifetime really. I found that maybe in the 80s, it was a little different. If you were, you know, of a certain age, then maybe there was a little bit more of like, just grind it out and be the be the very best and crush the competition. But I think that nice people are oftentimes you just so valued by employers. They're valued by your team. If you're on a team, they're valued by, you know, any any any time you can help somebody. It really it really tends to come back. I find in this industry because it's such a collaborative industry. Yeah, so I agree. I have a marketing thought that I wanted to I'm a little nervous because I I'm a feeling that I may not be thinking about this entirely fully. So I am going to lean on you a top top top producer to tell me if you think this if this about this idea is an emeric because I was thinking about for 2023. Right now, obviously market is challenged. The rates are up. Inventory is still down. Yes, we all know this. So we're probably all a little nervous about 2023 or at least everybody I talked to seems to be so it's thinking, OK, what's one proactive thing you can do? Well, we also know that home prices have probably fallen over the last couple of years, least a little bit. Most markets, not not in every case. But I also know that like 100 and some million people, unique people, 100 and some unique, a million, a unique individuals every month go to Zillow. This is just in the US. So you know, a lot of the country is checking Zillow every so often. Now what's the first thing that people do if they own a home and they go to Zillow, they check to see what the price of their home may be worth according to the Zestimate. And as REALTORS, I don't I can hear the collective groans. Yes, Zestiments are problematic. We don't like them. They're not always accurate. People think they're accurate. And then you have to come in and save the day. Well, OK, so that's sort of the situation. We all know people are checking. I even check the Zestimate even though I just it's just the quickest and easiest way for me to get an idea of what my place might be worth, even though I'm in no, not ready in any way to sell. But it's kind of a fun little thing. It's like checking your credit store once in a while. I don't know how they figure it out, but it's there and it does feel good. Whether it's a high credit score number or high Zestimate. So, but we also know as REALTORS, it's not probably super accurate. That's where you guys come in because obviously Zestiments can't take into a account every possible eventuality in the market and so whatever. It's just a guess. So if it was me, I'm here's my idea. I would reach out to everybody. You know that owns a home in early 2023 and say, Hey, I was just browsing around on Zillow and I noticed the Zestimate for your home is X. And I also know that when people see that they're not always sure is that accurate? Is that not? I would love to have a quick conversation with you and just give you my update on what I actually think your home might be worth. And yeah, maybe the number will be less or higher than what I found here, but I just thought maybe you deserve to get an actual number just so that you can keep and keep on top of what's going on with your home. So the risk here is of course, you know, maybe the number is much lower than the person wants to see or maybe it's higher, but I just like the idea of the REALTOR adding value going, Hey, I just wanted to give you an update here. Here it is. So that was my thought. What are your thoughts about that? What's is there are their pros and cons to doing that? That's interesting. You know, it's funny that I've never really gone and look at the Zestimates to be honest. I think any outreach to a client and giving them information is 100% always a great idea and educating them on what a Zestimate is. And I always tell people's estimates not even a real word. I mean, it's an algorithm really what that is doing. All it is. And sometimes it's a good number and sometimes it's a bad number. But again, our jobs as professionals is to give them the true market value of the home. So I like your approach. I will give that a thumbs up because it's doing that. That's what we should do. A thumbs up or thumbs down on your ideas, but I give you a thumbs up because it's an outreach to the client and it's giving, you know, information to them or at least starting that dialogue about where the market is at. I believe and I'll have to look into this a little bit, but I do believe with Zillow, you can claim your home, right? And you can go in there and add some of the details and facts of your home. Because Zillow doesn't know. Do you have a basement? Do you have a two car garage? Do you have, you know, whatever the features are of your home, you can go in as a homeowner, claim your home, add your features and that will change your Zestimate of your home. Because Zillow now will aggregate that data to like homes with the same kind of information. So I'll look into that and just see. Yeah, it's interesting because I was at a Zillow event earlier this year and they claim that their Zestimate is within three percentage points of of accuracy plus or minus three percentage points. So I can I, I don't know if that's true, but it's certainly something that people look at. So I was just thinking you should be looking at what your clients look at. So if they're looking at that, you should be there to say, Hey, that number actually looks really good or no, I'm going to run some some more comps. I'm going to give you a better answer. And then you solidify yourself as the person that they can still go look at the Zestimate, but you're the one that comes into kind of verify the numbers. Just like a financial advisor might call you and say, I want to tell you about how the market did this year. I want to talk about how your investments did in relation to the market. So I'm just sort of thinking more along that. It's just a reason to pick up the phone. 100% it's a reason to pick up the phone. I think always I've done more of that to this past year in 2022 is picking up the phone and talking to my clients and they absolutely love it. So I think that should be a strategy to for 2023 for REALTORS listening is is pick up the phone, give a purpose of your call and provide value. And I think just like you're talking about with the this estimate, it's providing some value of where their investment is at. Yeah, I would say I'm less texting this the next year. I mean, text when you have like easy put something simple things, but when you're talking to clients, I think nobody's calling them anyway. They're not getting calls from their friends, probably everyone's texting, everyone's on social media. This is a way to go back a step and say, Hey, I was thinking about you. And I just think, you know, hey, I was wanted to just talk touch base. See how everything's going. I think that those are and a lot of people won't even answer the phone. Anyway, so you're going to get a ton of voice mails and you can leave. That's even easier. You can leave like a voice mail. Hey, I was just thinking about you. I hope you're doing well. Let's talk to you soon. And there's a company that a lot of people use is called slide dial. Oh, sure. You know, and they just do their slide dial messages to people. I have not crossed over into that yet, but I hear a lot of brokers do use that that service. Yeah. So slide dial bypasses the ring and goes right into somebody's voice mail. And it's pretty accurate. It'll get it right about 80% of the time. The rest of the time, it just won't work. But it is a, it's like four cents, a call. They're really cheap three cents, maybe. So it's absolutely a good idea. If you want to sort of blanket call everyone, just be careful. Cause those, those calls can sound recorded a little bit. So you have to be really careful how you record it and listen back to make it sure it doesn't seem like a recording. Cause then people probably wouldn't respond well. But we, I use slide dial to. So what do you do? Okay. Yeah. Well, sometimes we do it for our own brokers because we have like 800 agents. So one of the easy, like we text everybody, but then we also drop a voice mail and hey, this thing's coming up. Just want to make sure you know. So, but it's, it's a great way to reach as many people as you can very quickly and very cheaply. And if you have thousands of past clients like you do, that's going to be very hard to call everybody. So, so that's, that's a good way to just do something. Or you can also do bulk texting too. There is ways to do that. Even through an iPhone, there are little hacks around that. So maybe we can cover that in another way. I'm just going to say the phone calls. I like those. Me too. Well, Carrie is, this is the end of the year. And we wanted to keep this one short and sweet. And also, while this will be January, but we're recording this, of course, in December, wanted to thank Carrie. She has been with us since the very, very beginning. And we are so grateful to have her in her insight. We don't, we don't get, usually when we get top producers, they do one episode with us. And then they are off to run their business and Carrie still makes time for us every month that we are so honored and grateful to have her. She always has amazing insight. And really everybody listening, she just do everything she says because she gets results. She gets results. All right. But I want everyone to visit her on her Instagram page, which is at Carrie McCormick real estate. Also, if you are a buyer, a seller, an investor, or maybe you are another REALTOR who is thinking about partnering up with somebody, I don't know if Carrie's team is currently looking for someone else. But I know I would want to make friends with Carrie if I was thinking about exploring other options. Or if you have a client, maybe that's moving to the Chicago land area, I know Carrie's worked with a lot of transplants, people that come in from other cities.
