[00:01:17] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team? Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:29] But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now.
[00:01:45] And which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you now. I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration. This is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:58] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer.
[00:02:14] So now when I'm recruiting corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:23] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now onto the show.

[00:04:15] ["The Best Piece of Advice"]
[00:04:16] All right, what's the best piece of advice you've received real estate?
[00:04:24] Um, the best piece of advice that I've received is stop trying to do everything yourself.
[00:04:31] So once I started delegating away and really structuring my business with processes and people,
[00:04:38] my business just grew and stress went down.
[00:04:41] So that's probably the best word of advice that I've received.
[00:04:44] Worst piece of advice?
[00:04:46] Just work harder. So in real estate you can always find more to do, right?
[00:04:52] And I think we're all very competitive. We talked about this together earlier on the call.
[00:04:56] And I think systems and people beat hustle a lot, right? So it goes back to the people,
[00:05:03] delegation, getting the right people in place will really let you scale and you don't have to work
[00:05:07] hard. You just got to really work smarter. So.
[00:05:09] Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense because you're right. We can always be busy and that can
[00:05:14] feel productive. And then if we were reflect on what we've done over that time period, it's not
[00:05:20] always productive. And I know I fall into that trap. So I appreciate that advice by guest today.
[00:05:26] Is Jared Jarvis from Second City Agents with Compass? He is in Chicago. Let me tell you more about
[00:05:32] Jared. Jared is a licensed real estate agent with Compass Realty who is sold over 200 homes and
[00:05:37] has been featured on HDTV, barstable sports and also featured in Real Producers magazine. He is
[00:05:43] also the founder and CEO of Cura, a virtual assistant company that helps real estate agents
[00:05:48] streamline operations, scale their businesses and focus on serving clients. Before transitioning into
[00:05:54] real estate, Jared worked with Fortune 500 companies as a channel marketing specialist, collaborating
[00:05:59] with remodellers, builders and architects, a marketing graduate from Illinois State University.
[00:06:04] He is known for a strong work ethic, creative strategy and deep commitment to his clients.
[00:06:09] Born and raised in Chicago, he now lives in Irving Park with his wife Elise, their daughter Sienna,
[00:06:14] their dog Wyatt and also manages 20 rental units as an active investor. So he's doing a lot.
[00:06:22] I want you to follow Jared at his Instagram on his Instagram, which is Homes of Chicago. And
[00:06:28] check out his virtual assistant company. We're going to be talking about that today. That is
[00:06:32] work with Cura CURA, workwithcura.com. We'll have links to both of those in the show notes. Jared,
[00:06:40] thanks for the intro DJ. That was great. Appreciate it. It's always fun for me to get to know,
[00:06:49] especially people here locally in Chicago do as many Chicago interviews anymore. I started only
[00:06:54] doing Chicago interviews because that was the only people I had the confidence to even ask,
[00:06:58] would you come on my show? Now I don't get to do as many. So I appreciate that. You and I have
[00:07:09] those agents and they're all just great agents and excited to have you have you here. So I want to
[00:07:16] talk a little bit. I love that you have a marketing background. That's my background as well.
[00:07:22] I want to sort of dive into that first and just kind of understand how you think about marketing
[00:07:28] because that is something that you probably bring up a particular skill set where a lot of agents
[00:07:34] struggle on the marketing side. Tell us a little bit about how you market your business.
[00:07:40] I think that brand is everything right. I think as you stated earlier, it's homes of Chicago.
[00:07:47] Right when I started from the beginning, I wanted to be the go-to Chicago agent for real
[00:07:52] estate agents nationwide. I didn't think about actual clients. I thought about how do I get out
[00:07:59] to a broader section of people. So it was a completely different mindset. So my marketing mindset
[00:08:05] is completely the opposite of what people are doing. So if you're going A, I'm going B. Right.
[00:08:10] It's also guerrilla marketing tactics. Right. Like doing different things on social media,
[00:08:15] like top 30 lists. Like one of our videos got 60,000 views. It was and it usually it's top 10.
[00:08:20] Right. It's a top 10 list. Yeah. I said let's do a top 10 of Ramanoodle Soup.
[00:08:24] Soup. Soup. Super random. Have I aided all those places? Maybe. Maybe I haven't. You don't know
[00:08:31] that. But 60,000 people tuned into that video and were requesting and debating about Ramanoodle Soup.
[00:08:38] By the way, I'm going to jump in for a second because this is such a brilliant video. I love Raman
[00:08:44] and there are, there are, you know, maybe a hundred Raman places here and I go or close to it.
[00:08:50] There probably really is about 100 and I every time I always forget which is the best.
[00:08:55] I literally just can't remember because I have a terrible memory and I always go onto Google.
[00:09:01] Well, I guess I would use chat, chbt to help me, but I always go or YouTube and I would say
[00:09:05] or Reddit and I would say it's the very best Raman right now because new ones pop up all the time.
[00:09:11] Sure. And it's so funny that you made that video because that is such a brilliant video because
[00:09:17] I think me would have found that video. I might have found that video and it's just a great idea
[00:09:23] for marketing because yeah, 60,000 people, I mean, the Raman is such a great example of that.
[00:09:28] Yeah, exactly. And I don't think it has to be all about like marketing. You really need to know
[00:09:34] who your target market is, right? And you really need to think outside the box like how can you help
[00:09:40] people with a problem, right? And for our clients, as you know in real estate, they're looking for you
[00:09:46] to be the solution for it's not just the real estate transaction, it's everything in life from
[00:09:53] engagement rings to the best Raman places to, you know, a lot of my followers now are real
[00:09:58] estate around the country because I'm on one of the top teams in Chicago. I'm using virtual
[00:10:03] assistance and now they're looking at me for how what is he using a virtual assistant for, right?
[00:10:08] Like I have been posted on social media this year myself once. It's my VAs, right? I'm behind
[00:10:14] the scenes creating the content like looking at the content, approving the content and stamping it,
[00:10:19] but then it goes out and it's out to the world. So it's been pretty cool.
[00:10:23] Yeah, I love that. I want to dive into this problem solving methodology because
[00:10:28] this is a marketing sort of paradigm shift that once somebody gets it specifically around
[00:10:36] solving problems related to what your clients are experiencing and may not be related to real estate,
[00:10:44] right? Like Raman, it might be dinner, what am I going to have for dinner, or maybe it is real estate
[00:10:50] related tangentially like where's the best grocery store in this particular neighborhood or
[00:10:56] how close to my to the subway system here in Chicago we call the L or things like that or where
[00:11:02] the best places to live for, you know, X, Y or Z. I think those are absolutely how I know that's
[00:11:09] how I search on Lahen and I'm always looking for answers to those questions. I were going on a
[00:11:14] trip to the Northeast in next week and I specifically was looking at like where are the best places
[00:11:21] to visit in May? New Hampshire and Vermont and those are searches I do and those are video searches I
[00:11:26] do and you're right. 60,000 people will find that and what I love about YouTube in particular
[00:11:31] that a lot of agents sort of neglect YouTube and they focus more on Instagram and Facebook and
[00:11:37] TikTok and those are great but those are sort of flash in the pan digestible they go away. They
[00:11:42] don't, I mean they do technically live forever but they don't, the algorithm doesn't really favor
[00:11:47] older content but YouTube does favor older content if it's good and that stuff just lives forever
[00:11:52] and you can continually get leads I'm sure you do. Yeah totally. From those kind of videos so
[00:11:58] you know when you start to think about problems that your clients have it must be pretty fun to
[00:12:04] do that because then you just can think about content creation. Well I mean yeah I mean like one of
[00:12:09] the things I, one of the problems we saw with clients for example was we're moving in a new house
[00:12:15] we need to turn a new furniture. Yeah and if you've moved before DJ you know it's extremely
[00:12:19] expensive to buy furniture. How many agents out there have trade discounts or even know what trade
[00:12:24] discounts are. Like if you have an LLC and you're a real estate agent you can message every major
[00:12:30] top brand out there and you can get 20 to 40% off discount codes that you can provide your clients
[00:12:35] and so just having that sheet to send out to your clients when they move or post it on social media
[00:12:40] if you're like hey like I didn't buy with you I bought with my other this other person like
[00:12:45] why didn't they give me a trade-dice account can you give me the trade? Absolutely like
[00:12:48] like I'll give you the tiny one right and it's that going back to help with
[00:12:57] this and how do you solve that's just an example. That is a great example I've never heard of that so
[00:13:05] I love that so if you have an LLC or an S corporation you have a company for your real estate practice
[00:13:11] as Jared says reach out to the furniture manufacturers and see if they're gosh I didn't know
[00:13:16] DJ you could even reach out to Crater Barrel Crater Barrel has trade discounts right 30% off like
[00:13:21] container store our house all those websites all those different companies. I'm thinking about
[00:13:27] so I'm looking to put my place on the market and I have to get it you know just things patched up and
[00:13:32] and you know scuffs marked out you know that kind of thing and I realized I have this one of my
[00:13:37] one of my I guess baseboards is got some water in it kind of expanded so I have to replace it
[00:13:42] and I'm like I don't know who who does that I mean I can find somebody on tasker and I can just look
[00:13:47] it up but I would much rather go to somebody like you who probably knows who the best handyman are
[00:13:53] and or you know you would have that resource and like I have it a license I don't really use it but
[00:14:00] I don't know who to go to so those are things that people are going with it everybody I always think
[00:14:06] like probably everybody who owns a property could always use a handyman at any given time while
[00:14:11] they're living there like there's always a project that isn't finished totally something to be
[00:14:15] fixed up so handyman stuff is super helpful oh yeah I mean you have to have that especially as our
[00:14:21] careers have progressed we're now getting more into the listings and we have to have a whole team
[00:14:25] come in and quickly get this house up to what the the quality that we like to list right so I mean
[00:14:33] we have two pretty much handyman that are working around at Chicago and area and electrician plumber
[00:14:40] drywall or all that stuff so yeah well let's talk about some trends that you've noticed
[00:14:46] and you know how are buyers and sellers changing these days I know you've mentioned there's been
[00:14:52] some shifts and curious to know sort of what you're witnessing well on the buyer side they are
[00:14:59] definitely hyper focused on the rate I would say because you know this generation saw the
[00:15:06] rates dropped in the 2s and 3s and they don't really understand the concept of why did that happen
[00:15:12] why did it go back so quickly and now it's going down and for example like I have clients under
[00:15:17] contract right now they got a 6.75 interest rate from one mortgage broker and the other one
[00:15:23] just beat him by a half a point wow okay and they're like why does that happen and I'm like that's
[00:15:30] a great question right now did that mortgage broker not lock in the rates the rates went up
[00:15:37] today who knows but I think they're super hyper focused on that I also think that now with
[00:15:42] Chatchee BT and AI they can really really be just really really know a lot more about the home buying
[00:15:50] process at at their fingertips like you can take a photo of an AC unit in Chatchee BT post it and say
[00:15:56] what years this and the serial number instantly tells me how what's the life like expectancy and
[00:16:01] how long how long has been so I would say that and then on the selling side right it's they are
[00:16:07] expecting the house to really be marketed in a very I would say visually impactful way right like
[00:16:19] I had a client the other day was like hey should we virtually stage this like if we take we're
[00:16:23] going to remove all the all the furniture that's in there because it's a renter and we're going
[00:16:28] to virtually stage it and I said hey if you're scrolling through 80 80 places today okay and you see
[00:16:35] a property that's empty okay and then you see a property that has staged furniture virtually staged
[00:16:40] you may not even know if it's virtually staged because it's so good sure but you can envision your
[00:16:44] your dining room table being in that kitchen you can imagine your couch being in that living room
[00:16:49] that gets your minds thinking and slows you down just a little bit from not scrolling every second
[00:16:54] maybe every three seconds I get attached to that house right so I think sellers are really expecting
[00:16:59] us to really step our games up from an artificial standpoint also like listing descriptions like
[00:17:04] you see these listing descriptions that are like 250 400 500 words yeah we're doing a thousand to
[00:17:12] 2000 wow SEO we're trying to get SEO we're trying to get as many views onto those properties as
[00:17:17] possible so for listing descriptions are what's your thought process there for longer descriptions is it
[00:17:24] I want to tell a story is it you know kind of walk me through that a little bit well we gather as
[00:17:30] much details about the mechanics and any updates they don't we do I mean I take photos of every single
[00:17:37] major mechanical product that when we go through the walkthrough right so I have that so they don't
[00:17:43] fill out the whole description of like because they don't know right at the age of the washing machines
[00:17:47] sure we have all that details we then ask them if there's any favorite restaurants shopping or
[00:17:53] parks that they like an area things that they like do with their kids or family and then we take
[00:17:57] all of that data and then we take you know more information about that property as well we put it
[00:18:03] into chat you be tier an AI it spits out you know we put in the MLS rules because it has the MLS rules
[00:18:08] I'll say please audit this to the MLS rules and it provides this amazing content sometimes it will
[00:18:14] put like restaurants in there and you you know I do my due diligence look it up and it's like this
[00:18:18] is we're not going to market a fast food restaurant that has five stars are like five five star reviews
[00:18:23] like there's no one going there right but it gives a really good output and then you know you just
[00:18:28] let the SEO come in which is great so so that's one of the that's how we look at it from a character
[00:18:33] standpoint I love that you're you are all in an AI I am doing a lot with it myself and I'm
[00:18:39] I'm learning and we're doing videos just for anyone listening if you're not currently a subscriber
[00:18:45] to our social channels please do look us up keeping it real where everywhere on all the channels we do
[00:18:51] short form video there where I do an AI prompt two to three times a week for agents that they can
[00:18:55] use to help grow their business and one of the things and I know you do this with your AI prompts
[00:19:00] is really thinking about crafting the query is really the most important way and so I do this with
[00:19:08] YouTube descriptions I suspect you might do the same where I upload a video I put just you know
[00:19:13] my version of a description in and then I have YouTube review the video or sorry I have chat
[00:19:19] GPT review the video and then say acting as an SEO specialist that understands the YouTube algorithm
[00:19:25] and here's who I'm looking to attract to this video here's what here's what I'm looking to with
[00:19:29] the YouTube algorithm to do for me please rewrite the description in a you know engaging way
[00:19:34] and you can really just get hyper specific about it now you know and it always comes up with something
[00:19:39] better than I could have done so totally no I mean and talking to it like that it takes
[00:19:45] a moment for people to write like I want this to be elegant yeah uh a thousand characters uh I
[00:19:51] want you to include restaurants I want you to include local parks uh schools like you have to
[00:19:56] talk to it in a certain way and then you have to give it more details at the end of massage it so
[00:20:00] it's not perfect but like it it gets better and better the more you talk to it which at like
[00:20:04] the pro version at least so well I love that you're using AI you also are really big with virtual
[00:20:10] assistance I am as well I'm all an un virtual assistance they make my life so much better and I'm so
[00:20:16] grateful that we live in a world where I can have people that you know from all over the world who
[00:20:24] are willing to you know work with me they're effective they're efficient they're super knowledgeable
[00:20:30] and let's talk a little bit about it and you you love it so much you created a whole company
[00:20:34] specifically for real estate agents called cura to help them streamline so tell us about cura
[00:20:39] so cura was born out of my need for a virtual assistant um I had a daughter she came home early
[00:20:45] she was born 10 weeks early right oh wow um it was scary like yeah you know my wife was at home and
[00:20:51] she's now amazing she's running around but I realized after she was like six months old I'm like
[00:20:56] I need to delegate things away I can't keep doing be a present father and husband and not be
[00:21:03] there for my clients right I need to let go so I brought on a virtual assistant in 2023
[00:21:09] and you know I had this whole idea of let's email every agent at a certain brokerage okay for the
[00:21:17] for the next year four times and see what happens so we emailed 90,000 emails that year
[00:21:21] love the next year we got four deals and I was like holy cow I got a four X R R R Y on this thing
[00:21:27] so I was at a retreat with a bunch of top agents around the country and they came up to me we're at
[00:21:33] dinner and they go how are you doing all this fine so quickly and what do you like what's the
[00:21:39] secret I said the VA and they're like can you help us find one and so I found two agents of VA
[00:21:44] and then my goal this year was hey let's find one virtual assistant per year or per month to help one
[00:21:51] agent by Easter we had 20 clients and I was like all right I need help so my cousin was the 25th
[00:21:58] employee of Uber and he he was retired and he goes he looked at the numbers and he's like this
[00:22:03] is amazing like tell me about it like what are you passionate about why are you doing this and I told
[00:22:08] them both version why I'm passionate about helping people in the Philippines why I'm passionate
[00:22:11] about helping people here yeah and he's like I'm in so then he came in and then the chief of staff
[00:22:16] for Waymo the self-driving car company whose friends with my cousin heard about it and he's like I'm
[00:22:21] in so it's us three running around you know three crazy guys running around and now we're up to 33
[00:22:27] VA's since pretty much kind of like May we had it you know we had the 20 clients but now we're we
[00:22:32] triple the size of the business in like three months and now we have this business exploded and
[00:22:38] that's why I wrote to you I was like I got I got to tell the world about this right we are a real
[00:22:42] estate specific and what's specific about this I saw all these other VA companies and I said what
[00:22:47] are they doing wrong and the the biggest thing I said they were offering 40 hours a week
[00:22:55] most could you repeat that please you cut out just for a second yeah the biggest problem for
[00:22:59] you hours the biggest problem is agents cannot manage themselves for 40 hours right alone someone else
[00:23:06] yep right so we flipped the script and said it's kind of like a co-op right 10 hour buckets
[00:23:13] so we can have one VA working for two or three agents a lot of time and people can pull the
[00:23:20] resources to use these VA's and these VA's get right I can't afford to pay for someone full time
[00:23:25] yeah I need 10 hours and no one's gonna work just 10 hours for me so I you have a pool of people
[00:23:31] that you can plug and play into their schedules and I can get that 10 hours exactly and the other
[00:23:37] thing to think about is retention so the other VA companies when a VA would lose their when they
[00:23:43] would lose if they lost their client for example like let's say the clients like hey I can't I can't
[00:23:47] afford this this quarter they be out of a job and what happens then they have to feed their families
[00:23:51] yeah so they go to another VA company with us if we lose a client like we had one the other day
[00:23:57] it was like I just can't manage they're like I just don't know how to manage people I just it's
[00:24:01] not for me I'm an individual contributor I'm in New York I'm fast paced I can't slow down like
[00:24:05] that's cool um she that VA has two other clients so they stay with us and they grow and it's seen
[00:24:13] this amazing growth of building things with real estate agents all over the country at different
[00:24:19] brokerages and there's a lot of things with tech you know techs the sex equal thing but at the end
[00:24:25] of the day what we've seen is a lot of these agents they're not using the tech you for sure for sure
[00:24:31] they're not even using the tech so the VA's come in and they learn about the tech then they start
[00:24:37] using the tech right and I think that's that's been a really amazing thing to be able to wake up in
[00:24:44] the morning you know you know we're helping people overseas and also helping people here to
[00:24:48] to provide a better product to clients that are buying all over the country and I feel like I'm
[00:24:54] a part of that every day it's pretty cool really exciting tell us what the VA's some of the tasks
[00:24:59] they can actually do sure I mean I heard a great story today one was a client concierge and
[00:25:05] an agent of ours and she's a really big agent was married to an NFL player in Houston she has one
[00:25:12] of our our VA's calling all of her past clients as the the X team so it looks like they're from
[00:25:19] Houston saying hey we offer a concierge service you need any dinner reservations you need anything
[00:25:24] let us know I love that amazing the other thing is any listing she has is they're calling real
[00:25:30] estate agents throughout that neighborhood an area that has I have done a deal in in those areas
[00:25:35] and saying hey I'm from X Y and Z team we have this listing coming up we just want to let you be
[00:25:39] the first one to know if you have any buyers or you're looking for anything let us know we can get
[00:25:43] you in first and she's like and they're giving daily reports to the clients so the clients are like
[00:25:48] wow like you're everywhere like this is amazing you're cold calling people and then you're giving
[00:25:53] me daily reports on this like no one else is doing that so there's stuff like that's incredible
[00:25:58] incredible to hear and she told us that today so that was pretty that was an awesome story I want to
[00:26:03] go I'm gonna totally break what we were just talking about virtual assistance because I wanted to go
[00:26:07] back I apologize for the non-continuity here but you it's something very important at the beginning
[00:26:12] and I just forgot to go back to it so I'm gonna go back to it now and then we're gonna go back
[00:26:16] in a virtual assistant this is not the way to a structure a well-flowing podcast but I think this
[00:26:22] is super important you said when at the very beginning when we were talking about your marketing
[00:26:26] background you would mention that you've sort of flipped the script and you were more interested in
[00:26:32] building relationships with other agents yes and all over the country which again yes really really
[00:26:38] smart because and I we sort of kind of went past that I want to just real quickly take a quick
[00:26:43] detour let's go into that why did you do that I I knew I wanted referrals inbound and I knew
[00:26:51] long-term I didn't know if it was coaching or something but I knew I loved helping other agents
[00:26:55] and so right now I'm you can call me a manager whatever may be of of three agents on the second
[00:27:01] city agents team and a lot of people don't know that so I help you lie with with half the you know
[00:27:06] a quarter of the team but I loved connecting with other agents around the country almost felt like
[00:27:11] I was like flying in and like traveling when I would connect with them and the biggest deal I've
[00:27:16] ever gotten was I was I remember this day I was mowing my grass and my assistant here locally
[00:27:24] said you just got a message about a referral for 2.1 million dollars come to you and they flew
[00:27:31] in they bought the house and seven months later they were like hey we were here 20 years ago we
[00:27:36] were really not vibing with Ravenswood anymore can you sell the property so that they sold the property
[00:27:41] for I think it was like 250 thousand dollars more and then we bought another house in Winnecco for
[00:27:46] like two million dollars so it was like six million dollars and less than a year from from
[00:27:49] Instagram and it was the from the referral program or just like I just in my mind knew I wanted to
[00:27:56] start having inbound referrals and I knew it was bigger than just Chicago it's everywhere people
[00:28:01] are coming here we live in the third largest city in the richest country in the world and they're
[00:28:06] going to continue to move here right so I love that saying shout out Eli Masood for that line I love
[00:28:10] that line that is such a brilliant idea so really if you don't have an agent network think about adding
[00:28:20] that to your marketing plan and start thinking about how you can help agents in other parts of the
[00:28:26] country and where people who live in your your your area where they move to and where people move
[00:28:33] might move in from that start developing those relationships and building those connections and yeah
[00:28:39] that's what I figured you were doing and I'm so glad that we took that quick detour let's go back
[00:28:44] to the virtual assistant play because uh and virtual assistants can help do this as well they can help
[00:28:48] this is how it started yeah yeah I love this um so talk talk to me more about so I'm an agent
[00:28:55] and I'm I'm doing so many different hat I'm wearing so many different hats I'm doing so many
[00:29:00] different tasks and some things I'm good at some things I like to do other things I'm not as skilled
[00:29:05] at or and some things I just don't like to do as well and but I have to do them right and I
[00:29:11] trying to figure out what I should do and what I should delegate so maybe we should let's start
[00:29:16] there so if you were an agent trying to figure this out I know you've already figured this out for you
[00:29:21] how would you start to think about because I want I want to make the case for is everybody needs a
[00:29:27] virtual assistant here so let's make the case how do you first figure out that you need one
[00:29:33] if everyone on this call or on this podcast is listening and has just thinks is there one thing
[00:29:39] that they could delegate away right now the answer is yes okay so then you've got our group it
[00:29:44] you've got daily you've got weekly you've got monthly and you've got quarterly
[00:29:49] tasks right and then you break that down I have this daily task this person's responsible
[00:29:56] are they trained on that and then you're tracking it okay and then you're analyzing is it working
[00:30:01] for my business and if you start with one task the first week maybe you start with one daily
[00:30:06] task and one weekly task then the second week you add another one and another one and after about
[00:30:11] a month to two months you've got eight daily task going and eight weekly task going and then you
[00:30:16] start adding in projects it's game over I mean driving back from the office to my home office I
[00:30:23] literally got on the phone and needed my assistant to create four emails blasts for different
[00:30:30] listings and upcoming summit I'm going to to speak at like I needed all of this stuff done I
[00:30:36] don't have the time now I'll have the time to approve it or approve read it but I don't have
[00:30:40] the time to build it out and she does and she's also doing all my other daily tasks so if that
[00:30:45] answers your question yes start with one to two things and do you have different VA's who have
[00:30:52] different skill sets doing different things or are they sort of trained in everything we do I always
[00:30:58] say that social media VA's can step back to admin stuff and usually admins can't step up to social
[00:31:03] media so right now we have a director of operations that does is is very proficient in social media
[00:31:09] and does all of our administration stuff and then we have a social media slash like BD person
[00:31:16] that creates a calendar and then every at the beginning of every month she sends me like 15
[00:31:21] you know literally scripts and like what she wants me to do and she says do this record yourself
[00:31:27] and then send it to me I'll make it look pretty and I do it in one day and it's done and I tell her
[00:31:33] to always tell me like a week in advance and then give me a deadline holding accountable to that deadline
[00:31:38] so I I have a virtualist is funny I have a virtual assistant also from the Philippines and I by the way
[00:31:44] I so grateful that the Philippines is a nation that exists as the nicest people on the planet
[00:31:50] who live there and also the hardest working I mean they are just a treasure to to to work with if
[00:31:57] anyone's ever worked with anyone from the Philippines it is it's it's I've never had a back experience
[00:32:02] that I've we have a lot of experience with virtual assistants there and you're really helping them
[00:32:07] tremendously that is that is a country that really benefits from from this exact sort of opportunity
[00:32:15] and I have one her her name's Janika she is my right hand woman and she helps me in business
[00:32:20] she also wakes me up every morning at 6 a.m. and she calls me now it's not 6 a.m. her time of course it's
[00:32:26] like 6 p.m. so it's no big deal for her and she doesn't it's not like I'm this lazy American who's
[00:32:32] like I have to have somebody wake me up no I set my alarm for 555 so that she doesn't actually have
[00:32:37] to call me at 6 but just in case I sleep through it and I don't send her that message at 555 then she
[00:32:44] at 6 a.m. she will you know click on WhatsApp give me a quick call it's time to wake up now in the
[00:32:50] two years she's been doing this for me she's only ever had to call me once or twice and the rest
[00:32:55] is like I'm just too embarrassed so I immediately wake up I go Jenna guy I'm up I'm up but this was
[00:32:59] something I needed because I struggled to get up in the morning and it's you know it's it you can
[00:33:04] have virtual assistants help with this now takes her all of 15 seconds to just you know call me
[00:33:11] whatever it's like no big deal to her she's getting paid for it and I have her helping me schedule
[00:33:17] plan dates with my with my partner with the girlfriend she's saying here's all the cool things
[00:33:21] going on in Chicago this weekend what do you want to do dinner reservations and things like that too
[00:33:26] so you know virtual assistants are so helpful because you know I don't want to spend it's not
[00:33:32] that I don't want to find cool things to do with my girlfriend I do I just don't want to search for
[00:33:37] all the cool things I want all the cool things to come to me and then I just filter through those
[00:33:41] top 30 like or in your case the scripts you're getting for your social media content right you want
[00:33:47] that brought to you and then you can make those decisions much more quickly and then also that
[00:33:51] accountability piece is so important is having you know give me a due date make sure I'm doing it
[00:33:57] and we all need accountability too I love this but it really is this thing that if if you're listening
[00:34:03] and you're like thinking I don't know how to give up that control then work on that because you
[00:34:10] will benefit so much by not digging your your claws into every part of your business and trying
[00:34:17] to hold on to everything and do it yourself you're just not going to be able to this is the bottom
[00:34:21] line and we also know that multitasking it's been well proven it does not work nobody can do it
[00:34:26] virtually nobody is good at multitasking and real estate agents are all having to multitask all
[00:34:33] day long because that's just the nature of the job so virtual assistants can help you do that and
[00:34:37] what I love about cura is that you have specialized people for different tasks because this is a problem
[00:34:44] for people when they start looking into virtual assistants a lot of times they'll go on upwork they'll
[00:34:49] submit you know to try to find someone and then they get 100 resumes and they're like gosh I don't
[00:34:54] know who to choose I don't know you know they can look at reviews and that's good but can this
[00:35:00] person do everything like you said could they do social media and admin tasks probably not
[00:35:04] well if they could do admin tasks they probably can't do social media but the reverse maybe works
[00:35:09] so you really need somebody who's got a team in place specific to real estate stuff and that's
[00:35:18] what you've built and so we're talking about also what I what I love is I'm assuming your virtual
[00:35:25] assistants can also do things like you get a client and then they can start to create a calendar
[00:35:29] you know if you're all the important dates and they can reach out to you and say today's the day
[00:35:34] you need to call so and so and let them know it's 45 days before closing or whatever exactly they
[00:35:39] could do all that so did you did you build a lot of those systems and then train the staff on them
[00:35:44] or are you having where are you picking up some of these systems we're picking up I mean we put a lot
[00:35:50] of we create systems and videos we record them we then have them go through about a month onboarding
[00:35:56] process and then they start working with the real estate agents so there's also we launched
[00:36:01] Cura Academy which is partnered with like another company that essentially they can take
[00:36:05] continue education for free to level them up so we believe that they should continue to learn
[00:36:10] and progress through their career either with us or somewhere else I want them to continue to learn
[00:36:14] and also having like we have monthly jam sessions where we have one of like for example we had
[00:36:20] his name's A.C. He was working for an agent in Nashville and we heard about this amazing
[00:36:25] document that he created Excel document where he plugs all the information in from all of like
[00:36:29] homes.com all the different websites right and then it essentially creates a email he takes that
[00:36:35] email and the listing age it looks at it and then sends it out for his listing report every week
[00:36:40] to his sellers so it's just like stuff like that it gets better and better and better over time
[00:36:44] because we're only working with real estate agents and our VA's are all it's like a roundtable
[00:36:49] of talking and if like they don't know the answer they'll go to one of the other 32 and if the
[00:36:54] 32 don't know it and my VA doesn't know it and I don't know it then it probably doesn't exist
[00:36:58] possibly or we or we do some research on it we figured out. I always think too that CRMs are often
[00:37:05] neglected and not not so much in the daily activities that people use them and know what they
[00:37:10] need to do day to day but in updating the data for the client and a virtual assistant is like the
[00:37:16] perfect person to be able to call every single person in your CRM or past clients and say hey I
[00:37:23] just want to make sure we have your birthday correct in here I just want to make sure we have
[00:37:27] XYZ data in here even if you want to know somebody's you know wedding anniversary or whatever
[00:37:33] information you want maybe their kids ages or birthdays you know you could have that person call
[00:37:37] on behalf of you and say well you know we're updating your data we want to celebrate your birthday
[00:37:41] every year we don't have it what is it when is your birthday and that's a touch point DJ yes
[00:37:46] that's a touch point because they saw that your team reached out and actually cared about them
[00:37:50] and then they remember you right and that's that's where a lot of agents are missing or missing it
[00:37:55] you know that too so it's kind of crazy so it's just small little touches like that just takes
[00:38:00] to the next level yeah let's talk about so if I'm so so I'm an agent I've now thought about
[00:38:07] some tasks that I do for example I some some agents are really great at every day on Facebook they
[00:38:14] see the list of happy birthdays or the birthday you know are the you know it's on LinkedIn as well
[00:38:18] and then they start sending messages to people however they want to do that but that takes takes
[00:38:23] time it's a fairly repetitive task and something that probably could be automated or at least
[00:38:30] delegated rather not automated delegated to a virtual assistant so even things like that
[00:38:36] could be you know super helpful totally I mean transaction coordination chief of staff
[00:38:44] client concierge lead follow up I mean there's so many things that you can delegate away it's wild
[00:38:49] like the one where you have your VA calling I'm like holy cow I should probably implement that
[00:38:53] because I always hits news so at like six a.m you're earlier than me well it's what's funny is
[00:38:59] yeah that's helpful for me but one thing that's really helpful for my relationship is she she will
[00:39:05] say okay you have to plan not my my girlfriend but my virtual assistant I've told her make sure I
[00:39:11] plan at least one date every single week and you know by Wednesday I have to have the date planned
[00:39:18] because if I don't then you know it's gonna be really hard to get it done in time for the weekend
[00:39:22] so yeah so we have a we have a process for even things like that because and another thing she's
[00:39:28] done is even people in my personal life who I want to make sure I stay connected to it and again you
[00:39:33] can translate this over to business is she makes sure that I'm calling my friends every so often I
[00:39:39] want to make sure I'm staying in touch with so and so every 90 days you know just to you know for
[00:39:43] my own personal but again business stuff yeah this is this is all things that virtual assistants
[00:39:48] can absolutely do and keep you productive so if somebody wanted to explore Kira what's the
[00:39:55] process how do they get involved so you go to work with Kira.com you'd fill out the form then we
[00:40:00] have an initial consultation okay and then you would have a interview with the VA's and then from
[00:40:08] there we would have a weekly call with you every single month after that free of charge and then a
[00:40:14] monthly call after that as well so that's reoccurring to just to make sure we value the feedback of
[00:40:20] the agents to hear about like what's going right what's going wrong what are you creating with the
[00:40:24] VA's and just almost like a mastermind group of content and we're just to pump it out as much
[00:40:29] as we can if we find something that's valuable we'll send out to all the agents as well so oh that's
[00:40:34] really cool too yeah some extra like hey so and so in a different total part of the oh I love that
[00:40:40] it's it's a group thing kind of it's like a group thing yep yep yep yeah mastermind yep it's a
[00:40:45] mastermind yeah it's for you people are like people are blown away they're like how are you not
[00:40:49] charging like for at least extra things and I'm like we shouldn't we should make this is but as
[00:40:54] the best possible version it can be and it as simple as possible right and that's what's special
[00:40:59] about it so I think that's why it's been growing so fast that's amazing and you can choose the
[00:41:04] number of hours I'm sure you have packages you have yeah it's all in the west it's all in the
[00:41:08] website you know exactly what the prices are going to be you know exactly how it works and then
[00:41:12] one of us will get in contact with with you as well so what if you estimated because you're a
[00:41:17] data guy what would you estimate your ROI is on a virtual assistant not not as an owner of Kura but
[00:41:24] just as an agent yourself well for me I mean it was 4x last year I mean I mean I I brought in I
[00:41:31] think I spent like $10,000 last year and I brought in about 40,000 on and it was specifically though
[00:41:36] like I could tie it it was emails outbound bulk emails the agents saw them they emailed me back
[00:41:42] said hey I have a client I saw your email a couple months prior because they don't delete their
[00:41:46] emails right there in the inbox so they searched they searched Chicago because we send 4 emails a
[00:41:51] year about cool things about the city we love like the best tropical restaurants stuff that's really
[00:41:56] out there right marketing right and and then I also bonus my VA as well because you did this work
[00:42:03] you should be incentivized as well just like me so but then I hear stories like in Houston where
[00:42:08] she got three listings for like four million dollars from calling just calling past clients
[00:42:13] just saying hey we're checking in how are you doing oh hey could you come by I want to possibly
[00:42:19] sell my house I didn't even know that till today she her name's Alicia she told me this I was like wow
[00:42:23] that's that's incredible so the ROI I mean it's endless on it if you get one deal it pretty much
[00:42:29] pays for VA right one deal pays for VA a part-time VA so I mean if you get one deal a year because of the
[00:42:37] the systems you're having them do you need to look at the systems and say is this gonna give me an ROI
[00:42:42] and then if it's not cut it so yeah it's it's really really smart we were talking about his
[00:42:49] efficiency and and and effectiveness too and you and you're also leveling up your VA's you know
[00:42:56] you're not just they're not just staying at their current skill level you you have an academy where
[00:43:00] they're learning new skills I imagine you're you're pushing them hard with AI right now I would
[00:43:05] imagine that is a big thing because they can do so much more with AI than than we'll be able to
[00:43:11] do because they'll they'll be able to interface with it more often yeah totally and like if you
[00:43:17] look at it I tell everyone to get Chatchee B.T. Pro or whatever maybe complexity whatever
[00:43:22] me use it for a few weeks by yourself then give your VA your login and now they are speaking and
[00:43:29] they sound like your brand all the agents want to say I want to be on brand I want to be on brand
[00:43:33] well now they can speak like you like my my I always say let's go in everything Chatchee B.T.
[00:43:39] now says let's go all the time it's like super positive about going it is me right and now my
[00:43:46] VA is me but in the Philippines so it's kind of crazy it is crazy that's really interesting so
[00:43:52] you've trained Chatchee B.T. on your particular personality and your your mannerisms and your
[00:43:58] your style your aesthetic yeah and the way that you communicate and yeah I I've done the same thing
[00:44:04] I I talked to Chatchee B.T. all day long or neem and not all day long but certainly I love being
[00:44:10] able to talk to it and have conversations and it again it starts to change the way it reflects back
[00:44:17] to me based on you know what it knows about me and then giving them the the the VA the login is
[00:44:24] really smart because then now it is speaking in your voice yes oh wow I never would have thought to
[00:44:30] do that that is because that is you just solved a major problem because we think about this a lot
[00:44:36] we say okay I'm going to hire a virtual assistant but they they live in a different country they don't
[00:44:41] maybe understand my culture or our culture we just have different backgrounds different histories
[00:44:47] and they have different values and and of course they do in different ways of being marketed to even
[00:44:53] you know different fonts appeal to different people in different cultures things like that different
[00:44:57] colors it's all different and we can't expect somebody who lives in a different country to know
[00:45:03] all of the ways in which Americans are are you know what light up Americans but Chatchee B.T. knows
[00:45:10] what lights you up and you know what lights up your your audience and so now it's speaking in that
[00:45:17] language and they don't have to try to figure it out Chatchee B.T. will help them with that with that
[00:45:22] messaging that is really smart yeah I mean it's the biggest thing I've heard from agents is I want to
[00:45:28] be on brand I want to be on brand yeah this is how you be on brand like it knows your voice and some
[00:45:35] teams or some some agents will have multiple agents and I'm like and they're using the same VA I'm
[00:45:40] like give them logins for both so now they have the voice of both of you right so and it that and I
[00:45:45] give them I would even give my agents if they ever needed to do anything for me I would give them my
[00:45:49] log in and they can use it and it speaks like me so so far time well I am excited I'm waiting for
[00:45:56] the just to go off script a moment I'm waiting for the day that AI and I don't know when that's coming
[00:46:03] if it's coming but I hope it is where it thinks of an idea for me on its own and says hey DJ I was
[00:46:11] just thinking about this I got an idea for you wow I'm waiting for that I'm we may we may be
[00:46:17] going to be no it's going to be there I mean look at what happened with with the iPhone today
[00:46:21] the new update yeah it's you can now I could have an air pod in my in my ear and you could be
[00:46:25] speaking Spanish you'll be reading it will be translated into my ear are you kidding me I've just
[00:46:29] ordered the new air pod three they come out well they're not they're not shipped they're not
[00:46:34] shipping yet they're shipping I think middle of next month I think or the end of this month so
[00:46:38] yeah I've ordered it I'm excited to test that out I had a guy at my my place yesterday who was a
[00:46:45] handyman he was plumber fixing something and he was Ukrainian and he really didn't speak English
[00:46:50] and we were speaking through Google translate which was pretty effective but it's you know I have to
[00:46:55] type it out and then I have to play it and then he has to hear it and you were going to be able to
[00:46:59] just you know do it through through through the air pods now yeah yeah it's very very exciting I
[00:47:05] think the future is is really figuring out efficiency and and what's so great about this and I know
[00:47:12] you agree is that it allows the agent it it feels overwhelming at first and it feels like a really
[00:47:17] stressful sort of thing to move things over to somebody else and put a lot of trust in faith
[00:47:23] and yeah maybe initially you're going to work a little harder to train them and get them up to speed
[00:47:29] and yeah there's going to be that discomfort there like there is whenever you try anything new
[00:47:34] and like I'm learning notion right now as a as a tool and it's bending my mind it's really I'm
[00:47:41] having a hard time grasping it but I'm right on the precipice of figuring out why this can
[00:47:46] completely organize my life and probably I should have a VA who's an expert at notion as well help
[00:47:51] me with it and you know it's it's frustrating I'm like I'm I'm almost there but I know once I figure
[00:47:57] it out it's going to allow me to to do what I do best which is not organize my life because I'm not
[00:48:04] good at that and I need help with that so I think it's first like identifying what you're not good at
[00:48:10] but you know needs to get done like I'm not good at you know um calling my clients right that's a
[00:48:15] big one I'm not good at calling my past clients and checking in with them I I don't like doing that
[00:48:21] it's not something I'm good at okay there's a solution for that right we can figure that out
[00:48:26] and maybe you do have to make those calls maybe that is something you have to do but the chat
[00:48:31] CBT along with a virtual assistant can give you 25 reasons to call somebody and yep with with
[00:48:37] items of value right now so I love that that Cura is this company that is really taking virtual
[00:48:43] assistants which let's let's face it virtual assistants can be they can have jobs in all sorts of
[00:48:49] different industries and it's tough on them they it's got to be rough and I love that you're taking
[00:48:54] them and specifically plugging them straight into real estate so that's kind of their main focus
[00:48:59] along to it and real estate as all sorts of spokes as well we've got working and and customer
[00:49:04] service and and just obviously operations and compliance and and all this stuff and you're
[00:49:09] training them you're making sure that that team knows real estate processes and efficiencies
[00:49:15] and optimizations and then I come to you and say great I don't have to train somebody I just want
[00:49:20] to find somebody you know I absolutely have to tweak a little bit I'm sure but somebody who's
[00:49:24] already got experience knows what they're doing and I trust you because you're in this business
[00:49:30] you know what works yeah and I think this is just a really really great great product so for anyone
[00:49:37] out there who is not currently using a VA wants to explore how to 4x their you know their their
[00:49:44] investment which again I don't think that's I don't think that's an outlier I think that's
[00:49:49] pretty reasonable I would say I probably have a similar experience I use a VA's a little bit
[00:49:56] differently than you do but I would say I've probably yeah had a similar ROI and I need to
[00:50:03] figure out how to measure that because I'd like to know exactly but I've been using VA's for
[00:50:07] years they have saved me in so many different ways and you know I think this is such a smart idea
[00:50:13] also we should mention that you know you do work with agents all over the country we are a market
[00:50:19] here that Chicago people don't always stay here in Chicago they go elsewhere a lot of times they go
[00:50:24] to Florida they go to Texas they go well really anywhere that's warmer especially in the winter time
[00:50:29] and when they retire so you obviously want to continue making those relationships stronger with
[00:50:36] or new relationships so we have thousands and thousands of listeners guys so if you like what
[00:50:41] you've been hearing from Jared if you think this is the kind of team I want to partner with and we

And now on to our show. Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage team? Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now. And which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you now. I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration. This is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now onto the show. Hello and welcome to another episode of keeping it real the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris.

Find keeping it real hit that subscribe button and let me know what you think of the AI agent. minute my conversation with Jared Jarvis. ["The Best Piece of Advice"] All right, what's the best piece of advice you've received real estate? Um, the best piece of advice that I've received is stop trying to do everything yourself. So once I started delegating away and really structuring my business with processes and people, my business just grew and stress went down. So that's probably the best word of advice that I've received. Worst piece of advice? Just work harder. So in real estate you can always find more to do, right? And I think we're all very competitive. We talked about this together earlier on the call. And I think systems and people beat hustle a lot, right? So it goes back to the people, delegation, getting the right people in place will really let you scale and you don't have to work hard. You just got to really work smarter. So. Yeah, I think that makes a lot of sense because you're right. We can always be busy and that can feel productive. And then if we were reflect on what we've done over that time period, it's not always productive. And I know I fall into that trap. So I appreciate that advice by guest today. Is Jared Jarvis from Second City Agents with Compass? He is in Chicago. Let me tell you more about Jared. Jared is a licensed real estate agent with Compass Realty who is sold over 200 homes and has been featured on HDTV, barstable sports and also featured in Real Producers magazine. He is also the founder and CEO of Cura, a virtual assistant company that helps real estate agents streamline operations, scale their businesses and focus on serving clients. Before transitioning into real estate, Jared worked with Fortune 500 companies as a channel marketing specialist, collaborating with remodellers, builders and architects, a marketing graduate from Illinois State University. He is known for a strong work ethic, creative strategy and deep commitment to his clients. Born and raised in Chicago, he now lives in Irving Park with his wife Elise, their daughter Sienna, their dog Wyatt and also manages 20 rental units as an active investor. So he's doing a lot. I want you to follow Jared at his Instagram on his Instagram, which is Homes of Chicago. And check out his virtual assistant company. We're going to be talking about that today. That is work with Cura CURA, workwithcura.com. We'll have links to both of those in the show notes. Jared, thanks for the intro DJ. That was great. Appreciate it. It's always fun for me to get to know, especially people here locally in Chicago do as many Chicago interviews anymore. I started only doing Chicago interviews because that was the only people I had the confidence to even ask, would you come on my show? Now I don't get to do as many. So I appreciate that. You and I have those agents and they're all just great agents and excited to have you have you here. So I want to talk a little bit. I love that you have a marketing background. That's my background as well. I want to sort of dive into that first and just kind of understand how you think about marketing because that is something that you probably bring up a particular skill set where a lot of agents struggle on the marketing side. Tell us a little bit about how you market your business. I think that brand is everything right. I think as you stated earlier, it's homes of Chicago. Right when I started from the beginning, I wanted to be the go-to Chicago agent for real estate agents nationwide. I didn't think about actual clients. I thought about how do I get out to a broader section of people. So it was a completely different mindset. So my marketing mindset is completely the opposite of what people are doing. So if you're going A, I'm going B. Right. It's also guerrilla marketing tactics. Right. Like doing different things on social media, like top 30 lists. Like one of our videos got 60,000 views. It was and it usually it's top 10. Right. It's a top 10 list. Yeah. I said let's do a top 10 of Ramanoodle Soup. Soup. Soup. Super random. Have I aided all those places? Maybe. Maybe I haven't. You don't know that. But 60,000 people tuned into that video and were requesting and debating about Ramanoodle Soup. By the way, I'm going to jump in for a second because this is such a brilliant video. I love Raman and there are, there are, you know, maybe a hundred Raman places here and I go or close to it. There probably really is about 100 and I every time I always forget which is the best. I literally just can't remember because I have a terrible memory and I always go onto Google. Well, I guess I would use chat, chbt to help me, but I always go or YouTube and I would say or Reddit and I would say it's the very best Raman right now because new ones pop up all the time. Sure. And it's so funny that you made that video because that is such a brilliant video because I think me would have found that video. I might have found that video and it's just a great idea for marketing because yeah, 60,000 people, I mean, the Raman is such a great example of that. Yeah, exactly. And I don't think it has to be all about like marketing. You really need to know who your target market is, right? And you really need to think outside the box like how can you help people with a problem, right? And for our clients, as you know in real estate, they're looking for you to be the solution for it's not just the real estate transaction, it's everything in life from engagement rings to the best Raman places to, you know, a lot of my followers now are real estate around the country because I'm on one of the top teams in Chicago. I'm using virtual assistance and now they're looking at me for how what is he using a virtual assistant for, right? Like I have been posted on social media this year myself once. It's my VAs, right? I'm behind the scenes creating the content like looking at the content, approving the content and stamping it, but then it goes out and it's out to the world. So it's been pretty cool. Yeah, I love that. I want to dive into this problem solving methodology because this is a marketing sort of paradigm shift that once somebody gets it specifically around solving problems related to what your clients are experiencing and may not be related to real estate, right? Like Raman, it might be dinner, what am I going to have for dinner, or maybe it is real estate related tangentially like where's the best grocery store in this particular neighborhood or how close to my to the subway system here in Chicago we call the L or things like that or where the best places to live for, you know, X, Y or Z. I think those are absolutely how I know that's how I search on Lahen and I'm always looking for answers to those questions. I were going on a trip to the Northeast in next week and I specifically was looking at like where are the best places to visit in May? New Hampshire and Vermont and those are searches I do and those are video searches I do and you're right. 60,000 people will find that and what I love about YouTube in particular that a lot of agents sort of neglect YouTube and they focus more on Instagram and Facebook and TikTok and those are great but those are sort of flash in the pan digestible they go away. They don't, I mean they do technically live forever but they don't, the algorithm doesn't really favor older content but YouTube does favor older content if it's good and that stuff just lives forever and you can continually get leads I'm sure you do. Yeah totally. From those kind of videos so you know when you start to think about problems that your clients have it must be pretty fun to do that because then you just can think about content creation. Well I mean yeah I mean like one of the things I, one of the problems we saw with clients for example was we're moving in a new house we need to turn a new furniture. Yeah and if you've moved before DJ you know it's extremely expensive to buy furniture. How many agents out there have trade discounts or even know what trade discounts are. Like if you have an LLC and you're a real estate agent you can message every major top brand out there and you can get 20 to 40% off discount codes that you can provide your clients and so just having that sheet to send out to your clients when they move or post it on social media if you're like hey like I didn't buy with you I bought with my other this other person like why didn't they give me a trade-dice account can you give me the trade? Absolutely like like I'll give you the tiny one right and it's that going back to help with this and how do you solve that's just an example. That is a great example I've never heard of that so I love that so if you have an LLC or an S corporation you have a company for your real estate practice as Jared says reach out to the furniture manufacturers and see if they're gosh I didn't know DJ you could even reach out to Crater Barrel Crater Barrel has trade discounts right 30% off like container store our house all those websites all those different companies. I'm thinking about so I'm looking to put my place on the market and I have to get it you know just things patched up and and you know scuffs marked out you know that kind of thing and I realized I have this one of my one of my I guess baseboards is got some water in it kind of expanded so I have to replace it and I'm like I don't know who who does that I mean I can find somebody on tasker and I can just look it up but I would much rather go to somebody like you who probably knows who the best handyman are and or you know you would have that resource and like I have it a license I don't really use it but I don't know who to go to so those are things that people are going with it everybody I always think like probably everybody who owns a property could always use a handyman at any given time while they're living there like there's always a project that isn't finished totally something to be fixed up so handyman stuff is super helpful oh yeah I mean you have to have that especially as our careers have progressed we're now getting more into the listings and we have to have a whole team come in and quickly get this house up to what the the quality that we like to list right so I mean we have two pretty much handyman that are working around at Chicago and area and electrician plumber drywall or all that stuff so yeah well let's talk about some trends that you've noticed and you know how are buyers and sellers changing these days I know you've mentioned there's been some shifts and curious to know sort of what you're witnessing well on the buyer side they are definitely hyper focused on the rate I would say because you know this generation saw the rates dropped in the 2s and 3s and they don't really understand the concept of why did that happen why did it go back so quickly and now it's going down and for example like I have clients under contract right now they got a 6.75 interest rate from one mortgage broker and the other one just beat him by a half a point wow okay and they're like why does that happen and I'm like that's a great question right now did that mortgage broker not lock in the rates the rates went up today who knows but I think they're super hyper focused on that I also think that now with Chatchee BT and AI they can really really be just really really know a lot more about the home buying process at at their fingertips like you can take a photo of an AC unit in Chatchee BT post it and say what years this and the serial number instantly tells me how what's the life like expectancy and how long how long has been so I would say that and then on the selling side right it's they are expecting the house to really be marketed in a very I would say visually impactful way right like I had a client the other day was like hey should we virtually stage this like if we take we're going to remove all the all the furniture that's in there because it's a renter and we're going to virtually stage it and I said hey if you're scrolling through 80 80 places today okay and you see a property that's empty okay and then you see a property that has staged furniture virtually staged you may not even know if it's virtually staged because it's so good sure but you can envision your your dining room table being in that kitchen you can imagine your couch being in that living room that gets your minds thinking and slows you down just a little bit from not scrolling every second maybe every three seconds I get attached to that house right so I think sellers are really expecting us to really step our games up from an artificial standpoint also like listing descriptions like you see these listing descriptions that are like 250 400 500 words yeah we're doing a thousand to 2000 wow SEO we're trying to get SEO we're trying to get as many views onto those properties as possible so for listing descriptions are what's your thought process there for longer descriptions is it I want to tell a story is it you know kind of walk me through that a little bit well we gather as much details about the mechanics and any updates they don't we do I mean I take photos of every single major mechanical product that when we go through the walkthrough right so I have that so they don't fill out the whole description of like because they don't know right at the age of the washing machines sure we have all that details we then ask them if there's any favorite restaurants shopping or parks that they like an area things that they like do with their kids or family and then we take all of that data and then we take you know more information about that property as well we put it into chat you be tier an AI it spits out you know we put in the MLS rules because it has the MLS rules I'll say please audit this to the MLS rules and it provides this amazing content sometimes it will put like restaurants in there and you you know I do my due diligence look it up and it's like this is we're not going to market a fast food restaurant that has five stars are like five five star reviews like there's no one going there right but it gives a really good output and then you know you just let the SEO come in which is great so so that's one of the that's how we look at it from a character standpoint I love that you're you are all in an AI I am doing a lot with it myself and I'm I'm learning and we're doing videos just for anyone listening if you're not currently a subscriber to our social channels please do look us up keeping it real where everywhere on all the channels we do short form video there where I do an AI prompt two to three times a week for agents that they can use to help grow their business and one of the things and I know you do this with your AI prompts is really thinking about crafting the query is really the most important way and so I do this with YouTube descriptions I suspect you might do the same where I upload a video I put just you know my version of a description in and then I have YouTube review the video or sorry I have chat GPT review the video and then say acting as an SEO specialist that understands the YouTube algorithm and here's who I'm looking to attract to this video here's what here's what I'm looking to with the YouTube algorithm to do for me please rewrite the description in a you know engaging way and you can really just get hyper specific about it now you know and it always comes up with something better than I could have done so totally no I mean and talking to it like that it takes a moment for people to write like I want this to be elegant yeah uh a thousand characters uh I want you to include restaurants I want you to include local parks uh schools like you have to talk to it in a certain way and then you have to give it more details at the end of massage it so it's not perfect but like it it gets better and better the more you talk to it which at like the pro version at least so well I love that you're using AI you also are really big with virtual assistance I am as well I'm all an un virtual assistance they make my life so much better and I'm so grateful that we live in a world where I can have people that you know from all over the world who are willing to you know work with me they're effective they're efficient they're super knowledgeable and let's talk a little bit about it and you you love it so much you created a whole company specifically for real estate agents called cura to help them streamline so tell us about cura so cura was born out of my need for a virtual assistant um I had a daughter she came home early she was born 10 weeks early right oh wow um it was scary like yeah you know my wife was at home and she's now amazing she's running around but I realized after she was like six months old I'm like I need to delegate things away I can't keep doing be a present father and husband and not be there for my clients right I need to let go so I brought on a virtual assistant in 2023 and you know I had this whole idea of let's email every agent at a certain brokerage okay for the for the next year four times and see what happens so we emailed 90,000 emails that year love the next year we got four deals and I was like holy cow I got a four X R R R Y on this thing so I was at a retreat with a bunch of top agents around the country and they came up to me we're at dinner and they go how are you doing all this fine so quickly and what do you like what's the secret I said the VA and they're like can you help us find one and so I found two agents of VA and then my goal this year was hey let's find one virtual assistant per year or per month to help one agent by Easter we had 20 clients and I was like all right I need help so my cousin was the 25th employee of Uber and he he was retired and he goes he looked at the numbers and he's like this is amazing like tell me about it like what are you passionate about why are you doing this and I told them both version why I'm passionate about helping people in the Philippines why I'm passionate about helping people here yeah and he's like I'm in so then he came in and then the chief of staff for Waymo the self-driving car company whose friends with my cousin heard about it and he's like I'm in so it's us three running around you know three crazy guys running around and now we're up to 33 VA's since pretty much kind of like May we had it you know we had the 20 clients but now we're we triple the size of the business in like three months and now we have this business exploded and that's why I wrote to you I was like I got I got to tell the world about this right we are a real estate specific and what's specific about this I saw all these other VA companies and I said what are they doing wrong and the the biggest thing I said they were offering 40 hours a week most could you repeat that please you cut out just for a second yeah the biggest problem for you hours the biggest problem is agents cannot manage themselves for 40 hours right alone someone else yep right so we flipped the script and said it's kind of like a co-op right 10 hour buckets so we can have one VA working for two or three agents a lot of time and people can pull the resources to use these VA's and these VA's get right I can't afford to pay for someone full time yeah I need 10 hours and no one's gonna work just 10 hours for me so I you have a pool of people that you can plug and play into their schedules and I can get that 10 hours exactly and the other thing to think about is retention so the other VA companies when a VA would lose their when they would lose if they lost their client for example like let's say the clients like hey I can't I can't afford this this quarter they be out of a job and what happens then they have to feed their families yeah so they go to another VA company with us if we lose a client like we had one the other day it was like I just can't manage they're like I just don't know how to manage people I just it's not for me I'm an individual contributor I'm in New York I'm fast paced I can't slow down like that's cool um she that VA has two other clients so they stay with us and they grow and it's seen this amazing growth of building things with real estate agents all over the country at different brokerages and there's a lot of things with tech you know techs the sex equal thing but at the end of the day what we've seen is a lot of these agents they're not using the tech you for sure for sure they're not even using the tech so the VA's come in and they learn about the tech then they start using the tech right and I think that's that's been a really amazing thing to be able to wake up in the morning you know you know we're helping people overseas and also helping people here to to provide a better product to clients that are buying all over the country and I feel like I'm a part of that every day it's pretty cool really exciting tell us what the VA's some of the tasks they can actually do sure I mean I heard a great story today one was a client concierge and an agent of ours and she's a really big agent was married to an NFL player in Houston she has one of our our VA's calling all of her past clients as the the X team so it looks like they're from Houston saying hey we offer a concierge service you need any dinner reservations you need anything let us know I love that amazing the other thing is any listing she has is they're calling real estate agents throughout that neighborhood an area that has I have done a deal in in those areas and saying hey I'm from X Y and Z team we have this listing coming up we just want to let you be the first one to know if you have any buyers or you're looking for anything let us know we can get you in first and she's like and they're giving daily reports to the clients so the clients are like wow like you're everywhere like this is amazing you're cold calling people and then you're giving me daily reports on this like no one else is doing that so there's stuff like that's incredible incredible to hear and she told us that today so that was pretty that was an awesome story I want to go I'm gonna totally break what we were just talking about virtual assistance because I wanted to go back I apologize for the non-continuity here but you it's something very important at the beginning and I just forgot to go back to it so I'm gonna go back to it now and then we're gonna go back in a virtual assistant this is not the way to a structure a well-flowing podcast but I think this is super important you said when at the very beginning when we were talking about your marketing background you would mention that you've sort of flipped the script and you were more interested in building relationships with other agents yes and all over the country which again yes really really smart because and I we sort of kind of went past that I want to just real quickly take a quick detour let's go into that why did you do that I I knew I wanted referrals inbound and I knew long-term I didn't know if it was coaching or something but I knew I loved helping other agents and so right now I'm you can call me a manager whatever may be of of three agents on the second city agents team and a lot of people don't know that so I help you lie with with half the you know a quarter of the team but I loved connecting with other agents around the country almost felt like I was like flying in and like traveling when I would connect with them and the biggest deal I've ever gotten was I was I remember this day I was mowing my grass and my assistant here locally said you just got a message about a referral for 2.1 million dollars come to you and they flew in they bought the house and seven months later they were like hey we were here 20 years ago we were really not vibing with Ravenswood anymore can you sell the property so that they sold the property for I think it was like 250 thousand dollars more and then we bought another house in Winnecco for like two million dollars so it was like six million dollars and less than a year from from Instagram and it was the from the referral program or just like I just in my mind knew I wanted to start having inbound referrals and I knew it was bigger than just Chicago it's everywhere people are coming here we live in the third largest city in the richest country in the world and they're going to continue to move here right so I love that saying shout out Eli Masood for that line I love that line that is such a brilliant idea so really if you don't have an agent network think about adding that to your marketing plan and start thinking about how you can help agents in other parts of the country and where people who live in your your your area where they move to and where people move might move in from that start developing those relationships and building those connections and yeah that's what I figured you were doing and I'm so glad that we took that quick detour let's go back to the virtual assistant play because uh and virtual assistants can help do this as well they can help this is how it started yeah yeah I love this um so talk talk to me more about so I'm an agent and I'm I'm doing so many different hat I'm wearing so many different hats I'm doing so many different tasks and some things I'm good at some things I like to do other things I'm not as skilled at or and some things I just don't like to do as well and but I have to do them right and I trying to figure out what I should do and what I should delegate so maybe we should let's start there so if you were an agent trying to figure this out I know you've already figured this out for you how would you start to think about because I want I want to make the case for is everybody needs a virtual assistant here so let's make the case how do you first figure out that you need one if everyone on this call or on this podcast is listening and has just thinks is there one thing that they could delegate away right now the answer is yes okay so then you've got our group it you've got daily you've got weekly you've got monthly and you've got quarterly tasks right and then you break that down I have this daily task this person's responsible are they trained on that and then you're tracking it okay and then you're analyzing is it working for my business and if you start with one task the first week maybe you start with one daily task and one weekly task then the second week you add another one and another one and after about a month to two months you've got eight daily task going and eight weekly task going and then you start adding in projects it's game over I mean driving back from the office to my home office I literally got on the phone and needed my assistant to create four emails blasts for different listings and upcoming summit I'm going to to speak at like I needed all of this stuff done I don't have the time now I'll have the time to approve it or approve read it but I don't have the time to build it out and she does and she's also doing all my other daily tasks so if that answers your question yes start with one to two things and do you have different VA's who have different skill sets doing different things or are they sort of trained in everything we do I always say that social media VA's can step back to admin stuff and usually admins can't step up to social media so right now we have a director of operations that does is is very proficient in social media and does all of our administration stuff and then we have a social media slash like BD person that creates a calendar and then every at the beginning of every month she sends me like 15 you know literally scripts and like what she wants me to do and she says do this record yourself and then send it to me I'll make it look pretty and I do it in one day and it's done and I tell her to always tell me like a week in advance and then give me a deadline holding accountable to that deadline so I I have a virtualist is funny I have a virtual assistant also from the Philippines and I by the way I so grateful that the Philippines is a nation that exists as the nicest people on the planet who live there and also the hardest working I mean they are just a treasure to to to work with if anyone's ever worked with anyone from the Philippines it is it's it's I've never had a back experience that I've we have a lot of experience with virtual assistants there and you're really helping them tremendously that is that is a country that really benefits from from this exact sort of opportunity and I have one her her name's Janika she is my right hand woman and she helps me in business she also wakes me up every morning at 6 a.m. and she calls me now it's not 6 a.m. her time of course it's like 6 p.m. so it's no big deal for her and she doesn't it's not like I'm this lazy American who's like I have to have somebody wake me up no I set my alarm for 555 so that she doesn't actually have to call me at 6 but just in case I sleep through it and I don't send her that message at 555 then she at 6 a.m. she will you know click on WhatsApp give me a quick call it's time to wake up now in the two years she's been doing this for me she's only ever had to call me once or twice and the rest is like I'm just too embarrassed so I immediately wake up I go Jenna guy I'm up I'm up but this was something I needed because I struggled to get up in the morning and it's you know it's it you can have virtual assistants help with this now takes her all of 15 seconds to just you know call me whatever it's like no big deal to her she's getting paid for it and I have her helping me schedule plan dates with my with my partner with the girlfriend she's saying here's all the cool things going on in Chicago this weekend what do you want to do dinner reservations and things like that too so you know virtual assistants are so helpful because you know I don't want to spend it's not that I don't want to find cool things to do with my girlfriend I do I just don't want to search for all the cool things I want all the cool things to come to me and then I just filter through those top 30 like or in your case the scripts you're getting for your social media content right you want that brought to you and then you can make those decisions much more quickly and then also that accountability piece is so important is having you know give me a due date make sure I'm doing it and we all need accountability too I love this but it really is this thing that if if you're listening and you're like thinking I don't know how to give up that control then work on that because you will benefit so much by not digging your your claws into every part of your business and trying to hold on to everything and do it yourself you're just not going to be able to this is the bottom line and we also know that multitasking it's been well proven it does not work nobody can do it virtually nobody is good at multitasking and real estate agents are all having to multitask all day long because that's just the nature of the job so virtual assistants can help you do that and what I love about cura is that you have specialized people for different tasks because this is a problem for people when they start looking into virtual assistants a lot of times they'll go on upwork they'll submit you know to try to find someone and then they get 100 resumes and they're like gosh I don't know who to choose I don't know you know they can look at reviews and that's good but can this person do everything like you said could they do social media and admin tasks probably not well if they could do admin tasks they probably can't do social media but the reverse maybe works so you really need somebody who's got a team in place specific to real estate stuff and that's what you've built and so we're talking about also what I what I love is I'm assuming your virtual assistants can also do things like you get a client and then they can start to create a calendar you know if you're all the important dates and they can reach out to you and say today's the day you need to call so and so and let them know it's 45 days before closing or whatever exactly they could do all that so did you did you build a lot of those systems and then train the staff on them or are you having where are you picking up some of these systems we're picking up I mean we put a lot of we create systems and videos we record them we then have them go through about a month onboarding process and then they start working with the real estate agents so there's also we launched Cura Academy which is partnered with like another company that essentially they can take continue education for free to level them up so we believe that they should continue to learn and progress through their career either with us or somewhere else I want them to continue to learn and also having like we have monthly jam sessions where we have one of like for example we had his name's A.C. He was working for an agent in Nashville and we heard about this amazing document that he created Excel document where he plugs all the information in from all of like homes.com all the different websites right and then it essentially creates a email he takes that email and the listing age it looks at it and then sends it out for his listing report every week to his sellers so it's just like stuff like that it gets better and better and better over time because we're only working with real estate agents and our VA's are all it's like a roundtable of talking and if like they don't know the answer they'll go to one of the other 32 and if the 32 don't know it and my VA doesn't know it and I don't know it then it probably doesn't exist possibly or we or we do some research on it we figured out. I always think too that CRMs are often neglected and not not so much in the daily activities that people use them and know what they need to do day to day but in updating the data for the client and a virtual assistant is like the perfect person to be able to call every single person in your CRM or past clients and say hey I just want to make sure we have your birthday correct in here I just want to make sure we have XYZ data in here even if you want to know somebody's you know wedding anniversary or whatever information you want maybe their kids ages or birthdays you know you could have that person call on behalf of you and say well you know we're updating your data we want to celebrate your birthday every year we don't have it what is it when is your birthday and that's a touch point DJ yes that's a touch point because they saw that your team reached out and actually cared about them and then they remember you right and that's that's where a lot of agents are missing or missing it you know that too so it's kind of crazy so it's just small little touches like that just takes to the next level yeah let's talk about so if I'm so so I'm an agent I've now thought about some tasks that I do for example I some some agents are really great at every day on Facebook they see the list of happy birthdays or the birthday you know are the you know it's on LinkedIn as well and then they start sending messages to people however they want to do that but that takes takes time it's a fairly repetitive task and something that probably could be automated or at least delegated rather not automated delegated to a virtual assistant so even things like that could be you know super helpful totally I mean transaction coordination chief of staff client concierge lead follow up I mean there's so many things that you can delegate away it's wild like the one where you have your VA calling I'm like holy cow I should probably implement that because I always hits news so at like six a.m you're earlier than me well it's what's funny is yeah that's helpful for me but one thing that's really helpful for my relationship is she she will say okay you have to plan not my my girlfriend but my virtual assistant I've told her make sure I plan at least one date every single week and you know by Wednesday I have to have the date planned because if I don't then you know it's gonna be really hard to get it done in time for the weekend so yeah so we have a we have a process for even things like that because and another thing she's done is even people in my personal life who I want to make sure I stay connected to it and again you can translate this over to business is she makes sure that I'm calling my friends every so often I want to make sure I'm staying in touch with so and so every 90 days you know just to you know for my own personal but again business stuff yeah this is this is all things that virtual assistants can absolutely do and keep you productive so if somebody wanted to explore Kira what's the process how do they get involved so you go to work with Kira.com you'd fill out the form then we have an initial consultation okay and then you would have a interview with the VA's and then from there we would have a weekly call with you every single month after that free of charge and then a monthly call after that as well so that's reoccurring to just to make sure we value the feedback of the agents to hear about like what's going right what's going wrong what are you creating with the VA's and just almost like a mastermind group of content and we're just to pump it out as much as we can if we find something that's valuable we'll send out to all the agents as well so oh that's really cool too yeah some extra like hey so and so in a different total part of the oh I love that it's it's a group thing kind of it's like a group thing yep yep yep yeah mastermind yep it's a mastermind yeah it's for you people are like people are blown away they're like how are you not charging like for at least extra things and I'm like we shouldn't we should make this is but as the best possible version it can be and it as simple as possible right and that's what's special about it so I think that's why it's been growing so fast that's amazing and you can choose the number of hours I'm sure you have packages you have yeah it's all in the west it's all in the website you know exactly what the prices are going to be you know exactly how it works and then one of us will get in contact with with you as well so what if you estimated because you're a data guy what would you estimate your ROI is on a virtual assistant not not as an owner of Kura but just as an agent yourself well for me I mean it was 4x last year I mean I mean I I brought in I think I spent like $10,000 last year and I brought in about 40,000 on and it was specifically though like I could tie it it was emails outbound bulk emails the agents saw them they emailed me back said hey I have a client I saw your email a couple months prior because they don't delete their emails right there in the inbox so they searched they searched Chicago because we send 4 emails a year about cool things about the city we love like the best tropical restaurants stuff that's really out there right marketing right and and then I also bonus my VA as well because you did this work you should be incentivized as well just like me so but then I hear stories like in Houston where she got three listings for like four million dollars from calling just calling past clients just saying hey we're checking in how are you doing oh hey could you come by I want to possibly sell my house I didn't even know that till today she her name's Alicia she told me this I was like wow that's that's incredible so the ROI I mean it's endless on it if you get one deal it pretty much pays for VA right one deal pays for VA a part-time VA so I mean if you get one deal a year because of the the systems you're having them do you need to look at the systems and say is this gonna give me an ROI and then if it's not cut it so yeah it's it's really really smart we were talking about his efficiency and and and effectiveness too and you and you're also leveling up your VA's you know you're not just they're not just staying at their current skill level you you have an academy where they're learning new skills I imagine you're you're pushing them hard with AI right now I would imagine that is a big thing because they can do so much more with AI than than we'll be able to do because they'll they'll be able to interface with it more often yeah totally and like if you look at it I tell everyone to get Chatchee B.T. Pro or whatever maybe complexity whatever me use it for a few weeks by yourself then give your VA your login and now they are speaking and they sound like your brand all the agents want to say I want to be on brand I want to be on brand well now they can speak like you like my my I always say let's go in everything Chatchee B.T. now says let's go all the time it's like super positive about going it is me right and now my VA is me but in the Philippines so it's kind of crazy it is crazy that's really interesting so you've trained Chatchee B.T. on your particular personality and your your mannerisms and your your style your aesthetic yeah and the way that you communicate and yeah I I've done the same thing I I talked to Chatchee B.T. all day long or neem and not all day long but certainly I love being able to talk to it and have conversations and it again it starts to change the way it reflects back to me based on you know what it knows about me and then giving them the the the VA the login is really smart because then now it is speaking in your voice yes oh wow I never would have thought to do that that is because that is you just solved a major problem because we think about this a lot we say okay I'm going to hire a virtual assistant but they they live in a different country they don't maybe understand my culture or our culture we just have different backgrounds different histories and they have different values and and of course they do in different ways of being marketed to even you know different fonts appeal to different people in different cultures things like that different colors it's all different and we can't expect somebody who lives in a different country to know all of the ways in which Americans are are you know what light up Americans but Chatchee B.T. knows what lights you up and you know what lights up your your audience and so now it's speaking in that language and they don't have to try to figure it out Chatchee B.T. will help them with that with that messaging that is really smart yeah I mean it's the biggest thing I've heard from agents is I want to be on brand I want to be on brand yeah this is how you be on brand like it knows your voice and some teams or some some agents will have multiple agents and I'm like and they're using the same VA I'm like give them logins for both so now they have the voice of both of you right so and it that and I give them I would even give my agents if they ever needed to do anything for me I would give them my log in and they can use it and it speaks like me so so far time well I am excited I'm waiting for the just to go off script a moment I'm waiting for the day that AI and I don't know when that's coming if it's coming but I hope it is where it thinks of an idea for me on its own and says hey DJ I was just thinking about this I got an idea for you wow I'm waiting for that I'm we may we may be going to be no it's going to be there I mean look at what happened with with the iPhone today the new update yeah it's you can now I could have an air pod in my in my ear and you could be speaking Spanish you'll be reading it will be translated into my ear are you kidding me I've just ordered the new air pod three they come out well they're not they're not shipped they're not shipping yet they're shipping I think middle of next month I think or the end of this month so yeah I've ordered it I'm excited to test that out I had a guy at my my place yesterday who was a handyman he was plumber fixing something and he was Ukrainian and he really didn't speak English and we were speaking through Google translate which was pretty effective but it's you know I have to type it out and then I have to play it and then he has to hear it and you were going to be able to just you know do it through through through the air pods now yeah yeah it's very very exciting I think the future is is really figuring out efficiency and and what's so great about this and I know you agree is that it allows the agent it it feels overwhelming at first and it feels like a really stressful sort of thing to move things over to somebody else and put a lot of trust in faith and yeah maybe initially you're going to work a little harder to train them and get them up to speed and yeah there's going to be that discomfort there like there is whenever you try anything new and like I'm learning notion right now as a as a tool and it's bending my mind it's really I'm having a hard time grasping it but I'm right on the precipice of figuring out why this can completely organize my life and probably I should have a VA who's an expert at notion as well help me with it and you know it's it's frustrating I'm like I'm I'm almost there but I know once I figure it out it's going to allow me to to do what I do best which is not organize my life because I'm not good at that and I need help with that so I think it's first like identifying what you're not good at but you know needs to get done like I'm not good at you know um calling my clients right that's a big one I'm not good at calling my past clients and checking in with them I I don't like doing that it's not something I'm good at okay there's a solution for that right we can figure that out and maybe you do have to make those calls maybe that is something you have to do but the chat CBT along with a virtual assistant can give you 25 reasons to call somebody and yep with with items of value right now so I love that that Cura is this company that is really taking virtual assistants which let's let's face it virtual assistants can be they can have jobs in all sorts of different industries and it's tough on them they it's got to be rough and I love that you're taking them and specifically plugging them straight into real estate so that's kind of their main focus along to it and real estate as all sorts of spokes as well we've got working and and customer service and and just obviously operations and compliance and and all this stuff and you're training them you're making sure that that team knows real estate processes and efficiencies and optimizations and then I come to you and say great I don't have to train somebody I just want to find somebody you know I absolutely have to tweak a little bit I'm sure but somebody who's already got experience knows what they're doing and I trust you because you're in this business you know what works yeah and I think this is just a really really great great product so for anyone out there who is not currently using a VA wants to explore how to 4x their you know their their investment which again I don't think that's I don't think that's an outlier I think that's pretty reasonable I would say I probably have a similar experience I use a VA's a little bit differently than you do but I would say I've probably yeah had a similar ROI and I need to figure out how to measure that because I'd like to know exactly but I've been using VA's for years they have saved me in so many different ways and you know I think this is such a smart idea also we should mention that you know you do work with agents all over the country we are a market here that Chicago people don't always stay here in Chicago they go elsewhere a lot of times they go to Florida they go to Texas they go well really anywhere that's warmer especially in the winter time and when they retire so you obviously want to continue making those relationships stronger with or new relationships so we have thousands and thousands of listeners guys so if you like what you've been hearing
