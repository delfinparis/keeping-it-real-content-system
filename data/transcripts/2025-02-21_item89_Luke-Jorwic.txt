[00:01:16] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:19] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:23] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:25] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:28] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:30] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:32] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:34] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:38] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:41] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:43] and which agents at your own firm
[00:01:46] are also looking to leave you.
[00:01:48] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:51] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:53] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:56] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:57] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:02:00] for each agent in your market
[00:02:02] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:06] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:07] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:10] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:12] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:14] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:17] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:20] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:22] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:24] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:26] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:29] corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:04:36] Also leave us a review.
[00:04:38] Let us know what you think of the show.
[00:04:40] All right, let's get to it.
[00:04:41] My conversation with Luke Jorwick.
[00:04:56] All right, my guest today is Luke Jorwick,
[00:05:00] with a here in Chicago, with Jameson Sotheby's International.
[00:05:04] Let me tell you about Luke.
[00:05:05] He's a top 1% producer.
[00:05:07] And for over 12 years, Luke has been part of one of the top teams
[00:05:11] in the Chicago land area.
[00:05:13] He grew up in Elmhurst, which is a suburb here in Chicago.
[00:05:16] But real estate was always at the top of Luke's mind,
[00:05:18] and his unique point of view and experience
[00:05:21] has helped him guide his clients when purchasing, selling,
[00:05:24] and investing in real estate since 2012.
[00:05:28] He's the youngest of four children.
[00:05:29] He grew up with dozens of family members in Elmhurst
[00:05:32] and the surrounding areas.
[00:05:33] The experience of having family members from two to 90 years
[00:05:36] old in Elmhurst provides Luke with an unmatched understanding
[00:05:39] of the town.
[00:05:40] And the way of life there.
[00:05:42] Luke is a graduate of York High School
[00:05:43] and Loyola University here in Chicago.
[00:05:45] After college, he lived and invested in properties
[00:05:48] in River North and Lincoln Park.
[00:05:50] More recently, Luke has moved back to Elmhurst
[00:05:52] and renovated a home right near his family's home
[00:05:55] with his Bernadoodle named Lady, which is,
[00:05:59] I might have to see a picture of a Bernadoodle.
[00:06:01] I'm not sure I know Bernadoodle, but that's awesome.
[00:06:05] And doesn't shit.
[00:06:06] His parents lived nearby in the same home
[00:06:08] that they have been in the family,
[00:06:10] has been in the family for over 50 years.
[00:06:13] Helping clients purchase in sell real estate
[00:06:14] is endlessly fulfilling and Luke prides himself
[00:06:17] on his honesty, his work ethic, and innate ability
[00:06:20] to listen deeply and understand each client's unique needs.
[00:06:24] Each real estate transaction, of course, is different
[00:06:26] and has its own challenges and triumphs.
[00:06:29] Luke would love the opportunity to work with you.
[00:06:32] And he's just a heck of a nice guy.
[00:06:33] I want everybody to follow Luke on his Instagram,
[00:06:37] which is Luke, George JORWIC.
[00:06:40] I will have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:06:43] Follow him on Instagram.
[00:06:44] Luke, welcome to the show.
[00:06:46] Thank you.
[00:06:48] I am really excited.
[00:06:50] I have to sort of peel back the curtain.
[00:06:51] I went into a complete panic right before,
[00:06:55] right 158, two minutes before airtime
[00:06:57] because my computer decided to update.
[00:07:00] And I knew it was supposed to update today,
[00:07:02] but I didn't think it would update right
[00:07:04] when I was trying to get Luke on
[00:07:06] and Luke and I were not connected on social media.
[00:07:08] And I couldn't even look up his phone number.
[00:07:10] I'm like, please, I'm here.
[00:07:12] I just waited.
[00:07:13] So Luke is a gracious guy.
[00:07:15] And I am really excited to talk to him.
[00:07:18] And I will calm down from my freak out from earlier.
[00:07:21] And really, I want to learn about Luke.
[00:07:24] So Luke, tell me a little bit about yourself.
[00:07:26] I know you grew up in the suburbs.
[00:07:28] What brought you into real estate?
[00:07:31] I always was obsessed with real estate.
[00:07:33] When I was looking at graduate high school 2009,
[00:07:36] when I graduated, I really wanted to go to the Paul.
[00:07:39] I actually had a real estate mad degree.
[00:07:44] It was 2009.
[00:07:46] My parents were like, maybe you should get a degree
[00:07:50] in something other than real estate.
[00:07:51] Now the market just is tanking.
[00:07:53] Let's do something else.
[00:07:55] Yeah, all we're hearing is terrible things about real estate.
[00:07:57] But much to their just an egg at the beginning and kidding.
[00:08:00] I went a little bit of a different degree,
[00:08:04] but always loved real estate.
[00:08:06] And between my junior senior years,
[00:08:09] I started working for my current team, actually.
[00:08:13] As a name, I just never learned.
[00:08:17] I worked for my junior year and was clear.
[00:08:20] Wow.
[00:08:22] So as a senior, were you selling
[00:08:24] or were you more supporting the team?
[00:08:27] Maybe it's doing both.
[00:08:28] I got my license that during that summer,
[00:08:31] where you had to have a license to do anything meaningful.
[00:08:34] Sure.
[00:08:34] You're like showing, you're really getting
[00:08:35] to show a property, obviously, without a license.
[00:08:40] So I just got that summer.
[00:08:41] So I was working as an assistant,
[00:08:44] Ralthus talent.
[00:08:46] And just never, I remember the only conversation
[00:08:48] you really ever had about it was,
[00:08:50] right, for graduation, they were just like,
[00:08:52] really stick with this, right?
[00:08:54] You see, yeah.
[00:08:54] Here we are.
[00:08:57] That's amazing.
[00:08:59] We have a, it's funny.
[00:09:00] We get a lot of emails and social media messages
[00:09:04] from people that are in their early 20s.
[00:09:07] And I love to talk to people who started
[00:09:09] in their early as 20s, because it seems daunting.
[00:09:14] It seems like that would be a challenge.
[00:09:17] And getting somebody to help you,
[00:09:19] maybe you'll trust you, to of course help them purchase
[00:09:22] or sell, or did you do a lot of rentals back then,
[00:09:25] because I imagine your peer group at 21
[00:09:27] was mostly renting or how did you get those?
[00:09:29] You did a lot of rentals.
[00:09:31] But I just started.
[00:09:32] I just, even with my team, there was really no formal process.
[00:09:36] We just, I just got thrown in.
[00:09:38] I figured it out.
[00:09:39] I mean, my first appointment was a final walk through.
[00:09:42] Not even know what that meant.
[00:09:43] No threat for closing the new chair.
[00:09:45] It's okay.
[00:09:46] The unit is not high rise.
[00:09:48] It's a pinnacle.
[00:09:49] They were just like, yeah, just go to nine o'clock.
[00:09:52] The door will be the key.
[00:09:54] It'll be fine.
[00:09:55] And I figured it out.
[00:09:56] There was some issue with like,
[00:09:57] the team year move.
[00:09:58] They're no work out.
[00:09:59] He was trying to call someone to pick up.
[00:10:03] So yeah, I was just trial by fire.
[00:10:05] And luckily, we knew lots of people.
[00:10:07] I did lots of rentals in the beginning,
[00:10:09] but you just stuck with it.
[00:10:12] And how many years later is that?
[00:10:14] For 13 and a half, most four years.
[00:10:17] Yeah.
[00:10:17] Yeah, still doing it.
[00:10:19] It's really fun.
[00:10:20] I think it's crazy that real estate not crazy,
[00:10:22] but it's always interesting to do that real estate is such a,
[00:10:24] is a very common second job, like a career change job,
[00:10:28] because the thought of having a salary,
[00:10:31] kind of, I joke all the time, that sounds great.
[00:10:35] But I never knew that.
[00:10:36] So this just weird crazy way of making a living
[00:10:39] is the only thing I know.
[00:10:40] The idea of like having a 401k of the map
[00:10:43] from the quitting to the Celerial State Sons and Sons and Sons.
[00:10:45] That must be nice.
[00:10:46] 
[00:10:47] Like you got to just stay.
[00:10:48] Health insurance?
[00:10:49] What?
[00:10:50] That would be great.
[00:10:51] There's a figure of health insurance.
[00:10:52] You're not going to do it, at least.
[00:10:54] I pay myself.
[00:10:56] I pay myself.
[00:10:57] I've been asked corporations.
[00:10:58] So even though I'm technically an employee of my own company,
[00:11:01] I don't have very health insurance.
[00:11:03] Either I have, you know, traditional individual insurance.
[00:11:06] And I was at the dentist yesterday.
[00:11:07] And, you know, it's just, it's so painful to pay.
[00:11:11] So I'm like, I can't wait to get married
[00:11:14] and hopefully get on someone else's group plan.
[00:11:17] But I wanted to touch on something that you mentioned
[00:11:19] about part time.
[00:11:21] Because most agents or most people that have a license
[00:11:24] are part time, which is really interesting.
[00:11:27] And they have other jobs in a lot of cases.
[00:11:30] And I talk to agents who are full time, of course,
[00:11:32] on the show, everyone's full time, just like you.
[00:11:35] You work so much and you work so hard
[00:11:38] and well into the evenings because it is, of course,
[00:11:41] your business.
[00:11:42] And I can't imagine doing both.
[00:11:45] I mean, to me, it would, of course,
[00:11:47] be nice with the benefits.
[00:11:48] But I don't know how, even just doing one deal
[00:11:51] on top of your regular job seems like a very daunting task.
[00:11:56] Yeah, I don't understand how people could do that.
[00:11:58] I mean, more hard to them.
[00:11:59] But just even the mental load of just having one deal going on,
[00:12:04] I can't imagine thinking of any females.
[00:12:06] But people do it.
[00:12:07] I don't understand why you'd want to work
[00:12:09] with somebody as a part time broker.
[00:12:11] I'm sure they're great part time brokers.
[00:12:13] But for myself, I couldn't imagine doing this
[00:12:16] doing something else.
[00:12:17] It is a tricky schedule just having this job.
[00:12:22] So I can't imagine doing it while doing it.
[00:12:26] So it's 2025.
[00:12:28] And I want to talk a little bit about challenges.
[00:12:31] I really talk about this.
[00:12:32] And I think it's really interesting to our audience
[00:12:35] because everyone struggles, everyone's business is imperfect.
[00:12:38] Everyone's got something that they want to work on
[00:12:41] or they know they should work on just out of curiosity
[00:12:43] because you are a incredibly successful agent.
[00:12:46] You do very, very well.
[00:12:48] And people certainly aspire to that,
[00:12:51] but they don't relate to it as much.
[00:12:53] So let's humanize you a little bit.
[00:12:55] And let's talk about what currently,
[00:12:58] we have challenges in the market right now.
[00:13:00] We have low inventory.
[00:13:01] We have rates where we would prefer them not to be.
[00:13:05] So for you personally, where are you finding like,
[00:13:08] I need to work on this part of my business.
[00:13:12] Oh, so many different things.
[00:13:14] I'm the worst at marketing myself.
[00:13:16] It's going to funny.
[00:13:17] I'm on a podcast right now.
[00:13:19] But I hate asking for testimonials.
[00:13:22] I don't get embarrassed like sending postcards with my sales.
[00:13:26] I just dislike it.
[00:13:27] It's so funny.
[00:13:28] And it's not funny.
[00:13:30] So it's just what you need to do.
[00:13:32] No one, you know, the clothes not doesn't get fed,
[00:13:33] but I hate it.
[00:13:35] And I just, I can't, I can't do it.
[00:13:38] When I used to, in the different buildings, I'd live in everyone.
[00:13:41] It's like the first thing you do, oh, you come a building expert.
[00:13:44] You say I live here and I sold this unit and it's the new boss.
[00:13:46] You know, it's very tricky, but you know, it works for your first one.
[00:13:50] And I've never, I've never sold a centipede scarter
[00:13:53] in the nature of building I've lived in until after I moved out.
[00:13:59] I don't know.
[00:14:00] I wish I, it's just, I think it's those things you're,
[00:14:03] you have to work, I have to work on it.
[00:14:04] I've gotten better at it.
[00:14:05] But I just, you're the person who loves doing that.
[00:14:08] It's okay.
[00:14:08] But I just, thanks for skinning, we're all.
[00:14:11] I'll tell you, I have the same exact feeling.
[00:14:14] I don't practice real estate myself, but those same sorts of things
[00:14:17] asking for testimonials, asking for business even.
[00:14:21] It is something that you look, you are proof that you don't have to do
[00:14:26] those things necessarily or you don't have to be loving doing them
[00:14:29] because you are incredibly successful, even though you might not be asking.
[00:14:33] I need a review.
[00:14:34] I need a testimonial.
[00:14:36] Hey, do you know anyone else who might need my services?
[00:14:39] It's amazing because a lot of times our audience
[00:14:43] and really anyone who's not at the top of the mountain yet
[00:14:47] thinks, well, everyone does everything.
[00:14:49] They just do it all.
[00:14:50] They do it effortlessly.
[00:14:52] You know, they work hard, but it's not really that hard for them.
[00:14:54] They just put in the hours.
[00:14:56] And I'm with you.
[00:14:57] I, to ask for business, to ask for something from somebody.
[00:15:01] I find that to be very just not easy for me to do as well.
[00:15:06] You know, I recruit REALTORS.
[00:15:07] I've never once asked a REALTOR, so are you ready to join us?
[00:15:10] Like, I've just, I guess I'm afraid of the no or something,
[00:15:13] but I just don't want to ask that.
[00:15:15] So I think that's incredibly relatable.
[00:15:18] And hopefully our audience listening thinking,
[00:15:20] well, gosh, I'm not good at that either.
[00:15:22] It's okay.
[00:15:23] You don't have to be.
[00:15:25] You can always aspire to be, but you don't have to be.
[00:15:27] And that's the coolest part about this podcast,
[00:15:30] or not about the podcast, but about doing this podcast,
[00:15:33] because people do it in all sorts of different ways.
[00:15:35] So I appreciate your honesty there.
[00:15:37] And you can very, very relatable thing.
[00:15:39] I think, you know, even asking friends for business,
[00:15:42] I, I, I, I, I, that would be a tough one.
[00:15:45] Yeah.
[00:15:45] So like, you don't have to, like, I'll be like, you know,
[00:15:48] I'm like, just for the record, even if I am trying to get the business.
[00:15:51] And I mean, like, you know, it's not, it's not,
[00:15:53] I'm not trying to get the, and I get it.
[00:15:54] You're living in a broker.
[00:15:55] I know great brokers.
[00:15:56] I'm just like, no, just asked to say,
[00:15:58] I've gotten better at that individually.
[00:16:00] With one to one, one to one, I wonder with people I know.
[00:16:03] Especially over time, it's like, yeah,
[00:16:05] because I know what to do.
[00:16:06] It's a user like, tell yourself, I actually,
[00:16:08] I'm the first person to this job.
[00:16:10] But I also will never like, you know,
[00:16:11] areas I don't know, or types of properties.
[00:16:14] I don't know, which I can't do.
[00:16:16] I think I'm from one, but I'm not going to be like,
[00:16:18] oh, you know, feel like you're in Libertyville.
[00:16:20] Sure, I'll do it.
[00:16:21] I've never been to Libertyville.
[00:16:22] So I'm not going to tell you I can do that.
[00:16:25] Like I'm not.
[00:16:26] So it's because a lot of brokers do.
[00:16:28] They're like, sure, I'll do it anywhere.
[00:16:30] And more power to them, I'm sure they're great.
[00:16:32] But I know especially on the neighborhoods
[00:16:34] in Chicago, I know very well.
[00:16:35] And in Elmer's specifically too, it's like,
[00:16:39] you laugh when something that you know,
[00:16:41] this is the market for six months sells.
[00:16:43] And you laugh and you see it sold.
[00:16:45] So some broker from out of town,
[00:16:46] you're like, oh, yeah, that's why they paid that price.
[00:16:49] Because they've never been here before.
[00:16:51] They don't know that like, it was on the market for eight months
[00:16:53] because you know, it shouldn't be that price.
[00:16:57] Right.
[00:16:58] No, it's it's a I really appreciate that.
[00:17:01] And I think to there's something to there's something
[00:17:04] very powerful about saying, I don't do that.
[00:17:07] Or I'm not the right person for that.
[00:17:10] To me, when I hear you say that, I hear honesty,
[00:17:13] I hear authenticity.
[00:17:15] And I hear courage, right?
[00:17:16] The courage to say, I'm not the right person.
[00:17:19] And I like you enough as a possible client
[00:17:23] to give you to somebody else.
[00:17:26] And maybe you refer it out or you have a partner somewhere,
[00:17:29] you know, if somebody says, I want to sell a factory.
[00:17:31] And you're like, I don't really know how to do that.
[00:17:34] Maybe you do, but a lot of agents don't.
[00:17:36] But there are people that do.
[00:17:37] And that's all they do is sell factories.
[00:17:39] And as hard as it is to give away, maybe that business,
[00:17:42] it really, I think ultimately comes back.
[00:17:45] I always love like I always love when I go into a store.
[00:17:49] And person talks me out of buying something,
[00:17:51] which isn't that common.
[00:17:53] But what I do, and they go, you know what,
[00:17:54] you don't want to buy that.
[00:17:55] Don't get that like either wait until it goes on sale,
[00:17:58] or it's not for you.
[00:17:59] Or I love when people say that like,
[00:18:02] I love when I find it's not to buy this.
[00:18:04] It saves us all time.
[00:18:06] It's especially in this tight inventory market, it's hard
[00:18:09] because it has been this way for years.
[00:18:12] It's like every year it's like,
[00:18:14] all inventory sites, it's been tight since like 2015.
[00:18:16] This is not new news.
[00:18:18] It's gotten worse, but it's always been,
[00:18:21] like people just want to show their clients places.
[00:18:23] And I always say it's like the first few times you go out,
[00:18:26] especially when you're working with a buyer,
[00:18:27] it's like, I'll show you anything,
[00:18:28] because you need to go on the market and when something hits,
[00:18:30] you need to be able to make that decision.
[00:18:32] But after a while, people especially in this market
[00:18:35] get a little more desperate and I'm like,
[00:18:36] wow, I might buy this.
[00:18:38] And she's like, no, don't,
[00:18:41] because I'm not going to do buy it.
[00:18:43] Because I have to then hopefully sell it one day
[00:18:45] if what you call me.
[00:18:47] And there's three, you know, there's different reasons
[00:18:48] you should have places that don't work
[00:18:50] for different people for different reasons.
[00:18:52] So I know you just said you want a place of two garage spots
[00:18:56] in an elevator and this is a walk up loft on the third floor.
[00:19:00] You're not going to be happy here.
[00:19:03] Since the first time.
[00:19:04] And you also too, you are super,
[00:19:08] aware that if you were to recommend something
[00:19:11] that you didn't feel was in their best interest,
[00:19:14] that's a violation of your own ethics.
[00:19:16] Forget about the National Association of REALTORS Code of Ethics,
[00:19:19] which it is do.
[00:19:20] But it's actually something that you,
[00:19:22] I can tell you're a very authentic person.
[00:19:24] So I want to talk a little bit about your why.
[00:19:27] So tell us about what it means to you to get to work with buyers and sellers.
[00:19:33] I always, I'm very fascinated with how people live in their homes.
[00:19:37] I'm a huge homebody, which is hard with this job,
[00:19:40] because you have to leave and I love the pandemic and I can't deny.
[00:19:44] But growing up, like my, the house that grew up in was always,
[00:19:47] my parents are both the oldest, their family.
[00:19:49] And we're most of the oldest of our cousins on my one side of the family.
[00:19:54] So everything was just at our house.
[00:19:56] And my parents also bought that house to live in from my grandparents.
[00:19:58] Oh, wow.
[00:19:59] So who are still alive when they bought it?
[00:20:01] Like 25 years ago.
[00:20:02] So everything's naturally all the events there at our house.
[00:20:04] It just happens.
[00:20:05] And I have a little brother who's two years older than he was autism.
[00:20:08] So it's always easier to have stuff at our house.
[00:20:10] Everything's been at our house.
[00:20:11] So it's like my whole life is just entertaining,
[00:20:14] having people over.
[00:20:15] And I really get a kick out of figuring out how people live currently
[00:20:19] and their goals and how they want to live in the future.
[00:20:22] And I can tell, and
[00:20:24] because I've known this for so long,
[00:20:26] I can just picture where someone's going to live,
[00:20:29] a lot of times before they can.
[00:20:31] Just from getting to know them,
[00:20:33] saying, you know, it's just to know a question to ask,
[00:20:35] to get to know a client.
[00:20:37] And that's what I love.
[00:20:38] Like I love like a year later,
[00:20:40] getting a text from a client sitting in their sunroom.
[00:20:42] And being like, I never even knew I wanted a sunroom.
[00:20:45] You know, thank you so much.
[00:20:46] Just ran them stuff like that.
[00:20:49] Is why I do this and what gets you through
[00:20:52] the downs of the ups and downs of a life in real estate.
[00:20:55] There are plenty of them.
[00:20:57] Is that and then just the relationships in my clients.
[00:20:59] It's just very fun and makes each day different, which I love.
[00:21:04] I just like to ask this of my guests that after a sale,
[00:21:08] you know, the stats, the data says they probably aren't moving for seven to ten years
[00:21:14] or whatever the current number is.
[00:21:17] What are you doing in between?
[00:21:19] So you've sold them the home or they've, you know,
[00:21:22] either purchased or sold a home.
[00:21:24] What are you doing to stay top of or back of mind or top of mind?
[00:21:27] How are you staying in touch?
[00:21:30] I love and it's different because it's, you know,
[00:21:33] it's so easy to be in touch.
[00:21:35] You know, these days, you know,
[00:21:36] we've got texts, you've got social media, you've got every weird little tick-tock,
[00:21:39] you know, I don't do a tick-tock, but I should.
[00:21:42] I was really excited when I was getting potentially going to shut down.
[00:21:45] I would still do it.
[00:21:45] So I don't want to get started there, but I should.
[00:21:48] But anything you can be doing, there's so many ways.
[00:21:51] And it's just, a lot of times it's just intuitive.
[00:21:54] Like you'll be driving past a house that makes you think,
[00:21:56] it just makes you think of a client or their house or a comp.
[00:22:00] And it's just making the time to do it right away and you think about it.
[00:22:03] Or at least make a note.
[00:22:05] Reject these people because even if it's people you weren't as serally
[00:22:09] and kind of being close to, you know,
[00:22:11] you know, you know, I'm kind of trying to follow your lines.
[00:22:13] It's just important to stay in touch not only to be kind of in mind,
[00:22:17] but to help them with stuff.
[00:22:19] Like you want to be that person who they go to and they're like,
[00:22:21] oh, I have this lead.
[00:22:23] Do you have someone?
[00:22:24] You know, just like don't.
[00:22:26] I'll find someone, you know, I don't know if you can call you.
[00:22:29] But it's funny because one of our managing broker,
[00:22:31] if Jameson calls it one night standing, your clients,
[00:22:37] if you just if you sell it and call it eventually.
[00:22:41] 
[00:22:42] 
[00:22:42] So which is a good way to think of it.
[00:22:44] It is a really good way to think of it.
[00:22:46] You're right.
[00:22:47] In the first couple of times, you have to be intentional about it.
[00:22:50] Like I was 60 days out, check in, you know,
[00:22:52] remember, but what, you know,
[00:22:53] they're by anniversary of them buying, you check in,
[00:22:56] stuff like that.
[00:22:57] So those those things you have to do.
[00:22:58] And that is the effort of it.
[00:23:00] But the rest of it is I'd rather contact them last.
[00:23:04] I don't have a content calendar, which again,
[00:23:06] I'm sure everyone said you should.
[00:23:08] I don't have one of those.
[00:23:09] I don't like send out emails to my entire client list all the time.
[00:23:14] But as long as those the first few times,
[00:23:16] I've set them up and I can do contact everyone on their
[00:23:19] anniversaries of their sales, etc.
[00:23:21] But then after that, it's all just
[00:23:24] reality of when I think of them.
[00:23:26] It's not can try, which I think makes it more valuable.
[00:23:28] Like I'd rather have two or three,
[00:23:31] you know, I was doing a Christmas card, obviously,
[00:23:33] do a holiday party and you might buy your anniversary.
[00:23:36] So everyone's here for me four times a year
[00:23:37] on things that are just standard that they're going to hear.
[00:23:41] And then every other time I've been challenged them,
[00:23:44] it's legitimately just what I thought of them.
[00:23:47] Which I view is better than I'd rather have five touches a year
[00:23:51] than 12 if they're all fake, not fake,
[00:23:54] but can try their thought of ahead of time.
[00:23:56] I agree. I wrote an article once for a real estate magazine called
[00:24:01] Nobody Wants to Read Your Newsletter.
[00:24:04] And it's, you know, look, I guess a newsletter is better if you're doing nothing
[00:24:08] than it's better than nothing.
[00:24:10] But a reach out, a phone call, I was just thinking about you,
[00:24:14] are we thinking about your property or just, you know,
[00:24:17] came into my mind, that's going to trump the best newsletter that's out there.
[00:24:21] You're absolutely right.
[00:24:22] And I do like, there's a couple of brokers who do newsletters that I really like.
[00:24:26] Because they're there actually about what things they like.
[00:24:29] 
[00:24:29] And like Jeff, you know, Jeff Lentron, you know, Jeff Wilson,
[00:24:32] out of DC, his newsletter is great.
[00:24:36] I'm going to be my personal email and my working,
[00:24:38] and I love each one of them.
[00:24:39] I'll tell you to Nicole Hajdu here in Chicago.
[00:24:42] She does top things to do in the city.
[00:24:45] She sends it out on Wednesday.
[00:24:46] She says top things to do in the suburbs.
[00:24:48] And every Wednesday, it's so brilliant because she's been on the show as well.
[00:24:51] Because everybody here, at least, you know, who lives in some sort of area
[00:24:56] where there's things going on, we're always like,
[00:24:58] what are we going to do this weekend around Wednesday?
[00:25:00] We start thinking about it.
[00:25:01] And I always go to Nicole's email and I'm like, thank you.
[00:25:05] And if for some reason she weren't to send it out,
[00:25:09] I would actually be disappointed.
[00:25:10] So you're right.
[00:25:11] If you're going to do a newsletter, make it something that you're passionate about
[00:25:15] and that your clients actually want.
[00:25:17] You know, I always think like, you're client, you know,
[00:25:20] clients want to know things like what's their home worth and there could be a way,
[00:25:23] I guess you can't really scale that.
[00:25:25] But you know, that's always something that's a conversation piece that could be done,
[00:25:30] text email, I guess a newsletter of sorts.
[00:25:33] But I want to talk about, I want to also talk about millennials because you are a millennial as well.
[00:25:39] I did the math right in the middle.
[00:25:41] Right in the middle.
[00:25:42] And what's really interesting is millennials in particular are buying homes later.
[00:25:49] So this just happened last year, I believe, the age of a first time home buyer went from,
[00:25:57] I think it was 35 up to now 38 years old.
[00:26:01] And what's interesting about that, and this isn't my data.
[00:26:04] I heard Dr. Yoon from the National Association of REALTORS talk about this.
[00:26:08] He was saying there's actually a problem with this.
[00:26:10] And the problem isn't that real estate agents have to wait a little longer for their clients to buy.
[00:26:14] It's that the generational wealth,
[00:26:16] or even just the wealth within one generation, is now they're missing out on,
[00:26:22] I know about 10 years of growth.
[00:26:24] We know that homes typically raise in value over time, over long swaths of time.
[00:26:30] So he actually mentioned like this is a problem.
[00:26:33] So I'm curious about, how are you seeing millennials treat the housing market?
[00:26:40] Are you seeing more rentals?
[00:26:41] Are you trying to educate them?
[00:26:44] Or are you just sort of accepting that that's where they're at?
[00:26:47] So I'm curious to get your take.
[00:26:49] I've seen it a lot of different ways.
[00:26:51] It's a lot, it's obviously the societal issue,
[00:26:54] the one you'll camp at houses of student debt and raising costs,
[00:26:58] and our interest rates in the last few years are very serious.
[00:27:01] And people I have seen wait longer for sure.
[00:27:07] But I have sort of bucked the trend, and I tell people not to.
[00:27:10] I bought my first house in S23.
[00:27:13] But I was in a house as a stretch.
[00:27:16] It was a studio, I put 10% down.
[00:27:19] And I'm in now in my sixth property.
[00:27:23] So I just jumped in and started doing it.
[00:27:25] And it talked to all my friends about it through the process.
[00:27:29] And it's actually something I always say people,
[00:27:33] since people are waiting, they'd be a little more awake longer.
[00:27:35] And they wanted to, I'm going to buy a house, I'm already 32.
[00:27:39] I want to buy housing being a long time.
[00:27:42] I'm always of the mind, buy a house, it's a good investment,
[00:27:45] and you're fine, no matter how long you live there.
[00:27:48] Luckily obviously the market's been great for the last 12 years, 13 years.
[00:27:53] But either way, if you buy something that's good value,
[00:27:55] the check's all the boxes, and you don't put yourself in a position to have to sell,
[00:27:59] you're not going to lose money.
[00:28:01] So that is such a, I want to just pause for more.
[00:28:04] That is such a really intelligent and thoughtful way to look at it.
[00:28:09] Because people want to purchase based on what they want,
[00:28:14] and what they think will give them the, for the most part, not everyone.
[00:28:18] But the vast majority of first-time home buyers in particular,
[00:28:20] want to buy something that they're really excited about
[00:28:23] because of the way that it's structured or what the amenities it has.
[00:28:28] And I like the fact that you might say to them,
[00:28:30] hey, this does have all of that.
[00:28:33] And there may be some challenges with home valuation with this particular property.
[00:28:37] I like that that you bring that in.
[00:28:40] That is an incredibly interesting thing.
[00:28:43] Because you say, I don't know when you're going to move out.
[00:28:45] You might have to move out in two years.
[00:28:47] Life gets in the way.
[00:28:48] Life changes.
[00:28:49] You might, and I don't want this to be something that you regret simply because
[00:28:53] the market timing might not be great.
[00:28:55] So you are the first person I have ever heard say that.
[00:28:59] And I really, really admire that.
[00:29:01] So tell me a little bit more about that.
[00:29:03] How you sort of make those determinations.
[00:29:05] I mean, it's each client's different.
[00:29:08] I'm happy to help people.
[00:29:09] I'm the least pushy person in the world.
[00:29:13] I will never be like, you should buy, read this article,
[00:29:18] generation of wealth.
[00:29:19] I mean, I love real estate brokers.
[00:29:21] But the line of create generation of wealth through real estate.
[00:29:24] It's like, we're not economists.
[00:29:26] We're not your financial advisor.
[00:29:29] Right.
[00:29:29] Like, just, I mean,
[00:29:30] brokers need to chill out a little bit.
[00:29:33] And it's just about talking to that client, helping them through what's right for them.
[00:29:37] And then having their back,
[00:29:38] because at the end of the day, that's really what I think our job is.
[00:29:42] Is knowing that if in two years,
[00:29:45] this person loses their job or their spouse gets a job across the country,
[00:29:49] they're in a position to get out or rent.
[00:29:53] And it's an ill-dick with assets.
[00:29:56] So you have to take so much more consideration when purchasing it.
[00:30:00] Or rent in a place.
[00:30:03] If there's so many variables that I think it's our job to think about,
[00:30:07] I always find it's that
[00:30:08] leaves the stressing up to me and you just find a house you like.
[00:30:12] And I'll make sure everything else is taken care of.
[00:30:15] Not going to sell you in a building that's financially bad.
[00:30:18] Not a rent you in a building that I've heard is crap, because we all know
[00:30:22] those buildings.
[00:30:24] It's stuff like that.
[00:30:25] It's just, I want to make sure my clients are happy
[00:30:28] so that they keep sending me more clients.
[00:30:30] It's like, I don't even think about,
[00:30:33] I don't even keep a track of what deals I have pending that really should.
[00:30:39] Or financially, like a lot of broker are like,
[00:30:41] oh, what money do I have coming in?
[00:30:42] I don't even look at that.
[00:30:44] Because I know the more time I've sent on that,
[00:30:47] the less I'm sending to you on my clients.
[00:30:50] So if you just focus on your clients and having their back,
[00:30:52] it's all that matters.
[00:30:54] And that's all they'll remember.
[00:30:55] And there may be times where you tell people you should rent right now,
[00:30:59] because for the X, Y and Z reason, and I love that.
[00:31:05] My boss told me to do that.
[00:31:06] I own a place now, but years ago, I was thinking about buying
[00:31:10] and I wasn't sure when to get into the market.
[00:31:12] And I just wasn't sure.
[00:31:14] I owned before, but I was renting at the time.
[00:31:16] And I go, really, I don't feel good renting.
[00:31:18] I should buy it.
[00:31:19] He goes, keep renting rent for another year.
[00:31:21] He's like, you get better stuff.
[00:31:23] You get what you want.
[00:31:24] And it's not the right time.
[00:31:26] And I was like, okay.
[00:31:27] And I was so grateful that he did that.
[00:31:30] Because I would have found a place.
[00:31:31] And I would have bought something.
[00:31:33] And maybe it would have worked out.
[00:31:34] Maybe it wouldn't have.
[00:31:35] But I love that when people, like you said,
[00:31:37] when people really have your back,
[00:31:39] that's really all we want in a service professional.
[00:31:42] We all have access to Zillow.
[00:31:44] The public has access to Zillow.
[00:31:46] They can find properties all day long.
[00:31:47] They don't really need us for that.
[00:31:49] They need us to see all the things they can't see.
[00:31:52] And that's what you're doing.
[00:31:53] And I, Guy, very, very much appreciate that.
[00:31:58] And you're also, but you're also an investor.
[00:32:00] So you are a guy that likes buying properties.
[00:32:03] I love buying real estate.
[00:32:04] My favorite thing to do.
[00:32:05] I've run it on crazy.
[00:32:06] I'm always like, why don't I go to move next?
[00:32:08] I've ever been to some crazy.
[00:32:10] Like even right now, I live in a house.
[00:32:12] It's two blocks from my one sister.
[00:32:14] And this is Zillow and some other block this way.
[00:32:15] And my parents live four blocks this way.
[00:32:17] So I happen to have a move.
[00:32:19] Oh, and I like a great rate, of course.
[00:32:22] But I'm always literally in like, oh, should I have some market?
[00:32:25] Like I'm smart too.
[00:32:26] Oh, nice to meet you.
[00:32:26] I always, and crazy.
[00:32:29] And I love that rush event.
[00:32:31] It's nothing better.
[00:32:34] I literally was seeing this week about selling.
[00:32:37] And I probably will.
[00:32:38] But that's all I'm sorry.
[00:32:39] You know, we're hearing, I hear the passion.
[00:32:42] And I think that's so important.
[00:32:45] It really probably drives you when times are difficult.
[00:32:48] And when the market's not cooperating
[00:32:50] and other agents maybe aren't cooperating
[00:32:52] or you're losing deals because of whatever reason.
[00:32:55] And the idea of like that itch of wanting to do it for yourself,
[00:33:00] wanting to do it for your clients,
[00:33:01] and just sort of do the right thing.
[00:33:04] So everybody wins is really powerful.
[00:33:07] It's very infectious.
[00:33:08] It comes across really authentically
[00:33:10] in how you present.
[00:33:12] And I think that is, you know, a real...
[00:33:15] People want to be around people.
[00:33:17] They feel are really into things.
[00:33:18] The whatever that it is they're doing.
[00:33:20] Like I want my accountant to be into accounting.
[00:33:22] Like I want her to just be like,
[00:33:25] oh my god, I just read this cool thing.
[00:33:27] I want to try it with your business or whatever.
[00:33:29] I love stuff like that.
[00:33:31] And I want my dentist to be really into dentistry.
[00:33:33] You know, it sounds silly.
[00:33:35] But a lot of people just work a job.
[00:33:37] And they're happy with it.
[00:33:38] It's okay.
[00:33:39] But they're not really into it in the way
[00:33:41] that I would want them to be.
[00:33:43] Right?
[00:33:43] And so I search those people out.
[00:33:46] And you certainly seem to be of that ilk.
[00:33:50] And I think that's very, very attractive to clients.
[00:33:54] And it probably means you don't have to do some
[00:33:56] of the traditional marketing that other agents do.
[00:34:00] Because that's not really your thing.
[00:34:03] Your thing is this authentic.
[00:34:05] I'm on your side.
[00:34:06] I should do more though.
[00:34:06] I'm sent to be like, I know I need to do more.
[00:34:09] Well, everybody needs to do more everything.
[00:34:12] We all need to eat better.
[00:34:14] We need to work out.
[00:34:15] We need to take better.
[00:34:17] We need to call our mothers.
[00:34:18] But more, there's always things to do.
[00:34:20] And I agree.
[00:34:21] Yeah, we always strive for more and better.
[00:34:23] And at the same time, we want to make sure we do that
[00:34:27] authentically.
[00:34:27] And I think you are demonstrating that.
[00:34:30] I'm really, really impressed with it.
[00:34:32] Comes through very, very effortlessly.
[00:34:35] Because you're clearly into it.
[00:34:37] And I love that.
[00:34:38] And I always tell people who are struggling in this business.
[00:34:41] Maybe you're just not into it enough.
[00:34:43] Like get into it.
[00:34:44] You know, yes, cold calls.
[00:34:47] If you do those, they're going to always suck.
[00:34:48] Like all of that stuff always sucks.
[00:34:51] But so do pushups and so do lots of things in life.
[00:34:54] Lots of things in life that are good for us suck.
[00:34:56] But you can still get into learning.
[00:34:58] I think learning is where it is.
[00:35:00] Is what's, you know, I find to be like when people really want to learn,
[00:35:05] even throughout their entire career, you know,
[00:35:07] I love when my dermatologist is like, I just was that,
[00:35:09] but dermatologist.
[00:35:10] And they're like, oh, I just read this article.
[00:35:11] I want to talk to you about it.
[00:35:12] I was like, I'm so glad you're still reading.
[00:35:15] Like I love that.
[00:35:16] You're just not going from patient to patient every 15 minutes.
[00:35:18] Right.
[00:35:19] You know, for the rest of your career.
[00:35:20] Because you could do that too.
[00:35:21] And, but I want somebody that's like, hey, I got this idea for you.
[00:35:25] You know, things like that.
[00:35:26] So you're kind of that guy.
[00:35:28] And I absolutely appreciate that.
[00:35:30] But yeah, let's talk about.
[00:35:32] So where do you see opportunities with millennials now?
[00:35:36] Like what guidance do they need?
[00:35:38] Because we know that the average first time home buyer is a millennial.
[00:35:41] So how would you tell other agents?
[00:35:44] This is how you relate to a millennial.
[00:35:46] Here are some things they care about.
[00:35:48] You know, what is it that a lot of agents don't understand?
[00:35:51] I think the progress who aren't millennials,
[00:35:54] and I guess people in general who aren't millennials,
[00:35:57] don't understand and happen anything with their experience.
[00:36:01] Just how many weird things our age group has gone through
[00:36:06] and are young adult lives.
[00:36:07] It's like most of us became adults
[00:36:10] when I was like, don't buy a house.
[00:36:12] The market's going to crap.
[00:36:14] I'm a therapy or a attorney graduating from Harvard.
[00:36:17] You still don't have to get a school, you're going to a job.
[00:36:21] And every few years or something,
[00:36:23] but I'm not going to go through the list.
[00:36:25] And whatever, since 2009,
[00:36:27] every few years, there's some big societal thing
[00:36:30] that I think a lot of millennials are like, I just want to pull back
[00:36:35] from making big decisions because so many weird things have happened.
[00:36:39] They're a little bit more mistrustful, I think,
[00:36:41] of the traditional systems.
[00:36:44] Yes, and then in a good way,
[00:36:46] they want to be very prepared for every step they take,
[00:36:49] especially in big financial stuff like buying a house.
[00:36:52] And sometimes people will see a little push,
[00:36:55] especially these days in prices are a little crazy.
[00:36:58] They need to be told what to do and why.
[00:37:03] And we're also very pragmatic in that we need to know
[00:37:08] why we're doing things and we need to want data to support our decisions.
[00:37:13] Yeah, well, you grew up with the internet.
[00:37:15] You were the first generation to have it pretty much your entire life
[00:37:19] for the most part.
[00:37:20] And so you know how to get access to information,
[00:37:23] which is used to be the thing that only the experts had.
[00:37:27] Or if you had an encyclopedia, I guess you maybe could have access to older information.
[00:37:32] But you didn't have access to new and quick information the way,
[00:37:35] I mean, it's just completely different now.
[00:37:37] So you're absolutely right.
[00:37:38] People need to prove themselves a bit more these days on,
[00:37:41] I'm not just a salesperson.
[00:37:43] I actually have the data.
[00:37:45] I know I'm not here to be a SU.
[00:37:48] I am here to actually fill in the gaps in your knowledge.
[00:37:52] And there's so much information out there.
[00:37:54] It's less about having the information and being able to synthesize the information
[00:37:58] for it in the ways that relates to what your client's going through.
[00:38:02] If someone just goes online and searches for three better and condos
[00:38:06] and looking part, for an hour, you're going to be inundated with stuff.
[00:38:11] And you won't, you'll, it's too much.
[00:38:15] And like you said, everyone has access to so much information.
[00:38:17] Everyone before they even sent it to me is their broker.
[00:38:20] It's on redfinity.
[00:38:21] They see the, the 2021 they bought it for 540 and all this stuff.
[00:38:26] Like, which is great.
[00:38:28] But that's no longer our job.
[00:38:30] Our job is to like I said, synthesize all the information
[00:38:33] and tell them what not to, what all of all this information,
[00:38:37] so much of it is unimportant.
[00:38:39] But it seems, everything seems so important to such a big decision,
[00:38:43] especially millennials, because like I said, we want our data.
[00:38:47] So doing that and telling people what to focus on and what's important
[00:38:51] for an investment standpoint and for a lifestyle of living in a property,
[00:38:56] that's what's important for us and what's important for millennials,
[00:39:01] specifically as a nature.
[00:39:03] Yeah, it makes sense.
[00:39:04] I think millennials are used to there.
[00:39:07] They know how to get information.
[00:39:09] They don't always know how to sift through it.
[00:39:12] You're right.
[00:39:13] Like in figuring out what's most important.
[00:39:15] That's where REALTOR may come in and say,
[00:39:18] here's what's important with this data.
[00:39:20] But we have to assume that they are doing their own research.
[00:39:23] They're smart, they grew up doing that.
[00:39:24] They know how to access answers.
[00:39:27] They aren't always trustful of the answers they find,
[00:39:30] because there's a lot of bad information out there.
[00:39:33] But they know how to get it.
[00:39:34] They, you know, it's funny.
[00:39:35] I was talking to a LinkedIn expert the other day.
[00:39:38] And he said, you really have to have a nice looking linked in profile.
[00:39:42] And I said, well, do you really?
[00:39:45] And he said, you do, because if you think younger clients aren't just googling
[00:39:50] you and going to your social links,
[00:39:51] he's like, you're crazy.
[00:39:53] They are absolutely doing that, even if it's your best friend.
[00:39:56] They're looking at it.
[00:39:56] You don't have to have a big, beautiful,
[00:39:58] like I'm the greatest thing ever profile.
[00:40:00] But you have to put a little bit of effort in,
[00:40:02] because everyone's looking up at everything.
[00:40:05] Or at least younger people are.
[00:40:06] And I go, that's a really good point.
[00:40:09] So you're right.
[00:40:10] People are going to look,
[00:40:11] so you really have to be armed with a lot of information.
[00:40:14] Or to know, hey, this is important, this isn't.
[00:40:17] Here's what you need to pay attention to.
[00:40:19] And you're really coming to them with the same knowledge
[00:40:23] that they might have already read.
[00:40:25] But you're being able to sort of sort through it and say,
[00:40:27] here's, because, you know,
[00:40:29] probably a lot of millennials think I would assume there's,
[00:40:32] I would love to see data on this.
[00:40:34] There's probably a lot of millennials that think I could probably do this on my own.
[00:40:37] I could probably buy a house.
[00:40:39] And there's enough articles out there online to say,
[00:40:42] you should do it on your own.
[00:40:43] And that's really where somebody who is a real knowledge
[00:40:48] source can come in and say, well, sure you could.
[00:40:50] You could.
[00:40:51] Here's why people don't.
[00:40:53] Here's why 93% of the country
[00:40:56] used a REALTOR last year.
[00:40:58] And it's not because we have a monopoly on the information.
[00:41:00] You can find any property you want.
[00:41:02] So I love that you said that.
[00:41:04] And I think that is so we have to kind of up our game a little bit
[00:41:06] because we don't have all, we don't,
[00:41:09] we're not the only ones with the knowledge anymore.
[00:41:11] The younger people have it.
[00:41:12] They just don't have the expertise of what's important.
[00:41:15] So I love that.
[00:41:16] Well, Luke, I am so happy that you were able to jump on with us today.
[00:41:21] I want everybody to really check out Luke's Instagram.
[00:41:24] It's Luke Jawwick on Instagram.
[00:41:26] That's L-U-K-E-J-O-R-W-I-C.
[00:41:29] Luke is with James and Sotheby's International.
[00:41:31] He helps clients all throughout Chicago land.
[00:41:34] And although he will tell you if he cannot,
[00:41:37] if he's not an expert in that particular thing,
[00:41:39] but Luke loves being a connector.
[00:41:41] So even if you have questions,
[00:41:43] or if you are somebody who's an agent in another area of the country,
[00:41:47] we have gosh 95% of our audience is not here in Chicago.
[00:41:50] So if you have agents or sorry clients
[00:41:54] who may be moving into Chicago and you're looking for a partner to work with,
[00:41:58] and by the way, Luke works with people that move out of Chicago.
[00:42:01] A lot of times people move south.
[00:42:03] I know my parents have and a lot of people do eventually when it,
[00:42:06] because it is cold here.
[00:42:07] So he's looking for people to refer to as well.
[00:42:10] So reach out to him.
[00:42:11] He's easy to find.
[00:42:12] Follow him on Instagram.
[00:42:13] Just Google him.
[00:42:14] He's all over the place.
[00:42:15] And for anyone Luke,
[00:42:18] that may want to work with you.
[00:42:19] What's the best way they could reach out if not Instagram?
[00:42:22] He's just Instagram's the easiest way to go.
[00:42:25] Call me in midstream millennial, TJ.
[00:42:27] He's a millennial.
[00:42:29] And that's exactly what I did when I was running late.
[00:42:31] I'm like, I hope he sees this.
[00:42:32] He had just turned off his phone because he was a good guest.
[00:42:35] And he turned off his phone.
[00:42:37] And funny enough, that was the one time he didn't see it.
[00:42:40] But he will see it when he Instagram him.
[00:42:42] I want everybody to follow Luke again on Instagram.
[00:42:44] Luke, George, he's easy.
[00:42:46] We have a link to it in the show notes.
[00:42:48] He's awesome.
[00:42:49] Top producer, follow him.
[00:42:51] Do what he's doing.
[00:42:52] Be authentic.
[00:42:54] Have meaning in your business.
[00:42:56] Tell your get your clients back is the main message I heard today.
[00:43:00] Luke is living that reality.
[00:43:03] And he's doing real well.
[00:43:04] And he doesn't ask for business.
[00:43:05] And he doesn't like to ask for referrals or anything
[00:43:08] because he just wants to do what he's good at.
[00:43:11] And it works for him.
[00:43:12] So Luke, on behalf of the audience,
[00:43:14] thank you.
[00:43:15] On behalf of the audience, Luke and myself,

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.

Let us know what you think of the show. All right, let's get to it. My conversation with Luke Jorwick. All right, my guest today is Luke Jorwick, with a here in Chicago, with Jameson Sotheby's International. Let me tell you about Luke. He's a top 1% producer. And for over 12 years, Luke has been part of one of the top teams in the Chicago land area. He grew up in Elmhurst, which is a suburb here in Chicago. But real estate was always at the top of Luke's mind, and his unique point of view and experience has helped him guide his clients when purchasing, selling, and investing in real estate since 2012. He's the youngest of four children. He grew up with dozens of family members in Elmhurst and the surrounding areas. The experience of having family members from two to 90 years old in Elmhurst provides Luke with an unmatched understanding of the town. And the way of life there. Luke is a graduate of York High School and Loyola University here in Chicago. After college, he lived and invested in properties in River North and Lincoln Park. More recently, Luke has moved back to Elmhurst and renovated a home right near his family's home with his Bernadoodle named Lady, which is, I might have to see a picture of a Bernadoodle. I'm not sure I know Bernadoodle, but that's awesome. And doesn't shit. His parents lived nearby in the same home that they have been in the family, has been in the family for over 50 years. Helping clients purchase in sell real estate is endlessly fulfilling and Luke prides himself on his honesty, his work ethic, and innate ability to listen deeply and understand each client's unique needs. Each real estate transaction, of course, is different and has its own challenges and triumphs. Luke would love the opportunity to work with you. And he's just a heck of a nice guy. I want everybody to follow Luke on his Instagram, which is Luke, George JORWIC. I will have a link to that in the show notes. Follow him on Instagram. Luke, welcome to the show. Thank you. I am really excited. I have to sort of peel back the curtain. I went into a complete panic right before, right 158, two minutes before airtime because my computer decided to update. And I knew it was supposed to update today, but I didn't think it would update right when I was trying to get Luke on and Luke and I were not connected on social media. And I couldn't even look up his phone number. I'm like, please, I'm here. I just waited. So Luke is a gracious guy. And I am really excited to talk to him. And I will calm down from my freak out from earlier. And really, I want to learn about Luke. So Luke, tell me a little bit about yourself. I know you grew up in the suburbs. What brought you into real estate? I always was obsessed with real estate. When I was looking at graduate high school 2009, when I graduated, I really wanted to go to the Paul. I actually had a real estate mad degree. It was 2009. My parents were like, maybe you should get a degree in something other than real estate. Now the market just is tanking. Let's do something else. Yeah, all we're hearing is terrible things about real estate. But much to their just an egg at the beginning and kidding. I went a little bit of a different degree, but always loved real estate. And between my junior senior years, I started working for my current team, actually. As a name, I just never learned. I worked for my junior year and was clear. Wow. So as a senior, were you selling or were you more supporting the team? Maybe it's doing both. I got my license that during that summer, where you had to have a license to do anything meaningful. Sure. You're like showing, you're really getting to show a property, obviously, without a license. So I just got that summer. So I was working as an assistant, Ralthus talent. And just never, I remember the only conversation you really ever had about it was, right, for graduation, they were just like, really stick with this, right? You see, yeah. Here we are. That's amazing. We have a, it's funny. We get a lot of emails and social media messages from people that are in their early 20s. And I love to talk to people who started in their early as 20s, because it seems daunting. It seems like that would be a challenge. And getting somebody to help you, maybe you'll trust you, to of course help them purchase or sell, or did you do a lot of rentals back then, because I imagine your peer group at 21 was mostly renting or how did you get those? You did a lot of rentals. But I just started. I just, even with my team, there was really no formal process. We just, I just got thrown in. I figured it out. I mean, my first appointment was a final walk through. Not even know what that meant. No threat for closing the new chair. It's okay. The unit is not high rise. It's a pinnacle. They were just like, yeah, just go to nine o'clock. The door will be the key. It'll be fine. And I figured it out. There was some issue with like, the team year move. They're no work out. He was trying to call someone to pick up. So yeah, I was just trial by fire. And luckily, we knew lots of people. I did lots of rentals in the beginning, but you just stuck with it. And how many years later is that? For 13 and a half, most four years. Yeah. Yeah, still doing it. It's really fun. I think it's crazy that real estate not crazy, but it's always interesting to do that real estate is such a, is a very common second job, like a career change job, because the thought of having a salary, kind of, I joke all the time, that sounds great. But I never knew that. So this just weird crazy way of making a living is the only thing I know. The idea of like having a 401k of the map from the quitting to the Celerial State Sons and Sons and Sons. That must be nice. Like you got to just stay. Health insurance? What? That would be great. There's a figure of health insurance. You're not going to do it, at least. I pay myself. I pay myself. I've been asked corporations. So even though I'm technically an employee of my own company, I don't have very health insurance. Either I have, you know, traditional individual insurance. And I was at the dentist yesterday. And, you know, it's just, it's so painful to pay. So I'm like, I can't wait to get married and hopefully get on someone else's group plan. But I wanted to touch on something that you mentioned about part time. Because most agents or most people that have a license are part time, which is really interesting. And they have other jobs in a lot of cases. And I talk to agents who are full time, of course, on the show, everyone's full time, just like you. You work so much and you work so hard and well into the evenings because it is, of course, your business. And I can't imagine doing both. I mean, to me, it would, of course, be nice with the benefits. But I don't know how, even just doing one deal on top of your regular job seems like a very daunting task. Yeah, I don't understand how people could do that. I mean, more hard to them. But just even the mental load of just having one deal going on, I can't imagine thinking of any females. But people do it. I don't understand why you'd want to work with somebody as a part time broker. I'm sure they're great part time brokers. But for myself, I couldn't imagine doing this doing something else. It is a tricky schedule just having this job. So I can't imagine doing it while doing it. So it's 2025. And I want to talk a little bit about challenges. I really talk about this. And I think it's really interesting to our audience because everyone struggles, everyone's business is imperfect. Everyone's got something that they want to work on or they know they should work on just out of curiosity because you are a incredibly successful agent. You do very, very well. And people certainly aspire to that, but they don't relate to it as much. So let's humanize you a little bit. And let's talk about what currently, we have challenges in the market right now. We have low inventory. We have rates where we would prefer them not to be. So for you personally, where are you finding like, I need to work on this part of my business. Oh, so many different things. I'm the worst at marketing myself. It's going to funny. I'm on a podcast right now. But I hate asking for testimonials. I don't get embarrassed like sending postcards with my sales. I just dislike it. It's so funny. And it's not funny. So it's just what you need to do. No one, you know, the clothes not doesn't get fed, but I hate it. And I just, I can't, I can't do it. When I used to, in the different buildings, I'd live in everyone. It's like the first thing you do, oh, you come a building expert. You say I live here and I sold this unit and it's the new boss. You know, it's very tricky, but you know, it works for your first one. And I've never, I've never sold a centipede scarter in the nature of building I've lived in until after I moved out. I don't know. I wish I, it's just, I think it's those things you're, you have to work, I have to work on it. I've gotten better at it. But I just, you're the person who loves doing that. It's okay. But I just, thanks for skinning, we're all. I'll tell you, I have the same exact feeling. I don't practice real estate myself, but those same sorts of things asking for testimonials, asking for business even. It is something that you look, you are proof that you don't have to do those things necessarily or you don't have to be loving doing them because you are incredibly successful, even though you might not be asking. I need a review. I need a testimonial. Hey, do you know anyone else who might need my services? It's amazing because a lot of times our audience and really anyone who's not at the top of the mountain yet thinks, well, everyone does everything. They just do it all. They do it effortlessly. You know, they work hard, but it's not really that hard for them. They just put in the hours. And I'm with you. I, to ask for business, to ask for something from somebody. I find that to be very just not easy for me to do as well. You know, I recruit REALTORS. I've never once asked a REALTOR, so are you ready to join us? Like, I've just, I guess I'm afraid of the no or something, but I just don't want to ask that. So I think that's incredibly relatable. And hopefully our audience listening thinking, well, gosh, I'm not good at that either. It's okay. You don't have to be. You can always aspire to be, but you don't have to be. And that's the coolest part about this podcast, or not about the podcast, but about doing this podcast, because people do it in all sorts of different ways. So I appreciate your honesty there. And you can very, very relatable thing. I think, you know, even asking friends for business, I, I, I, I, I, that would be a tough one. Yeah. So like, you don't have to, like, I'll be like, you know, I'm like, just for the record, even if I am trying to get the business. And I mean, like, you know, it's not, it's not, I'm not trying to get the, and I get it. You're living in a broker. I know great brokers. I'm just like, no, just asked to say, I've gotten better at that individually. With one to one, one to one, I wonder with people I know. Especially over time, it's like, yeah, because I know what to do. It's a user like, tell yourself, I actually, I'm the first person to this job. But I also will never like, you know, areas I don't know, or types of properties. I don't know, which I can't do. I think I'm from one, but I'm not going to be like, oh, you know, feel like you're in Libertyville. Sure, I'll do it. I've never been to Libertyville. So I'm not going to tell you I can do that. Like I'm not. So it's because a lot of brokers do. They're like, sure, I'll do it anywhere. And more power to them, I'm sure they're great. But I know especially on the neighborhoods in Chicago, I know very well. And in Elmer's specifically too, it's like, you laugh when something that you know, this is the market for six months sells. And you laugh and you see it sold. So some broker from out of town, you're like, oh, yeah, that's why they paid that price. Because they've never been here before. They don't know that like, it was on the market for eight months because you know, it shouldn't be that price. Right. No, it's it's a I really appreciate that. And I think to there's something to there's something very powerful about saying, I don't do that. Or I'm not the right person for that. To me, when I hear you say that, I hear honesty, I hear authenticity. And I hear courage, right? The courage to say, I'm not the right person. And I like you enough as a possible client to give you to somebody else. And maybe you refer it out or you have a partner somewhere, you know, if somebody says, I want to sell a factory. And you're like, I don't really know how to do that. Maybe you do, but a lot of agents don't. But there are people that do. And that's all they do is sell factories. And as hard as it is to give away, maybe that business, it really, I think ultimately comes back. I always love like I always love when I go into a store. And person talks me out of buying something, which isn't that common. But what I do, and they go, you know what, you don't want to buy that. Don't get that like either wait until it goes on sale, or it's not for you. Or I love when people say that like, I love when I find it's not to buy this. It saves us all time. It's especially in this tight inventory market, it's hard because it has been this way for years. It's like every year it's like, all inventory sites, it's been tight since like 2015. This is not new news. It's gotten worse, but it's always been, like people just want to show their clients places. And I always say it's like the first few times you go out, especially when you're working with a buyer, it's like, I'll show you anything, because you need to go on the market and when something hits, you need to be able to make that decision. But after a while, people especially in this market get a little more desperate and I'm like, wow, I might buy this. And she's like, no, don't, because I'm not going to do buy it. Because I have to then hopefully sell it one day if what you call me. And there's three, you know, there's different reasons you should have places that don't work for different people for different reasons. So I know you just said you want a place of two garage spots in an elevator and this is a walk up loft on the third floor. You're not going to be happy here. Since the first time. And you also too, you are super, aware that if you were to recommend something that you didn't feel was in their best interest, that's a violation of your own ethics. Forget about the National Association of REALTORS Code of Ethics, which it is do. But it's actually something that you, I can tell you're a very authentic person. So I want to talk a little bit about your why. So tell us about what it means to you to get to work with buyers and sellers. I always, I'm very fascinated with how people live in their homes. I'm a huge homebody, which is hard with this job, because you have to leave and I love the pandemic and I can't deny. But growing up, like my, the house that grew up in was always, my parents are both the oldest, their family. And we're most of the oldest of our cousins on my one side of the family. So everything was just at our house. And my parents also bought that house to live in from my grandparents. Oh, wow. So who are still alive when they bought it? Like 25 years ago. So everything's naturally all the events there at our house. It just happens. And I have a little brother who's two years older than he was autism. So it's always easier to have stuff at our house. Everything's been at our house. So it's like my whole life is just entertaining, having people over. And I really get a kick out of figuring out how people live currently and their goals and how they want to live in the future. And I can tell, and because I've known this for so long, I can just picture where someone's going to live, a lot of times before they can. Just from getting to know them, saying, you know, it's just to know a question to ask, to get to know a client. And that's what I love. Like I love like a year later, getting a text from a client sitting in their sunroom. And being like, I never even knew I wanted a sunroom. You know, thank you so much. Just ran them stuff like that. Is why I do this and what gets you through the downs of the ups and downs of a life in real estate. There are plenty of them. Is that and then just the relationships in my clients. It's just very fun and makes each day different, which I love. I just like to ask this of my guests that after a sale, you know, the stats, the data says they probably aren't moving for seven to ten years or whatever the current number is. What are you doing in between? So you've sold them the home or they've, you know, either purchased or sold a home. What are you doing to stay top of or back of mind or top of mind? How are you staying in touch? I love and it's different because it's, you know, it's so easy to be in touch. You know, these days, you know, we've got texts, you've got social media, you've got every weird little tick-tock, you know, I don't do a tick-tock, but I should. I was really excited when I was getting potentially going to shut down. I would still do it. So I don't want to get started there, but I should. But anything you can be doing, there's so many ways. And it's just, a lot of times it's just intuitive. Like you'll be driving past a house that makes you think, it just makes you think of a client or their house or a comp. And it's just making the time to do it right away and you think about it. Or at least make a note. Reject these people because even if it's people you weren't as serally and kind of being close to, you know, you know, you know, I'm kind of trying to follow your lines. It's just important to stay in touch not only to be kind of in mind, but to help them with stuff. Like you want to be that person who they go to and they're like, oh, I have this lead. Do you have someone? You know, just like don't. I'll find someone, you know, I don't know if you can call you. But it's funny because one of our managing broker, if Jameson calls it one night standing, your clients, if you just if you sell it and call it eventually. So which is a good way to think of it. It is a really good way to think of it. You're right. In the first couple of times, you have to be intentional about it. Like I was 60 days out, check in, you know, remember, but what, you know, they're by anniversary of them buying, you check in, stuff like that. So those those things you have to do. And that is the effort of it. But the rest of it is I'd rather contact them last. I don't have a content calendar, which again, I'm sure everyone said you should. I don't have one of those. I don't like send out emails to my entire client list all the time. But as long as those the first few times, I've set them up and I can do contact everyone on their anniversaries of their sales, etc. But then after that, it's all just reality of when I think of them. It's not can try, which I think makes it more valuable. Like I'd rather have two or three, you know, I was doing a Christmas card, obviously, do a holiday party and you might buy your anniversary. So everyone's here for me four times a year on things that are just standard that they're going to hear. And then every other time I've been challenged them, it's legitimately just what I thought of them. Which I view is better than I'd rather have five touches a year than 12 if they're all fake, not fake, but can try their thought of ahead of time. I agree. I wrote an article once for a real estate magazine called Nobody Wants to Read Your Newsletter. And it's, you know, look, I guess a newsletter is better if you're doing nothing than it's better than nothing. But a reach out, a phone call, I was just thinking about you, are we thinking about your property or just, you know, came into my mind, that's going to trump the best newsletter that's out there. You're absolutely right. And I do like, there's a couple of brokers who do newsletters that I really like. Because they're there actually about what things they like. And like Jeff, you know, Jeff Lentron, you know, Jeff Wilson, out of DC, his newsletter is great. I'm going to be my personal email and my working, and I love each one of them. I'll tell you to Nicole Hajdu here in Chicago. She does top things to do in the city. She sends it out on Wednesday. She says top things to do in the suburbs. And every Wednesday, it's so brilliant because she's been on the show as well. Because everybody here, at least, you know, who lives in some sort of area where there's things going on, we're always like, what are we going to do this weekend around Wednesday? We start thinking about it. And I always go to Nicole's email and I'm like, thank you. And if for some reason she weren't to send it out, I would actually be disappointed. So you're right. If you're going to do a newsletter, make it something that you're passionate about and that your clients actually want. You know, I always think like, you're client, you know, clients want to know things like what's their home worth and there could be a way, I guess you can't really scale that. But you know, that's always something that's a conversation piece that could be done, text email, I guess a newsletter of sorts. But I want to talk about, I want to also talk about millennials because you are a millennial as well. I did the math right in the middle. Right in the middle. And what's really interesting is millennials in particular are buying homes later. So this just happened last year, I believe, the age of a first time home buyer went from, I think it was 35 up to now 38 years old. And what's interesting about that, and this isn't my data. I heard Dr. Yoon from the National Association of REALTORS talk about this. He was saying there's actually a problem with this. And the problem isn't that real estate agents have to wait a little longer for their clients to buy. It's that the generational wealth, or even just the wealth within one generation, is now they're missing out on, I know about 10 years of growth. We know that homes typically raise in value over time, over long swaths of time. So he actually mentioned like this is a problem. So I'm curious about, how are you seeing millennials treat the housing market? Are you seeing more rentals? Are you trying to educate them? Or are you just sort of accepting that that's where they're at? So I'm curious to get your take. I've seen it a lot of different ways. It's a lot, it's obviously the societal issue, the one you'll camp at houses of student debt and raising costs, and our interest rates in the last few years are very serious. And people I have seen wait longer for sure. But I have sort of bucked the trend, and I tell people not to. I bought my first house in S23. But I was in a house as a stretch. It was a studio, I put 10% down. And I'm in now in my sixth property. So I just jumped in and started doing it. And it talked to all my friends about it through the process. And it's actually something I always say people, since people are waiting, they'd be a little more awake longer. And they wanted to, I'm going to buy a house, I'm already 32. I want to buy housing being a long time. I'm always of the mind, buy a house, it's a good investment, and you're fine, no matter how long you live there. Luckily obviously the market's been great for the last 12 years, 13 years. But either way, if you buy something that's good value, the check's all the boxes, and you don't put yourself in a position to have to sell, you're not going to lose money. So that is such a, I want to just pause for more. That is such a really intelligent and thoughtful way to look at it. Because people want to purchase based on what they want, and what they think will give them the, for the most part, not everyone. But the vast majority of first-time home buyers in particular, want to buy something that they're really excited about because of the way that it's structured or what the amenities it has. And I like the fact that you might say to them, hey, this does have all of that. And there may be some challenges with home valuation with this particular property. I like that that you bring that in. That is an incredibly interesting thing. Because you say, I don't know when you're going to move out. You might have to move out in two years. Life gets in the way. Life changes. You might, and I don't want this to be something that you regret simply because the market timing might not be great. So you are the first person I have ever heard say that. And I really, really admire that. So tell me a little bit more about that. How you sort of make those determinations. I mean, it's each client's different. I'm happy to help people. I'm the least pushy person in the world. I will never be like, you should buy, read this article, generation of wealth. I mean, I love real estate brokers. But the line of create generation of wealth through real estate. It's like, we're not economists. We're not your financial advisor. Right. Like, just, I mean, brokers need to chill out a little bit. And it's just about talking to that client, helping them through what's right for them. And then having their back, because at the end of the day, that's really what I think our job is. Is knowing that if in two years, this person loses their job or their spouse gets a job across the country, they're in a position to get out or rent. And it's an ill-dick with assets. So you have to take so much more consideration when purchasing it. Or rent in a place. If there's so many variables that I think it's our job to think about, I always find it's that leaves the stressing up to me and you just find a house you like. And I'll make sure everything else is taken care of. Not going to sell you in a building that's financially bad. Not a rent you in a building that I've heard is crap, because we all know those buildings. It's stuff like that. It's just, I want to make sure my clients are happy so that they keep sending me more clients. It's like, I don't even think about, I don't even keep a track of what deals I have pending that really should. Or financially, like a lot of broker are like, oh, what money do I have coming in? I don't even look at that. Because I know the more time I've sent on that, the less I'm sending to you on my clients. So if you just focus on your clients and having their back, it's all that matters. And that's all they'll remember. And there may be times where you tell people you should rent right now, because for the X, Y and Z reason, and I love that. My boss told me to do that. I own a place now, but years ago, I was thinking about buying and I wasn't sure when to get into the market. And I just wasn't sure. I owned before, but I was renting at the time. And I go, really, I don't feel good renting. I should buy it. He goes, keep renting rent for another year. He's like, you get better stuff. You get what you want. And it's not the right time. And I was like, okay. And I was so grateful that he did that. Because I would have found a place. And I would have bought something. And maybe it would have worked out. Maybe it wouldn't have. But I love that when people, like you said, when people really have your back, that's really all we want in a service professional. We all have access to Zillow. The public has access to Zillow. They can find properties all day long. They don't really need us for that. They need us to see all the things they can't see. And that's what you're doing. And I, Guy, very, very much appreciate that. And you're also, but you're also an investor. So you are a guy that likes buying properties. I love buying real estate. My favorite thing to do. I've run it on crazy. I'm always like, why don't I go to move next? I've ever been to some crazy. Like even right now, I live in a house. It's two blocks from my one sister. And this is Zillow and some other block this way. And my parents live four blocks this way. So I happen to have a move. Oh, and I like a great rate, of course. But I'm always literally in like, oh, should I have some market? Like I'm smart too. Oh, nice to meet you. I always, and crazy. And I love that rush event. It's nothing better. I literally was seeing this week about selling. And I probably will. But that's all I'm sorry. You know, we're hearing, I hear the passion. And I think that's so important. It really probably drives you when times are difficult. And when the market's not cooperating and other agents maybe aren't cooperating or you're losing deals because of whatever reason. And the idea of like that itch of wanting to do it for yourself, wanting to do it for your clients, and just sort of do the right thing. So everybody wins is really powerful. It's very infectious. It comes across really authentically in how you present. And I think that is, you know, a real... People want to be around people. They feel are really into things. The whatever that it is they're doing. Like I want my accountant to be into accounting. Like I want her to just be like, oh my god, I just read this cool thing. I want to try it with your business or whatever. I love stuff like that. And I want my dentist to be really into dentistry. You know, it sounds silly. But a lot of people just work a job. And they're happy with it. It's okay. But they're not really into it in the way that I would want them to be. Right? And so I search those people out. And you certainly seem to be of that ilk. And I think that's very, very attractive to clients. And it probably means you don't have to do some of the traditional marketing that other agents do. Because that's not really your thing. Your thing is this authentic. I'm on your side. I should do more though. I'm sent to be like, I know I need to do more. Well, everybody needs to do more everything. We all need to eat better. We need to work out. We need to take better. We need to call our mothers. But more, there's always things to do. And I agree. Yeah, we always strive for more and better. And at the same time, we want to make sure we do that authentically. And I think you are demonstrating that. I'm really, really impressed with it. Comes through very, very effortlessly. Because you're clearly into it. And I love that. And I always tell people who are struggling in this business. Maybe you're just not into it enough. Like get into it. You know, yes, cold calls. If you do those, they're going to always suck. Like all of that stuff always sucks. But so do pushups and so do lots of things in life. Lots of things in life that are good for us suck. But you can still get into learning. I think learning is where it is. Is what's, you know, I find to be like when people really want to learn, even throughout their entire career, you know, I love when my dermatologist is like, I just was that, but dermatologist. And they're like, oh, I just read this article. I want to talk to you about it. I was like, I'm so glad you're still reading. Like I love that. You're just not going from patient to patient every 15 minutes. Right. You know, for the rest of your career. Because you could do that too. And, but I want somebody that's like, hey, I got this idea for you. You know, things like that. So you're kind of that guy. And I absolutely appreciate that. But yeah, let's talk about. So where do you see opportunities with millennials now? Like what guidance do they need? Because we know that the average first time home buyer is a millennial. So how would you tell other agents? This is how you relate to a millennial. Here are some things they care about. You know, what is it that a lot of agents don't understand? I think the progress who aren't millennials, and I guess people in general who aren't millennials, don't understand and happen anything with their experience. Just how many weird things our age group has gone through and are young adult lives. It's like most of us became adults when I was like, don't buy a house. The market's going to crap. I'm a therapy or a attorney graduating from Harvard. You still don't have to get a school, you're going to a job. And every few years or something, but I'm not going to go through the list. And whatever, since 2009, every few years, there's some big societal thing that I think a lot of millennials are like, I just want to pull back from making big decisions because so many weird things have happened. They're a little bit more mistrustful, I think, of the traditional systems. Yes, and then in a good way, they want to be very prepared for every step they take, especially in big financial stuff like buying a house. And sometimes people will see a little push, especially these days in prices are a little crazy. They need to be told what to do and why. And we're also very pragmatic in that we need to know why we're doing things and we need to want data to support our decisions. Yeah, well, you grew up with the internet. You were the first generation to have it pretty much your entire life for the most part. And so you know how to get access to information, which is used to be the thing that only the experts had. Or if you had an encyclopedia, I guess you maybe could have access to older information. But you didn't have access to new and quick information the way, I mean, it's just completely different now. So you're absolutely right. People need to prove themselves a bit more these days on, I'm not just a salesperson. I actually have the data. I know I'm not here to be a SU. I am here to actually fill in the gaps in your knowledge. And there's so much information out there. It's less about having the information and being able to synthesize the information for it in the ways that relates to what your client's going through. If someone just goes online and searches for three better and condos and looking part, for an hour, you're going to be inundated with stuff. And you won't, you'll, it's too much. And like you said, everyone has access to so much information. Everyone before they even sent it to me is their broker. It's on redfinity. They see the, the 2021 they bought it for 540 and all this stuff. Like, which is great. But that's no longer our job. Our job is to like I said, synthesize all the information and tell them what not to, what all of all this information, so much of it is unimportant. But it seems, everything seems so important to such a big decision, especially millennials, because like I said, we want our data. So doing that and telling people what to focus on and what's important for an investment standpoint and for a lifestyle of living in a property, that's what's important for us and what's important for millennials, specifically as a nature. Yeah, it makes sense. I think millennials are used to there. They know how to get information. They don't always know how to sift through it. You're right. Like in figuring out what's most important. That's where REALTOR may come in and say, here's what's important with this data. But we have to assume that they are doing their own research. They're smart, they grew up doing that. They know how to access answers. They aren't always trustful of the answers they find, because there's a lot of bad information out there. But they know how to get it. They, you know, it's funny. I was talking to a LinkedIn expert the other day. And he said, you really have to have a nice looking linked in profile. And I said, well, do you really? And he said, you do, because if you think younger clients aren't just googling you and going to your social links, he's like, you're crazy. They are absolutely doing that, even if it's your best friend. They're looking at it. You don't have to have a big, beautiful, like I'm the greatest thing ever profile. But you have to put a little bit of effort in, because everyone's looking up at everything. Or at least younger people are. And I go, that's a really good point. So you're right. People are going to look, so you really have to be armed with a lot of information. Or to know, hey, this is important, this isn't. Here's what you need to pay attention to. And you're really coming to them with the same knowledge that they might have already read. But you're being able to sort of sort through it and say, here's, because, you know, probably a lot of millennials think I would assume there's, I would love to see data on this. There's probably a lot of millennials that think I could probably do this on my own. I could probably buy a house. And there's enough articles out there online to say, you should do it on your own. And that's really where somebody who is a real knowledge source can come in and say, well, sure you could. You could. Here's why people don't. Here's why 93% of the country used a REALTOR last year. And it's not because we have a monopoly on the information. You can find any property you want. So I love that you said that. And I think that is so we have to kind of up our game a little bit because we don't have all, we don't, we're not the only ones with the knowledge anymore. The younger people have it. They just don't have the expertise of what's important. So I love that. Well, Luke, I am so happy that you were able to jump on with us today. I want everybody to really check out Luke's Instagram. It's Luke Jawwick on Instagram. That's L-U-K-E-J-O-R-W-I-C. Luke is with James and Sotheby's International. He helps clients all throughout Chicago land. And although he will tell you if he cannot, if he's not an expert in that particular thing, but Luke loves being a connector. So even if you have questions, or if you are somebody who's an agent in another area of the country, we have gosh 95% of our audience is not here in Chicago. So if you have agents or sorry clients who may be moving into Chicago and you're looking for a partner to work with, and by the way, Luke works with people that move out of Chicago. A lot of times people move south. I know my parents have and a lot of people do eventually when it, because it is cold here. So he's looking for people to refer to as well. So reach out to him. He's easy to find. Follow him on Instagram. Just Google him. He's all over the place. And for anyone Luke, that may want to work with you. What's the best way they could reach out if not Instagram? He's just Instagram's the easiest way to go. Call me in midstream millennial, TJ. He's a millennial. And that's exactly what I did when I was running late. I'm like, I hope he sees this. He had just turned off his phone because he was a good guest. And he turned off his phone. And funny enough, that was the one time he didn't see it. But he will see it when he Instagram him. I want everybody to follow Luke again on Instagram. Luke, George, he's easy. We have a link to it in the show notes. He's awesome. Top producer, follow him. Do what he's doing. Be authentic. Have meaning in your business. Tell your get your clients back is the main message I heard today. Luke is living that reality. And he's doing real well. And he doesn't ask for business. And he doesn't like to ask for referrals or anything because he just wants to do what he's good at. And it works for him. So Luke, on behalf of the audience, thank you.
