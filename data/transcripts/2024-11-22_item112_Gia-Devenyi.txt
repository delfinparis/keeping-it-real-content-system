[00:03:53] Thank you so much for having me DJ. I really appreciate the invite and excited to be here.
[00:04:00] Well, I learned about you at an event, which was like a month or a month or two ago at an A&N mortgage and they had you speak on a panel and you were so outstanding.
[00:04:14] I was like, I got to get I have to get you on our podcast. So welcome. We're excited to have you and I'm just excited to have another local Chicago person on who I have.
[00:04:23] I don't have a lot of Chicago people on these days. So this is really fun for me and our listeners are going to really appreciate what you have to talk about. But let's let's start with your story. So how and why did you get into real estate?
[00:04:35] Sure. Well, it was a long, long time ago DJ.
[00:04:43] Okay, so basically it really was a long time ago on I was 20. I was honestly around like 2021 years old.
[00:04:51] And my father was getting into flipping properties. So essentially he was an investor and he kept nudging me to get my real estate license and honestly it really did not sound that desirable to me at the time I was a little bit young, possibly a bit immature.
[00:05:15] What a 21 year old who's immature. That's impossible.
[00:05:19] I know right. So it's crazy. So like so I'm I didn't go to I didn't go to college and I was aspiring to be a tennis player right.
[00:05:30] Yeah.
[00:05:34] But I knew that you know I had to have some other options out there and my dad did keep kind of dangling the carrot and saying, hey, look, I'm starting to purchase a lot of properties.
[00:05:46] It'd be so cool as my daughter to be the listing agent.
[00:05:49] And like I could really get you into this and we really started off on the investor side of things. So before I actually got licensed, I actually used to be a almost like a photographer for my dad, but a different kind of photographer, not the one that goes and takes beautiful pictures of homes.
[00:06:08] It was a little bit different because these were for share of sales and my dad used to take me to the options and we used to bid on properties and this is right back in 2006.
[00:06:26] So I'm sure you know where this might be going.
[00:06:29] 
[00:06:29] Yeah.
[00:06:30] The good old recession. So I agreed to get my license in 2006. Finally, I did.
[00:06:38] And as it happened, the market crashed and I was about 22 years old and it was, it was unexplainable to me, meaning as I just didn't understand how to navigate it.
[00:06:53] I was so young. What do I do now? Yeah.
[00:06:56] Totally. It was like, what do I do now?
[00:06:58] And it was interesting to say the least. So I started off in the industry like that. I was actually a suburb agent in Naperville.
[00:07:07] I did a lot of the western suburbs. I did a lot of the southern suburbs as well.
[00:07:14] And you know, it was just a whole different market than where I am right now. But I will say this. I did learn a lot.
[00:07:22] My parents always said to me, if you can stick this out, Jeeha, how many years it will be. I never predicted how many years that recession was going to be.
[00:07:31] A lot of tears were shed.
[00:07:34] But it was definitely one of those things that I'm really grateful that I listened to my parents and I stuck through it.
[00:07:42] And they're like, if you do this, you will come out on top.
[00:07:46] But you know, I do believe that because of the recession and the age I was at getting into it.
[00:07:54] It kind of, I don't want to say it like set me back a little bit, but I feel like my career didn't really get started until I came to the city, which was like in 2000 and almost 13.
[00:08:05] So you basically did like almost a reverse move, right? A lot of people here in Chicago, they, they're here in the city and in their early 20s. They have city life. They love it. And then like, I want to go have more space and be out in the burbs.
[00:08:19] And I think it's certainly the flight out there. And I like that you did the reverse flight because I'm a city person as well. So I very much appreciate that.
[00:08:26] And do you do enjoy selling more? And again, I know you sell not just in the city. Of course, you go where your clients need you do prefer to sell not that ones better than the other.
[00:08:36] But is it more fun to sell in the suburbs in the city? What do you like to do?
[00:08:40] Yeah, I mean, like I'll be honest, like it's so fast paced out here in the city. This was always my my vibe.
[00:08:46] When I was, I had a wonderful managing broker who was like, who was my, my mentor at Ryan Hill Realty. It was called back in Napier Bell. And he always said to me, gee, what are you doing?
[00:08:59] Yeah, yeah. And I was like, I'm a city man. You need to be in the city or city girl. And I'm like, Jack, I'm old. Like I'm at the time of be like 27. You know, like everyone's so I know I know and that I look back and I'm like, what am I thinking but it's just like, you know, I you see all these people that are starting to move back a like 29.30.31.32. Have kids. And I just really didn't think that I don't know. I doubted myself, honestly.
[00:09:20] and I got to the city, super fast pace.
[00:09:24] I loved it.
[00:09:25] These past 10, 11, 12 years, whatever it's been,
[00:09:29] have been amazing.
[00:09:31] And, but I will say this, I do not mind going to the suburbs
[00:09:36] and pulling into a driveway.
[00:09:38] And I love it.
[00:09:41] 
[00:09:41] Yeah.
[00:09:41] Like, you know, like the rides are kind of meditative.
[00:09:45] And so I don't mind doing that at all,
[00:09:47] but I think if I was to pick one market over the other,
[00:09:51] yes, I would, I'm going to be a city agent all the way
[00:09:55] as long as I can tell, but I'm, as long as it future holds.
[00:09:59] Yeah, I feel the same way.
[00:10:01] I'm a city living, I've been living here for almost 20,
[00:10:04] I think 24, 25 years in the city.
[00:10:06] And I'm certainly open to moving wherever I ever have to,
[00:10:10] but I prefer the city.
[00:10:13] But there's a funny thing that people who don't live
[00:10:15] in the city of Chicago wouldn't know
[00:10:17] is that people who live in the city,
[00:10:19] especially women have this even, I think,
[00:10:20] more so than men, obviously, is this like,
[00:10:22] there's always a little bit of like,
[00:10:24] a little bit of fear and a little bit of danger.
[00:10:26] We live in Chicago.
[00:10:27] We always have that.
[00:10:28] And I live in Wicker Park, you're in Avondale,
[00:10:31] both nice areas.
[00:10:32] And there's always still a little bit of like,
[00:10:34] looking over my shoulder at night.
[00:10:36] But it is a lot of fun and there's a lot to do.
[00:10:39] And, you know, I just walked outside on the Milwaukee
[00:10:41] this weekend and went to a comedy show,
[00:10:43] like 10 steps before I live, you know,
[00:10:45] so you can't really beat that.
[00:10:47] But I do love pulling into a driveway
[00:10:48] when I visit my friends as well and say,
[00:10:50] oh, this is what a home looks like.
[00:10:51] I keep forgetting what real homes look like.
[00:10:54] Yeah.
[00:10:55] But let's talk about making that transition
[00:10:57] from the suburbs to the city because it doesn't necessarily
[00:11:01] mean that your clients are also moving into the city.
[00:11:04] Or, you know, those are kind of,
[00:11:05] could be two sort of separate worlds,
[00:11:07] obviously, people who live in the suburbs,
[00:11:09] no people who live in the city,
[00:11:10] but was that a difficult transition
[00:11:11] just to find clientele when he moved in?
[00:11:14] It was honestly just like probably
[00:11:16] one of the hardest times of my life.
[00:11:18] On, I, yeah, because I didn't have any clientele
[00:11:23] in the city, I really didn't.
[00:11:25] And like, I was, I was honestly,
[00:11:26] I was going through a breakup
[00:11:28] and it was like a really long-term relationship.
[00:11:30] And I kind of like just, I like broke my lease early
[00:11:34] from, I was living in Lyle and like,
[00:11:38] broke up with my boyfriend, then broke my lease.
[00:11:41] And my, my, my managing broker,
[00:11:43] I was talking about this as I met her,
[00:11:44] encouraged me, like, go now.
[00:11:46] So I did.
[00:11:47] And I literally didn't have anything to bring with me.
[00:11:51] And I'll be real with you.
[00:11:52] I did not have like a savvy CRM from,
[00:11:56] and in a lot of us, I think,
[00:11:58] didn't either at that time really,
[00:12:00] like things were just a lot different
[00:12:01] than they were.
[00:12:02] I was, was Instagram around.
[00:12:03] I think it was, but it was like,
[00:12:05] barely, for being artsy,
[00:12:07] which, you know, I would post like cool pictures, right?
[00:12:11] But, right.
[00:12:12] So, you know, I think, yes, sorry,
[00:12:15] I like to really talk a lot,
[00:12:17] but yes, you're so, you're so nailed it on the high.
[00:12:20] Like it, it was difficult.
[00:12:22] It was so hard for me.
[00:12:23] I struggled.
[00:12:25] I was, I was honestly, I was really broke.
[00:12:28] I had to learn the hard way.
[00:12:30] And it really, it really took a while for me
[00:12:35] to be able to get my feet on the ground with things.
[00:12:38] I had to make literally all new friends.
[00:12:41] I had some friends that were from my high school
[00:12:44] that still live in the city,
[00:12:45] but, you know, I was going through that breakup,
[00:12:47] and that breakup was actually a friend
[00:12:48] from my high school.
[00:12:49] Oh, no.
[00:12:51] So, I lost a lot of front.
[00:12:52] Yeah, you know, that complicates things.
[00:12:54] 
[00:12:55] It complicates things.
[00:12:56] And it's just, and again, like where I was doing
[00:12:59] the opposite effect thing,
[00:13:01] where I'm coming in and they're moving back.
[00:13:03] It's like, it just, it wasn't, I don't know.
[00:13:06] I think I, I couldn't have done it honestly
[00:13:09] at the worst time.
[00:13:11] And that's okay, because I feel like it really,
[00:13:16] you go through those obstacles
[00:13:17] and those are what really makes you stronger.
[00:13:19] I think as a person, as an agent,
[00:13:22] I know it's like to have it kind of rough.
[00:13:25] And I honestly think that the time I finally
[00:13:28] actually started really seeing some really great results
[00:13:31] was when I decided to,
[00:13:36] I got asked to join a team with,
[00:13:39] and this team that was leaving their, their brokerage,
[00:13:42] they were going to add properties.
[00:13:43] And I actually knew one of the guys on the team,
[00:13:45] I know them for many, many years back from Napier Bell
[00:13:49] actually, he was a friend.
[00:13:51] And they asked me to join the team.
[00:13:53] I ran with it.
[00:13:55] And ever since that day, I said,
[00:13:57] I will never say no to anything.
[00:14:00] I'm going to hustle.
[00:14:01] I, I will go to St. Charles, Illinois,
[00:14:04] and do whatever I could do.
[00:14:05] I'll go back to Napier Bell.
[00:14:06] I will do whatever I have to do to take leads.
[00:14:08] Like I, and then I also said,
[00:14:10] I will materialize them.
[00:14:11] That was another thing,
[00:14:13] because I had the experience.
[00:14:14] I wasn't a new agent, you know?
[00:14:16] So that was really when,
[00:14:18] when things started to really start working out for me,
[00:14:21] was when I did that,
[00:14:23] I had some camaraderie from the team,
[00:14:25] and it really just, it really felt good.
[00:14:29] What were some of the things that you did
[00:14:31] to help lead generation?
[00:14:33] I know sometimes when you're a team,
[00:14:35] sometimes your fed leads,
[00:14:36] of course, that's one of the nice benefits.
[00:14:38] But also, you know,
[00:14:39] you're generating your own book of business too.
[00:14:41] So how did you,
[00:14:42] how did you do that with not a huge sphere of influence?
[00:14:45] You know, you said,
[00:14:46] pretty much people were like,
[00:14:47] you know, ships in the night,
[00:14:49] you're people you knew were moving the opposite way
[00:14:51] that you were, it's not like you couldn't,
[00:14:52] you wouldn't go out and help them.
[00:14:53] Of course you would,
[00:14:54] but you're not as present in their life at that point.
[00:14:56] Maybe in that, you know, they see,
[00:14:57] it was a city person now, maybe.
[00:14:58] So how did you,
[00:15:00] but you were like, I'm going to go everywhere
[00:15:01] and get all the leads I can because why not?
[00:15:04] And, you know, how did you do that?
[00:15:05] Just out of curiosity.
[00:15:07] Yep. So, okay.
[00:15:09] So yes, not only did I just say yes to leads like when,
[00:15:13] okay, so for example,
[00:15:14] there would be at properties had their app
[00:15:18] that had just come out and I saw that people be like,
[00:15:22] hi, do you want this lead?
[00:15:23] Do you want this lead?
[00:15:24] I'm not kidding.
[00:15:25] I would be sitting here like this,
[00:15:27] waiting until this,
[00:15:28] like, I had, I don't even know if you could have notifications.
[00:15:30] I'm like, hi, Seth, but like I was just like me, me, me,
[00:15:34] and I would give this whole explanation
[00:15:36] how I had been an agent for this money.
[00:15:37] I mean, I took so much time into every explanation.
[00:15:43] I would be all over the Facebook leads.
[00:15:45] Like I would see something come on.
[00:15:47] Hey, I'm a buyer looking for first person.
[00:15:50] I would reach out, then I would DM them,
[00:15:52] then I would message them again.
[00:15:54] Like I was, I was obsessed with it.
[00:15:58] I literally wouldn't leave people alone.
[00:16:00] I mean, but I made sure I did it in a,
[00:16:01] and then I sure was it's, you know,
[00:16:03] that wasn't too overbearing.
[00:16:05] But I was very much responsive and on top of things
[00:16:09] and very consistent.
[00:16:11] And then once I started actually getting some business
[00:16:15] from that, I always kept up with my clients from there.
[00:16:19] I knew that these were probably going to be
[00:16:21] my bread and butter for the future.
[00:16:24] I learned that the hard way from not taking
[00:16:27] anybody over from from neighbor bill.
[00:16:29] All these people I did close, which I had closings
[00:16:33] when I was younger, I didn't follow what.
[00:16:36] That's that was a problem.
[00:16:38] By the way, thank you for, thank you for owning that
[00:16:40] and being vulnerable and admitting that
[00:16:43] because every single person on this call is not perfect.
[00:16:47] And we've all let clients fall by the way side
[00:16:50] and it's something that it's very unfortunate
[00:16:53] and also very relatable and it happens.
[00:16:56] It happens and you know what?
[00:16:58] It's okay.
[00:16:59] And as long as you learn from it eventually
[00:17:04] and then don't do that anymore
[00:17:07] because it's not helping your business
[00:17:08] and then don't bitch that you're not getting any referrals,
[00:17:10] you know.
[00:17:12] But one thing I wanted to say was I really started doing
[00:17:16] a ton of open houses.
[00:17:18] I set open houses for my team all the time.
[00:17:21] Like I mean, sometimes I sat four open houses
[00:17:25] for the same property.
[00:17:26] If my team had a new development
[00:17:28] so I was like oh my gosh, one and a half million dollar
[00:17:32] listing, yes please.
[00:17:33] I'm like I'll do it with just the studs in.
[00:17:36] And I get a lot of money.
[00:17:37] Yeah, exactly, right, of course.
[00:17:39] You know, and like all you need is that one person
[00:17:42] to come by and just maybe say hey look,
[00:17:47] we happen to just be in the neighborhood
[00:17:49] and it's happened.
[00:17:51] So that was a huge way for me to start getting
[00:17:55] business, was doing open houses, helping out with showings,
[00:18:00] getting to know the buildings.
[00:18:01] Oh my gosh, that was huge.
[00:18:04] Like that was a big thing because you didn't have high
[00:18:08] rises and stuff like that out there was only single
[00:18:10] family homes in Naperva, mostly, you know.
[00:18:13] There are agents here in Chicago and in other metropolitan,
[00:18:16] big metropolitan areas that literally make their good chunk
[00:18:20] of their career in one building or two buildings.
[00:18:22] Michael Rosenbloom's done that.
[00:18:24] I've done an interview with him many, many years ago.
[00:18:26] He's King of that.
[00:18:27] There's a number of agents that have done that.
[00:18:30] And so I want to talk about the one that you have done that
[00:18:32] with, which is called the Metropolitan Place.
[00:18:35] It's a high rise here in Chicago.
[00:18:37] But tell us about how you got into that building
[00:18:40] and how you started to develop relationships
[00:18:42] so that you became the agent of choice.
[00:18:47] 100%.
[00:18:48] So I love that building so much, by the way.
[00:18:51] It's like it's just got a part of my heart.
[00:18:53] And the reason why is because that's the home
[00:18:57] that I grew up in.
[00:18:58] And I say that because when I was actually dating somebody
[00:19:04] and they really wanted to move that way
[00:19:06] and I really didn't want to and I pushed back on it
[00:19:10] and he was like, no, we got to move here fine.
[00:19:12] So we end up moving in a metropolitan place
[00:19:15] and it was such a cool city loft.
[00:19:19] It was like something that you just kind of see
[00:19:20] out of the movie or you are something that you have
[00:19:22] like a vision of in your head when you're like younger.
[00:19:25] Like when I was like in 1996 and I was like 12 or 13
[00:19:28] and I'm like, I just could wait my age great.
[00:19:30] Sorry.
[00:19:31] Shoot.
[00:19:32] But in 1996, you know, and you're thinking like,
[00:19:35] oh my god, I want to live in the city in this loft
[00:19:37] and that was what it was basically.
[00:19:40] So I ended up living there for about six and a half years.
[00:19:46] And even though I was a renter in there, I was a renter.
[00:19:50] I was not an owner, nobody knew.
[00:19:54] And so I was like, I know they invited me to,
[00:19:57] okay, so they invited me to all of their community events
[00:20:01] and they're like, oh my gosh, yeah, you're so fun.
[00:20:04] Why don't you be part of the social committee?
[00:20:06] And by the way, we should mention to anyone listening
[00:20:08] that's not normally what they invite renters to do.
[00:20:11] Anything related to the building
[00:20:12] because of course that's for owners
[00:20:15] but they liked you and said, come on by.
[00:20:17] Yeah, they liked me and I was like,
[00:20:19] honestly, really into throwing parties.
[00:20:21] So I was like, hey, let's, we should do this.
[00:20:24] We should bring my amp
[00:20:25] because I like, I used to play music and stuff
[00:20:28] and I had a bunch of different amps and like,
[00:20:30] oh no, we need to like light this party up, you know?
[00:20:32] And so I would like suggest different types of catering
[00:20:36] and music and this and that and come up with all the ideas.
[00:20:40] So they were super intrigued by it
[00:20:41] and it really was bringing the community together.
[00:20:44] And that was really like the biggest step right there
[00:20:47] into that building was just becoming friends
[00:20:49] with a lot of the neighbors.
[00:20:52] And then basically what happened was that boy
[00:20:56] forgot kicked out and then the new one moved in.
[00:21:00] So and then that became my husband actually.
[00:21:03] So my husband, I met him in Metropolitan Place.
[00:21:07] I know.
[00:21:08] His, somebody he worked with, they were my next door neighbor.
[00:21:15] And we basically just kind of like,
[00:21:17] I don't want to say we brand the building,
[00:21:19] but like we were just friends with everybody
[00:21:21] and then I tried making an offer three different times
[00:21:25] with the owner on our place.
[00:21:26] I really wanted to buy it and live there
[00:21:29] and they didn't want to sell it yet
[00:21:30] and they still haven't sold it.
[00:21:31] They're still renting it.
[00:21:32] But after that time, I was like, oh my gosh,
[00:21:35] I need to be in this building somehow
[00:21:38] whether I'm gonna live here later on
[00:21:39] or just sell the shit out of it, you know?
[00:21:42] So I kept in communication with everybody.
[00:21:46] And before you know it, I started getting one listing
[00:21:49] and another listing and another listing and rentals.
[00:21:53] I'll do anything.
[00:21:53] Rental listings, buyers, whatever.
[00:21:56] And I have such a great core connection with them
[00:22:00] and everybody that actually helps within the network
[00:22:02] to like pitch that to other sellers for,
[00:22:06] you know, in case I had like an in-house buyer
[00:22:10] and house listing or whatever,
[00:22:11] it might be ryer pocket listing.
[00:22:13] So I think that I didn't really have to try that hard.
[00:22:19] It really was just about being part of like a lifestyle.
[00:22:23] Really, I kind of just made it my lifestyle
[00:22:25] and that's really how it happened.
[00:22:27] It was super organic.
[00:22:29] But you know, like now I do send out marketing material
[00:22:34] but I don't feel weird doing it
[00:22:37] where I'm like begging or asking for a business.
[00:22:40] I probably shouldn't say like that.
[00:22:41] But I don't feel that I'm asking for a business.
[00:22:43] They already know who I am and every January
[00:22:47] they expect to get this booklet from me
[00:22:49] and it basically states a whole market updated
[00:22:52] the whole year, everything that I've sold
[00:22:54] a little bit about my life, how I met my husband there.
[00:22:58] They have, my dog was born there, you know?
[00:23:01] Like it is.
[00:23:02] Oh, so it's exclusive to the building.
[00:23:05] Just to them only.
[00:23:07] Just to them only.
[00:23:09] And I do happy hours with them too.
[00:23:11] Like I mean, just like literally I will shoot out
[00:23:14] little messages to the building.
[00:23:17] I mean, I know so many people there.
[00:23:18] So I just, I have a personal email and I'll say,
[00:23:20] hey, you want to go do a little happy hour over at the Mariano's
[00:23:24] and lost the loop.
[00:23:25] You know, like that's so funny
[00:23:26] because we were like, it's a grocery store
[00:23:27] but that's actually where we used to go and hang out.
[00:23:30] It's what was like old times, you know?
[00:23:32] And just really easy, simple stuff.
[00:23:35] They still invite me to their community events and stuff.
[00:23:39] It's I'm really lucky.
[00:23:41] Yeah, it looks like it sounds like to me
[00:23:44] that you married kind of your passion to this opportunity.
[00:23:48] It was like, oh, I like doing this.
[00:23:50] I like being of service.
[00:23:51] I like throwing, you know, social events
[00:23:53] and I like being helpful there.
[00:23:55] And so you just, you know, all of those buildings
[00:23:57] are always looking for people to help with those things
[00:23:59] because nobody wants to help.
[00:24:01] I know like the building I'm at,
[00:24:03] I will not be joining the board
[00:24:05] but I also don't complain about anything.
[00:24:07] So I think that's a fair deal.
[00:24:08] I go, thank you for the board, whatever, you know,
[00:24:11] whatever decisions you guys make, I won't complain.
[00:24:13] But I'm also not going to, I'm not going to do my time.
[00:24:15] I've done that before and learned my lesson.
[00:24:18] But, but if I was a practicing agent,
[00:24:20] I would totally be doing that
[00:24:22] because great opportunity to, and I'll give you just
[00:24:25] for anyone listening, you just reminded me of a,
[00:24:29] of a really simple idea that I think a lot of agents forget.
[00:24:33] And I'll give you, use myself as an example.
[00:24:35] So I live in a building called Alcobe, it's in Wicker Park.
[00:24:37] Anyway, our audience won't know what that is.
[00:24:39] But anyway, it's a relatively new development
[00:24:41] like four years old, maybe.
[00:24:43] Three, three to four years old.
[00:24:44] I've lived there since the beginning.
[00:24:45] I can tell you the number of physical marketing materials
[00:24:49] that have shown up in my inbox from other agents.
[00:24:53] Literally, there's 46,000 REALTORS in the Chicago Land Area,
[00:24:56] including the suburbs.
[00:24:58] I have gotten zero, not one in four years.
[00:25:02] And I don't think it's because people know I'm in the business.
[00:25:04] They would be farming everyone in the, in the building.
[00:25:06] So that is a crazy thing to say.
[00:25:10] Like I am shocked.
[00:25:11] Now I understand too, people who move into new construction
[00:25:13] usually don't leave it with three years.
[00:25:15] But it would be a great time to start building a relationship
[00:25:17] with a, with a, with a, you know, a possible future seller.
[00:25:21] At some point, I'm probably going to move out of there and, you know,
[00:25:24] and, and cry because my interest rate is so low and I'm going to lose it.
[00:25:27] But the point is, is, yeah, I've moved.
[00:25:29] People have moved out of our building, who were only there a year or two,
[00:25:33] you know, life got in the way for, or they, whatever, they transfer jobs or something.
[00:25:37] But I am shocked.
[00:25:39] I am still today.
[00:25:40] I've been talking about this for years on my podcast.
[00:25:42] Not one person has ever sent me a piece of mail.
[00:25:45] Is that, that is, so there, we're talking about is really what you were doing
[00:25:49] is you were, obviously, and you still do it.
[00:25:51] You're still putting material together for a building or, oh, yeah.
[00:25:55] For people listening could be a neighborhood, it could be a community, it could be,
[00:25:58] it could be really anything that you're interested in.
[00:26:01] But just to give people an idea that if you think all of,
[00:26:04] all of these places are being farmed, my building has not been farmed once.
[00:26:09] And we are, we are a building that should be farmed because we have some good,
[00:26:13] good sellers in there that, that, you know, have some high priced places.
[00:26:17] So it's, it's shocking to me, but that's how much opportunity there is.
[00:26:21] Yeah, it is crazy, right?
[00:26:22] Yeah.
[00:26:22] So you could become the alkova person if you want to.
[00:26:26] I know.
[00:26:27] I'm like, just wait till you see next month in your mail.
[00:26:30] It'll be yeah.
[00:26:31] 
[00:26:31] No, but, but I love that.
[00:26:32] So this idea of just staying top of mind with this, that, with that building that you're
[00:26:37] with and being still being a part of it.
[00:26:39] And also, you know, continuing to add value by sending out, by, by putting those
[00:26:43] booklets together for that, I mean, that's, that's a wonderful thing.
[00:26:47] Yeah.
[00:26:48] For four years, too.
[00:26:49] It's been consistent.
[00:26:50] Like just something to the viewers really quick that are maybe even like new reagents and stuff.
[00:26:54] I know some people like feel like, oh, I did mailers for like six months or years.
[00:26:59] Right.
[00:26:59] 
[00:27:00] That's, that's not going to work.
[00:27:02] You might get lucky.
[00:27:02] I don't know.
[00:27:03] I never did, but I can tell you what, I, after four years in a row, I've been gone from that building.
[00:27:09] This, I've been in, in four years.
[00:27:11] I, I haven't stopped once.
[00:27:13] Like, every single month they do get a mailer.
[00:27:16] And at every single January, if the last four years or five maybe even, they get the booklet.
[00:27:22] So it's, it's consistency.
[00:27:25] And what I love about that is it's, it, it, every, every 30 days.
[00:27:31] And whether they just look at the, you know, the postcard or thing, of course, yeah.
[00:27:36] And that's, that's okay.
[00:27:37] We don't even care if they, of course they're going to throw it out.
[00:27:39] But at least they're going to see your picture and your name before they throw it out, right?
[00:27:43] It's like, oh, there's the thing of GSMG.
[00:27:45] Okay, cool.
[00:27:46] And they toss it.
[00:27:47] But they see you and they remember, they reminded, they're reminded of what you are,
[00:27:51] or what you do and who you are.
[00:27:52] So I think it is a great, great idea.
[00:27:56] And I'm shocked that more agents aren't doing that.
[00:27:58] I know doing mailers is expensive and it also maybe seems a bit antiquated.
[00:28:03] But I'm telling you, people aren't reading their emails.
[00:28:05] That's the other thing I would love to do a podcast called Nobody reads your emails
[00:28:09] because nobody reads their emails because nobody does.
[00:28:12] Nobody does.
[00:28:13] It's either text message or physical mail.
[00:28:15] Those are the only things that are actually consistently getting looked at.
[00:28:19] And even text messages goofy now because, you know, people,
[00:28:24] there's all sorts of spam on text messages a little harder to do.
[00:28:27] But, but yeah, so I love that.
[00:28:29] And it works, but you're right.
[00:28:30] You have to do it for, for at least a couple of years.
[00:28:34] For a real, yeah.
[00:28:35] And you have to be willing just to eat the cost for a bit and realize maybe one transaction
[00:28:39] is going to pay for the year anyway.
[00:28:42] Exactly.
[00:28:43] Exactly.
[00:28:44] That's the kind of mindset you have to have.
[00:28:46] You just have to kind of go with it.
[00:28:47] You know, and if you don't want to pay for that all by yourself on
[00:28:54] monthly or whatever, maybe there are options out there that you can work out with,
[00:28:58] maybe partnering with one of your lenders and seeing if they'd be willing to split the cost too.
[00:29:09] Yeah.
[00:29:09] Just sort of your sense, this is something I don't ever talk about.
[00:29:14] And I think it's a fun thing to talk about is you are somebody who I suspect is often told
[00:29:20] how great your fashion sense is.
[00:29:23] You have your very intentional about your dress.
[00:29:25] You have a really unique style that is very cool, at least, you know, to me and not a lot of
[00:29:31] other people say the same thing about you.
[00:29:33] How much fun is it to sort of marry your style of, you know,
[00:29:38] sort of dress with work?
[00:29:41] Like it seems like that's something that you really truly enjoy.
[00:29:44] Oh my gosh.
[00:29:45] This is like the best question ever.
[00:29:48] So I love fashion so much.
[00:29:51] Yes, I used to watch the 1990, 1991.
[00:29:56] I used to watch all of the Donna Karen and DeCan why runway models.
[00:30:02] Like I was like obsessed.
[00:30:03] I mean, I would be like sitting in even Marcus just like waiting for my mom in the dressing room while
[00:30:09] she was like just trying on clothes forever.
[00:30:11] And I didn't at mine.
[00:30:12] I would just like look at everything.
[00:30:14] I just, I am obsessed with fashion.
[00:30:17] My favorite color is leopard by the way.
[00:30:19] I know, right?
[00:30:21] 
[00:30:21] Yeah.
[00:30:22] But no, I gotta say this like, I feel like that's one thing that might maybe like actually be
[00:30:29] something unique that might stop me aside from 100%.
[00:30:32] Some other agents.
[00:30:34] I'm not really the most typical dressing looking agent.
[00:30:41] I am, I am very professional.
[00:30:44] But I believe in being just yourself and I love colors.
[00:30:50] I love colors.
[00:30:52] I like black.
[00:30:52] I love jewelry.
[00:30:54] I love hair.
[00:30:55] I'm big into red lipstick.
[00:30:57] I just love having a very eclectic look.
[00:31:01] And I think that you can have an edgy eclectic look
[00:31:06] being in a professional setting still.
[00:31:10] And you don't have to just wear, you know, just to suit all the time or just to dress all the time.
[00:31:17] I think there is a way to still have your fashion sense and your style
[00:31:24] and incorporate that into your showings or whatever it may be.
[00:31:29] Yeah, I think it really works for you too because it definitely feels authentic to you.
[00:31:34] Right? So when I've seen you in person, I'm like, oh yeah, that she's very intentional about her
[00:31:39] dress. It's very cool. It's unique.
[00:31:41] And probably it's part of your brand.
[00:31:43] And I think there's nothing inherently negative about that.
[00:31:46] I know sometimes people want to, you know, obviously your professionalism, your skill level,
[00:31:50] all of the things you do are really the most important part.
[00:31:53] But it's nice to have a really intentional aesthetic.
[00:31:56] And you do. And I think that that's something that a lot of agents could really think about
[00:32:01] what is my aesthetic, even if it's maybe if it's more conservative, more, more, you know, more edgy,
[00:32:07] whatever it might be, you know, really be intentional about that.
[00:32:10] People remember how people are dressed. I mean, they really do.
[00:32:13] I want to go back all the way back to you at the beginning you talked about really wanting to
[00:32:19] become a tennis pro. And I just got back from, well, not just, but a few months ago, I went to the
[00:32:24] US Open out in out in flushing. Yeah. So it was my second year in a row going. Yeah, so much fun.
[00:32:30] So, and that was, yeah, it's, by the way, if anyone ever has an opportunity to go out to the US
[00:32:36] Open, if you're in New York, you've probably already done that if you live there. But if you haven't,
[00:32:40] it's a great opportunity to really see some, some wonderful tennis and just got to get a sense of,
[00:32:45] of what that, the US Open really is, which is really a lot of fun. But I'm curious about when you were
[00:32:50] playing, I'm a tennis player as well. But when you were, when you started in tennis and you really
[00:32:54] were going to make this your career, it's a tremendous amount of discipline like any other sport.
[00:32:58] So can you talk a little bit about the amount of work that you were putting into it and did that
[00:33:02] translate over into once you were, you know, a real estate agent, did those skills kind of transfer over?
[00:33:09] Yeah. So that is a whole other part of my life. It basically was my life. The whole
[00:33:17] first probably at least the first 15 to 17 years of my life. Yeah. So basically I was a UST
[00:33:24] tennis player, a UST junior national tennis player. I, from the time I remember since I was about,
[00:33:31] maybe like six years old, well I started when I was about four. But when I was probably about six
[00:33:37] or seven is when things had to really get serious. Like I literally was sat down by my parents.
[00:33:42] I have, I have the European tennis parents, my dad's from Hungary, my mom's from Italy. So,
[00:33:46] you know, they have the dreams, right? And they call them America. It's like, okay, we have our
[00:33:50] taunt, or maybe we should be a tennis pro. I don't know. But basically, I had to have a very
[00:33:56] serious talk with them. And I was about six and a half. I remember I was in a car with them and
[00:34:02] they're like, you have to choose. You want tennis or you want to be a figure skater because I was
[00:34:06] doing both. And I chose tennis. So, ever since six and a half, I, I basically just trained every
[00:34:14] single day. And I was always going after school. I was picked up straight to tennis. I'd get a
[00:34:23] ten, a private tennis lesson. And then I would, I would have a group tennis training, which would
[00:34:28] usually be around anywhere from like an hour private to like three hours of training afterwards.
[00:34:34] It was pretty consistent like that all the way up until high school. When you become like 12 or 13,
[00:34:41] it's really when it's like serious. And my parents wanted to send me to the to the
[00:34:45] to the Voltairee. Sure. Down in Florida. Yeah. And it was a little scary because I was 12 when I had
[00:34:53] another serious talk with them. And they really wanted to take, they really wanted to take it to another
[00:34:58] level. I was, you know, nationally ranked. It was, it was one of those things were, you either just
[00:35:07] do it full time at that point. You know, you shut off everything else in your life and you just go
[00:35:12] for it. I wasn't ready to do it. I was really, I cried a lot about it. I didn't want to do it. I
[00:35:18] didn't want to leave my parents. Like I was, I don't even know, but it was my friends as much. I just
[00:35:28] like a big ask to big ask. It's just a big ask and like, you know, but I, but here's the thing.
[00:35:36] I, it really brought so much routine and discipline to my life now. And you ask like, how do I apply it
[00:35:44] to or how have I applied it to my real estate life? And you know, my biggest, my biggest thing that
[00:35:50] I think that I am, that I have a strength in is my, my wellness routine. I've always been into
[00:35:57] working out. I mean, I used to have a personal trainer at the age of eight. I don't know if people
[00:36:03] would frown upon that now, but back then, if people really did it, whatever. So I, I had a personal
[00:36:10] trainer. I was consistently always working out, always eating healthy. I mean, I was always
[00:36:16] thinking about what I had to eat. And it was, it's, it hasn't changed, honestly. And now, I think
[00:36:24] the fact that I'm able to wake up early in the morning and I can get things done, I have a
[00:36:31] schedule. I, I still love to work out. It helps to stress me. And I, I love being a coach for my
[00:36:39] team. I, I've been coached my whole life. And I, I don't know, I think that it just really helps,
[00:36:47] but also with, with when I'm with my clients, I mean, I love being super competitive for them.
[00:36:53] If we're going into a multiple offer situation or maybe not even a multiple offer, just knowing
[00:36:58] that there's a hot property and they want it, like, I want to get it for them. So it's, it's almost like,
[00:37:04] to me, I look at it as, it's like a match every time I'm, I'm going out into the field with them.
[00:37:10] I want to do the best I can for them. And I'm, I'm sure that's got to do with something with
[00:37:15] how I play tennis. Well, yeah, you, you just have, you had to do a lot of activity. You had to be
[00:37:20] intentional about your, your food and your, and your schedule and, you know, your exercise. And
[00:37:26] all of that is, is just being really, and setting up an intentional kind of life where you're like,
[00:37:31] this is what I do. And maybe it was done for you when you were little because that's, you know,
[00:37:35] that's how it works. But as an adult, you know, it's, I think a lot of us could benefit from
[00:37:40] really thinking about building it, it's sort of like letting things happen and, and just kind of
[00:37:46] going, well, I should do this. I should do that. It's like literally sitting down and saying,
[00:37:51] let's design my, my diet or let's design my, my health regimen or let's design my marketing
[00:37:56] practice for finding new clients and not just kind of flying by the emails that come in and
[00:38:02] responding to text messages and all of the sort of what we need to deal with that's right in front
[00:38:07] of us that can feel really productive and technically is productive for our existing clients and
[00:38:12] whatever is urgent in the moment. But this idea of planning in advance, I mean, you talked about
[00:38:17] like nutrition, like for me, I figured this out many years ago that maybe it's just me and other
[00:38:23] people wouldn't struggle as much with this. But I realized if I didn't plan my lunch before I
[00:38:28] left for the day, if I didn't bring a lunch or plan my lunch, I was going to make a bad decision
[00:38:33] for lunch. So I was, I was literally going to make an unhealthy decision. And so I'm like, well,
[00:38:38] I can't trust myself to make a good health decision in the moment because I might be stressed out,
[00:38:43] I might be wanting to escape, I might be just feeling crummy, whatever. And you know, fast food
[00:38:47] looks pretty good when you're stressed out. So I, and I, and you know, so what I do is I plan my
[00:38:54] meals out, I batch cook, I do those things, not because I'm like so brilliant, it's because I have
[00:38:59] such a weak, you know, self control. And so I think that's part of it too is thinking about like,
[00:39:05] what are you good at? What aren't you good at? And you know, because for you lifestyle is everything.
[00:39:10] So you are intentional about yourself, but I'm sure there's parts of your business that you
[00:39:14] aren't good at or that you don't enjoy doing. And can you talk about sort of how you get through
[00:39:20] those tasks or do you delegate or do you, you know, team members help? So what are, what are the
[00:39:24] things that about, because everyone has parts of their business if they're doing it all themselves,
[00:39:28] that they're like, I'm not good at it. I don't like it. I mean, honestly, that's to me, like, that's
[00:39:33] one of the biggest things to realize in order to become a successful agent, you do need to realize
[00:39:37] what you don't love to do in your business and you do need to realize what your strengths are in
[00:39:42] your business, what you like to do. Because if you are doing those things that you don't love,
[00:39:46] all the time, you're going to get burnt out. And some of those things for me were a lot of the
[00:39:52] paperwork. I really wasn't enjoying to do those anymore because as your business grows and you
[00:39:57] now have, you know, eight to 10 to 12 to 14 to 15 listings and then buyers, and now you're like,
[00:40:03] okay, this is a lot of stuff to do. And you're not able to give your clients as great of service
[00:40:09] because you're thinking about how you have to upload disclosures, you know, to your deal management
[00:40:14] system or whatever it is. So one of those things that I decided to do a few years ago was I decided
[00:40:19] to hire a transaction manager. And it's literally, that's changed my life. So that has been a huge
[00:40:27] thing for me as far as getting things organized on that end. And then,
[00:40:32] I did you, sorry. And then for my team, with them, they've been helping me a lot on my showing.
[00:40:41] So for a lot of my listings, they do assist me on being at those showings. I try to have an
[00:40:47] agent at every single showing for my listings. Obviously, things do come up, right? In our
[00:40:56] community, we have somebody always at the showings open houses. I'll be very real with you. I
[00:41:00] did not love doing open houses. I really don't. And I think that after putting in a little over
[00:41:06] 17 years, I think that I kind of get to say if I want to do an open house or not, really, or if I
[00:41:12] feel like it. And just telling you no, I always set my client's expectations with this. And if
[00:41:17] someone really wants me to be at an open house, of course, we'll do it for them. But my agents are
[00:41:24] amazing. And they are very hungry to do open houses. And they do them all the time. So I usually
[00:41:31] have them do my open houses for my listings. So I think those are two, those are probably two,
[00:41:37] I think of my biggest things right there are really the transaction management side and open
[00:41:43] houses. Yeah, transaction management is interesting because it, you know, for a good transaction
[00:41:48] coordinator, just for even one transaction, you can hire people to do individual deals. It's
[00:41:54] pretty affordable, I found it's like usually on 500 bucks or less, and you only pay for closes.
[00:42:00] And yeah, you know, the quality can vary depending on who you get, but you can find some decent
[00:42:04] people eventually. You have somebody you hire somebody and they're, you know, they're your
[00:42:09] person and that's even better. And the other thing I wanted to also mention is these open houses.
[00:42:14] So, you know, it's funny because, you know, you talk about your top producer, you're busy,
[00:42:20] and open houses take time and there's just a lot to do with them. And you've been doing them for 17
[00:42:24] years. You're like, okay, you know, maybe it's maybe I can offload or delegate those to some of my
[00:42:29] team members because they're the ones that probably need leads more than even I do for, which is
[00:42:34] really what open houses, you know, quite frankly do more than anything is hopefully provide some
[00:42:38] buyer leads, hopefully for that property, but probably for any property because they're people
[00:42:43] walking in. So this is something that if I were an agent and I were in your office and I didn't
[00:42:48] have any listings, I would be begging and pleading with you, please, please, please let me do an
[00:42:53] open house. And, you know, I'd probably have to earn that the right for you to say, okay, you can do one.
[00:42:59] And it's something that I want all of our listeners to consider doing. If there's anyone in your
[00:43:03] office with a listing, beg and plead with them to help, you know, help you, you know, set up an
[00:43:08] open house and, you know, see, because it's going to help them to the owner, the owner's going to
[00:43:12] think they're doing something great for their property. It's going to help you as the agent because
[00:43:17] you're going to learn how to talk to people about real estate and about a particular property. And,
[00:43:21] and also it's, yeah, it's just a great way to get leads. So I'm, I think that's awesome. I think
[00:43:27] that's fantastic and, and, you know, begging and you were talking about this when you joined a team,
[00:43:32] you were like, I was doing a lot of open houses because the team had listed. All the time. Yeah.
[00:43:36] All the time. It was just, and it was just such a good way to, to be able to,
[00:43:41] honestly, to, to feel busy, like, you know, especially as being a new agent, it's like,
[00:43:47] I don't know, I just feel like I loved filling up my weekends with having all of this to do.
[00:43:52] And then I, at the same time, I remember thinking, wait, I'm also learning how to do this,
[00:43:57] even better and learning these buildings, like going up and down some of these high
[00:44:01] rises, like I now know where the amenities are. I know where this is. I, and you're, and you're
[00:44:05] practicing saying your spiel. I mean, there's a lot to say when you're walking into a condor,
[00:44:10] if you were asking questions about reserves and this and that, you know, it's like you,
[00:44:15] you, it's, it's all practice. Yeah. So I think it's a great way for you to be able to practice
[00:44:21] because they don't teach you this stuff in real estate school. Yeah. Yeah. So everyone listening,
[00:44:26] open houses still work. They are super effective and they, you know, you, you have to do a lot of
[00:44:32] them though. You don't do one and expect, you know, five buyers to walk in. They may or may not,
[00:44:37] but you do 100 open houses next year or that's probably too many to do. But if you do 50 or more,
[00:44:43] you'll, you'll, you'll find clients that way. So ask the, ask your managing broker or
[00:44:48] top agents in your office. What you could do to earn an opportunity to do an open house.
[00:44:53] And I know a lot of top agents will say when people ask them the first time, they'll say, no,
[00:44:57] they'll go, um, I don't know you well enough yet. Thank you. And I'll keep you in mind. And they
[00:45:03] want to see if they come back or they want to see how hungry they really are. And then, you know,
[00:45:07] that, that can also happen too. So even if you get a no, you know, I, I would, my next question
[00:45:11] would be, could I ever earn a place to do this? Is there something I could do to really prove
[00:45:16] you that I would be a great fit for this particular listing? Because I want to help your,
[00:45:20] your seller sell this property. And, you know, so there's all of those things. So yes, make that a big
[00:45:25] play for 2025. Anyone out there who is struggling with listings and right now it's tough to have
[00:45:29] to get listings. Let's talk about the current, the current climate right now. We have interest rates
[00:45:34] which are, are better than they were recently, but they're still a little higher than probably anyone
[00:45:38] would want where I don't think we're getting back down to the 3% days anytime soon, if ever.
[00:45:43] But we still have a lot of people locked into that 3% who purchased years ago. So it's, it's a tricky
[00:45:49] situation for, for sellers right now because they might not want to sell strictly because of that
[00:45:54] interest rate. So curious if that's coming up for you a lot when you meet with sellers.
[00:46:00] Does that seem to be, to impact, I, and I just don't know because I'm not out there doing it.
[00:46:04] Yeah, you know, I mean, I just think it kind of like varies. I do, I mean, I am starting to see
[00:46:12] people wanting to just sell their homes and they do have that 2 and a half for 3% and they're like,
[00:46:18] we just have to move. Yeah, you have to move too small. Like, I mean, we're coming up to what,
[00:46:23] it's been since 2021 and 2020, it's almost been four years, right? So like people are,
[00:46:30] they have so many different situations. Their families are going really get a job or whatever,
[00:46:35] maybe a lot happens even in two years. So, you know, we're just seeing a lot of different things happen.
[00:46:41] I'm really excited to see what's going to happen in the beginning of next year. I mean,
[00:46:45] we keep hearing all these different things, right? I'm hearing, I don't know about you, DJ, but like,
[00:46:48] I'm hearing like five and a half percent sometime next quarter. Let's hope. That'd be nice.
[00:46:54] And I think even I even think six and a half is reasonable. I mean, it's not a fun number compared to,
[00:47:00] but anyway, I also wanted to just ask about, you know, working with buyers these days because as we know
[00:47:06] with the NAR settlement, things have changed. We now set up our own commission structure directly
[00:47:10] with our client as opposed to, you know, a coupling the commission as was done before.
[00:47:16] Has that changed anything for you? Is it basically still business as usual? Or are you finding that
[00:47:23] those conversations are more challenging? Are they about the same? Just curious on how that's
[00:47:29] affected your business? You know, it's funny is that like, I have never done a four-sale by owner
[00:47:36] before my whole life. And literally, I think it was like August,
[00:47:42] four to the 15 maybe, whatever, it was like a week or something after the summer was August 17th.
[00:47:46] Was that any I think when it got, when it took effect? And I had a buyer and he liked this condo
[00:47:53] and it happened to be a fizzbo. And like, basically, I, he wasn't going to pay out a commission,
[00:47:59] but I called that seller. It was the easiest conversation. I'm like, hey, this is going to be the
[00:48:06] commission. I'll, what do you want to net? And that was kind of our conversation. That's how
[00:48:10] we really started it. And he was like, this, X amount of dollars, I go, great. So if we do X,
[00:48:15] can we, can I have X? And he was like, that sounds like a great deal to me. And I'm like, okay,
[00:48:20] cool. So I mean, I don't know. And that's a, that's a fizzbo. That's a fizzbo. And that's a fizzbo. So
[00:48:25] like, that was a really great way for me to like, just start off right off the bat. Like with,
[00:48:31] I gave him the broker compensation agreement. I had the talk with the buyer. I mean, everybody was
[00:48:35] fine and happy. And it worked out great. So that was, I think just like after that, I had,
[00:48:42] I don't know, I just had like confidence going into it. And also, I don't know, I don't,
[00:48:47] I didn't really find this as a big of a deal as maybe some people did. Like in my head, I just
[00:48:51] think it's just what the seller is going to net. So as long as we could come up with that,
[00:48:56] that number. And if you're an agent that's able to have that conversation with your seller or your
[00:49:02] buyer, it really shouldn't be that much of an issue. It's really, we're just being more transparent.
[00:49:08] Now we are being transparent now. That's all it is. Yeah, I think it's, it's buyers were always
[00:49:14] paying commissions. They just didn't know it. Yeah. It was invisible. It was, it wasn't a check they
[00:49:20] physically wrote out. It was part of the whole number. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So that's, that's good to know.
[00:49:26] And then I wanted to also ask, you know, you have your building this team, are you looking for more
[00:49:31] team members? Are you looking to grow your team? You know, sort of, or you like, this is what I,
[00:49:36] because I have people on the show who are like, I do not want any more people. This is all I can
[00:49:39] handle. And then of course, people are, are looking to grow. But what do you see for yourself for,
[00:49:43] for your team? Wow. I don't have a crystal ball, but I, I would love, I would love to be able to
[00:49:54] grow my team to maybe one other agent. I don't want to have a very big team at all. Excuse me.
[00:50:01] I, but I am looking for a, a, a really solid agent that has had some years of experience. So if
[00:50:13] you're free to reach out, but I am looking for one, for one more team, so I would love to have maybe
[00:50:19] the max of between four and five people on my team. And I, I would not go any further than that.
[00:50:24] That's awesome. So for anyone out there who is in the Chicagoland area and wants to partner with
[00:50:28] the top producer and thinks they could be a value to Gia, you know, reach out to her. Also, if you are
[00:50:34] in a market where people from Chicago move to, maybe they retire or have a second home or vacation
[00:50:39] home, that is also a person to connect with. Gia, she would love to chat with you and also people
[00:50:44] move into Chicago from other markets as well. So if you're one of our listeners from anywhere in the
[00:50:50] country and you think, Oh, I sometimes have people to refer to in Chicago or I'd like to develop a
[00:50:55] relationship with Gia because she probably has clients that move out near me. That would be an
[00:50:59] awesome reason to reach out and see if you guys have some synergies together. And also once you
[00:51:04] everybody to follow Gia on her, it, how an Instagram, which is Gia Chicago, I will have a link to
[00:51:11] that in the show notes. Oh, one last question for you. And I think this is always a fun one for,
[00:51:18] for our listeners is what was a miss, what was a mistake that you made early on in your real estate
[00:51:24] career that if you could go back and change it, I obviously can't. But if you could, you like,
[00:51:28] I really didn't do that thing correctly. So is there anything that comes to mind that was like a big,
[00:51:33] a big sort of, oof, that one didn't work or maybe you lost a big client or something, you know,
[00:51:38] something like that? There's so many different things, right? I feel like that's how you become
[00:51:46] successful. You fail so many times. But so many different things. I think, I think honestly,
[00:51:52] my biggest thing was I'm just not following up with clients when I was, when I was, when I was an
[00:51:57] agent in the earlier years, I really feel like that was something that I think about a lot,
[00:52:04] where I just thought, gosh, if I only had a CRM, like I really do, like if I had that,
[00:52:11] I feel like things would be even different. And then I guess honestly, just to piggyback on
[00:52:17] that really quick, I wish I moved to the city a little bit sooner. I wish I wish I wish I wish I
[00:52:23] came a city agent when I was like 26 or 27 because I just feel like that this is where
[00:52:29] this was, I don't know, it's just like a better fit than I, I don't know, it was just more real
[00:52:35] or something for me. So I'm hearing, listen to your intuition and intuition is almost never
[00:52:44] steered me wrong. If I can identify what's true intuition and what's like fear or other things.
[00:52:50] So if I can kind of separate those out and go, oh, that's intuition telling me to move to the city
[00:52:54] or whatever, it usually turns out in the right way. And then, you know, the other thing of following
[00:52:59] up, following up, by the way, you know, you sort of like, well, I guess it's following up. That's
[00:53:03] everybody's biggest, biggest challenge in this business. So, so let's all remember follow,
[00:53:08] follow, follow, follow up once the home is sold or the person moves into an apartment. Let's not
[00:53:12] lose, lose touch with them because of course those people will need you in the future, especially
[00:53:17] renters. I mean, anyone renting, even if you didn't do the rental, you should have in your calendar
[00:53:22] when that lease is going to come do and maybe three months ahead of time or four months be like, hey,
[00:53:28] I know your lease is coming due. Let's talk about maybe what you want, what, what some options for
[00:53:32] for going for. Yeah. And you've gotten a lot of business doing that. You know, you've worked with
[00:53:37] renters who took the transition into buyers. Well, anyone out there who is interested in working
[00:53:42] directly with Gia, maybe your local Chicago agent, reach out to her. We will have all of her
[00:53:47] contact information in her show notes. And again, if you're somebody who's in a different market,
[00:53:51] but have people coming and going from the Chicago area and Gia does city and suburbs. She is,
[00:53:56] she is everywhere. So just reach out to her and also maybe you can develop a nice relationship
[00:54:02] there. Gia, I am so grateful for your time today. You were fantastic. Really enjoy having you on
[00:54:09] the day and also just your positivity and sort of joy sort of seems to come through and maybe that
[00:54:15] isn't the perfect word for me. But I've got what's coming to my mind is joy. You have a lot of joy.
[00:54:20] And I think that that really goes a long way when things get hard is like still having this like,
[00:54:26] I mean, I can make this work. I can figure this out. And failing, failing constantly. I'm the same
[00:54:32] way. I do have a different type of position here in the industry, but I fail way more than I succeed.
[00:54:39] Way more. And that's that's kind of the secret to my success as well. It's just fail as much as
[00:54:45] you can and learn like you were saying at the beginning. Yes. And make different choices, of course,
[00:54:49] in the future. All right. Gia, well, we are so grateful on behalf of our audience. For your time
[00:54:54] today, you're amazing. We're so thrilled to continue to watch your team build and your production
[00:55:00] grow. And also on behalf of Gia and myself, want to thank our listeners and viewers for sticking

Thank you so much for having me DJ. I really appreciate the invite and excited to be here. Well, I learned about you at an event, which was like a month or a month or two ago at an A&N mortgage and they had you speak on a panel and you were so outstanding. I was like, I got to get I have to get you on our podcast. So welcome. We're excited to have you and I'm just excited to have another local Chicago person on who I have. I don't have a lot of Chicago people on these days. So this is really fun for me and our listeners are going to really appreciate what you have to talk about. But let's let's start with your story. So how and why did you get into real estate? Sure. Well, it was a long, long time ago DJ. Okay, so basically it really was a long time ago on I was 20. I was honestly around like 2021 years old. And my father was getting into flipping properties. So essentially he was an investor and he kept nudging me to get my real estate license and honestly it really did not sound that desirable to me at the time I was a little bit young, possibly a bit immature. What a 21 year old who's immature. That's impossible. I know right. So it's crazy. So like so I'm I didn't go to I didn't go to college and I was aspiring to be a tennis player right. Yeah. But I knew that you know I had to have some other options out there and my dad did keep kind of dangling the carrot and saying, hey, look, I'm starting to purchase a lot of properties. It'd be so cool as my daughter to be the listing agent. And like I could really get you into this and we really started off on the investor side of things. So before I actually got licensed, I actually used to be a almost like a photographer for my dad, but a different kind of photographer, not the one that goes and takes beautiful pictures of homes. It was a little bit different because these were for share of sales and my dad used to take me to the options and we used to bid on properties and this is right back in 2006. So I'm sure you know where this might be going. Yeah. The good old recession. So I agreed to get my license in 2006. Finally, I did. And as it happened, the market crashed and I was about 22 years old and it was, it was unexplainable to me, meaning as I just didn't understand how to navigate it. I was so young. What do I do now? Yeah. Totally. It was like, what do I do now? And it was interesting to say the least. So I started off in the industry like that. I was actually a suburb agent in Naperville. I did a lot of the western suburbs. I did a lot of the southern suburbs as well. And you know, it was just a whole different market than where I am right now. But I will say this. I did learn a lot. My parents always said to me, if you can stick this out, Jeeha, how many years it will be. I never predicted how many years that recession was going to be. A lot of tears were shed. But it was definitely one of those things that I'm really grateful that I listened to my parents and I stuck through it. And they're like, if you do this, you will come out on top. But you know, I do believe that because of the recession and the age I was at getting into it. It kind of, I don't want to say it like set me back a little bit, but I feel like my career didn't really get started until I came to the city, which was like in 2000 and almost 13. So you basically did like almost a reverse move, right? A lot of people here in Chicago, they, they're here in the city and in their early 20s. They have city life. They love it. And then like, I want to go have more space and be out in the burbs. And I think it's certainly the flight out there. And I like that you did the reverse flight because I'm a city person as well. So I very much appreciate that. And do you do enjoy selling more? And again, I know you sell not just in the city. Of course, you go where your clients need you do prefer to sell not that ones better than the other. But is it more fun to sell in the suburbs in the city? What do you like to do? Yeah, I mean, like I'll be honest, like it's so fast paced out here in the city. This was always my my vibe. When I was, I had a wonderful managing broker who was like, who was my, my mentor at Ryan Hill Realty. It was called back in Napier Bell. And he always said to me, gee, what are you doing? Yeah, yeah. And I was like, I'm a city man. You need to be in the city or city girl. And I'm like, Jack, I'm old. Like I'm at the time of be like 27. You know, like everyone's so I know I know and that I look back and I'm like, what am I thinking but it's just like, you know, I you see all these people that are starting to move back a like 29.30.31.32. Have kids. And I just really didn't think that I don't know. I doubted myself, honestly. and I got to the city, super fast pace. I loved it. These past 10, 11, 12 years, whatever it's been, have been amazing. And, but I will say this, I do not mind going to the suburbs and pulling into a driveway. And I love it. Yeah. Like, you know, like the rides are kind of meditative. And so I don't mind doing that at all, but I think if I was to pick one market over the other, yes, I would, I'm going to be a city agent all the way as long as I can tell, but I'm, as long as it future holds. Yeah, I feel the same way. I'm a city living, I've been living here for almost 20, I think 24, 25 years in the city. And I'm certainly open to moving wherever I ever have to, but I prefer the city. But there's a funny thing that people who don't live in the city of Chicago wouldn't know is that people who live in the city, especially women have this even, I think, more so than men, obviously, is this like, there's always a little bit of like, a little bit of fear and a little bit of danger. We live in Chicago. We always have that. And I live in Wicker Park, you're in Avondale, both nice areas. And there's always still a little bit of like, looking over my shoulder at night. But it is a lot of fun and there's a lot to do. And, you know, I just walked outside on the Milwaukee this weekend and went to a comedy show, like 10 steps before I live, you know, so you can't really beat that. But I do love pulling into a driveway when I visit my friends as well and say, oh, this is what a home looks like. I keep forgetting what real homes look like. Yeah. But let's talk about making that transition from the suburbs to the city because it doesn't necessarily mean that your clients are also moving into the city. Or, you know, those are kind of, could be two sort of separate worlds, obviously, people who live in the suburbs, no people who live in the city, but was that a difficult transition just to find clientele when he moved in? It was honestly just like probably one of the hardest times of my life. On, I, yeah, because I didn't have any clientele in the city, I really didn't. And like, I was, I was honestly, I was going through a breakup and it was like a really long-term relationship. And I kind of like just, I like broke my lease early from, I was living in Lyle and like, broke up with my boyfriend, then broke my lease. And my, my, my managing broker, I was talking about this as I met her, encouraged me, like, go now. So I did. And I literally didn't have anything to bring with me. And I'll be real with you. I did not have like a savvy CRM from, and in a lot of us, I think, didn't either at that time really, like things were just a lot different than they were. I was, was Instagram around. I think it was, but it was like, barely, for being artsy, which, you know, I would post like cool pictures, right? But, right. So, you know, I think, yes, sorry, I like to really talk a lot, but yes, you're so, you're so nailed it on the high. Like it, it was difficult. It was so hard for me. I struggled. I was, I was honestly, I was really broke. I had to learn the hard way. And it really, it really took a while for me to be able to get my feet on the ground with things. I had to make literally all new friends. I had some friends that were from my high school that still live in the city, but, you know, I was going through that breakup, and that breakup was actually a friend from my high school. Oh, no. So, I lost a lot of front. Yeah, you know, that complicates things. It complicates things. And it's just, and again, like where I was doing the opposite effect thing, where I'm coming in and they're moving back. It's like, it just, it wasn't, I don't know. I think I, I couldn't have done it honestly at the worst time. And that's okay, because I feel like it really, you go through those obstacles and those are what really makes you stronger. I think as a person, as an agent, I know it's like to have it kind of rough. And I honestly think that the time I finally actually started really seeing some really great results was when I decided to, I got asked to join a team with, and this team that was leaving their, their brokerage, they were going to add properties. And I actually knew one of the guys on the team, I know them for many, many years back from Napier Bell actually, he was a friend. And they asked me to join the team. I ran with it. And ever since that day, I said, I will never say no to anything. I'm going to hustle. I, I will go to St. Charles, Illinois, and do whatever I could do. I'll go back to Napier Bell. I will do whatever I have to do to take leads. Like I, and then I also said, I will materialize them. That was another thing, because I had the experience. I wasn't a new agent, you know? So that was really when, when things started to really start working out for me, was when I did that, I had some camaraderie from the team, and it really just, it really felt good. What were some of the things that you did to help lead generation? I know sometimes when you're a team, sometimes your fed leads, of course, that's one of the nice benefits. But also, you know, you're generating your own book of business too. So how did you, how did you do that with not a huge sphere of influence? You know, you said, pretty much people were like, you know, ships in the night, you're people you knew were moving the opposite way that you were, it's not like you couldn't, you wouldn't go out and help them. Of course you would, but you're not as present in their life at that point. Maybe in that, you know, they see, it was a city person now, maybe. So how did you, but you were like, I'm going to go everywhere and get all the leads I can because why not? And, you know, how did you do that? Just out of curiosity. Yep. So, okay. So yes, not only did I just say yes to leads like when, okay, so for example, there would be at properties had their app that had just come out and I saw that people be like, hi, do you want this lead? Do you want this lead? I'm not kidding. I would be sitting here like this, waiting until this, like, I had, I don't even know if you could have notifications. I'm like, hi, Seth, but like I was just like me, me, me, and I would give this whole explanation how I had been an agent for this money. I mean, I took so much time into every explanation. I would be all over the Facebook leads. Like I would see something come on. Hey, I'm a buyer looking for first person. I would reach out, then I would DM them, then I would message them again. Like I was, I was obsessed with it. I literally wouldn't leave people alone. I mean, but I made sure I did it in a, and then I sure was it's, you know, that wasn't too overbearing. But I was very much responsive and on top of things and very consistent. And then once I started actually getting some business from that, I always kept up with my clients from there. I knew that these were probably going to be my bread and butter for the future. I learned that the hard way from not taking anybody over from from neighbor bill. All these people I did close, which I had closings when I was younger, I didn't follow what. That's that was a problem. By the way, thank you for, thank you for owning that and being vulnerable and admitting that because every single person on this call is not perfect. And we've all let clients fall by the way side and it's something that it's very unfortunate and also very relatable and it happens. It happens and you know what? It's okay. And as long as you learn from it eventually and then don't do that anymore because it's not helping your business and then don't bitch that you're not getting any referrals, you know. But one thing I wanted to say was I really started doing a ton of open houses. I set open houses for my team all the time. Like I mean, sometimes I sat four open houses for the same property. If my team had a new development so I was like oh my gosh, one and a half million dollar listing, yes please. I'm like I'll do it with just the studs in. And I get a lot of money. Yeah, exactly, right, of course. You know, and like all you need is that one person to come by and just maybe say hey look, we happen to just be in the neighborhood and it's happened. So that was a huge way for me to start getting business, was doing open houses, helping out with showings, getting to know the buildings. Oh my gosh, that was huge. Like that was a big thing because you didn't have high rises and stuff like that out there was only single family homes in Naperva, mostly, you know. There are agents here in Chicago and in other metropolitan, big metropolitan areas that literally make their good chunk of their career in one building or two buildings. Michael Rosenbloom's done that. I've done an interview with him many, many years ago. He's King of that. There's a number of agents that have done that. And so I want to talk about the one that you have done that with, which is called the Metropolitan Place. It's a high rise here in Chicago. But tell us about how you got into that building and how you started to develop relationships so that you became the agent of choice. 100%. So I love that building so much, by the way. It's like it's just got a part of my heart. And the reason why is because that's the home that I grew up in. And I say that because when I was actually dating somebody and they really wanted to move that way and I really didn't want to and I pushed back on it and he was like, no, we got to move here fine. So we end up moving in a metropolitan place and it was such a cool city loft. It was like something that you just kind of see out of the movie or you are something that you have like a vision of in your head when you're like younger. Like when I was like in 1996 and I was like 12 or 13 and I'm like, I just could wait my age great. Sorry. Shoot. But in 1996, you know, and you're thinking like, oh my god, I want to live in the city in this loft and that was what it was basically. So I ended up living there for about six and a half years. And even though I was a renter in there, I was a renter. I was not an owner, nobody knew. And so I was like, I know they invited me to, okay, so they invited me to all of their community events and they're like, oh my gosh, yeah, you're so fun. Why don't you be part of the social committee? And by the way, we should mention to anyone listening that's not normally what they invite renters to do. Anything related to the building because of course that's for owners but they liked you and said, come on by. Yeah, they liked me and I was like, honestly, really into throwing parties. So I was like, hey, let's, we should do this. We should bring my amp because I like, I used to play music and stuff and I had a bunch of different amps and like, oh no, we need to like light this party up, you know? And so I would like suggest different types of catering and music and this and that and come up with all the ideas. So they were super intrigued by it and it really was bringing the community together. And that was really like the biggest step right there into that building was just becoming friends with a lot of the neighbors. And then basically what happened was that boy forgot kicked out and then the new one moved in. So and then that became my husband actually. So my husband, I met him in Metropolitan Place. I know. His, somebody he worked with, they were my next door neighbor. And we basically just kind of like, I don't want to say we brand the building, but like we were just friends with everybody and then I tried making an offer three different times with the owner on our place. I really wanted to buy it and live there and they didn't want to sell it yet and they still haven't sold it. They're still renting it. But after that time, I was like, oh my gosh, I need to be in this building somehow whether I'm gonna live here later on or just sell the shit out of it, you know? So I kept in communication with everybody. And before you know it, I started getting one listing and another listing and another listing and rentals. I'll do anything. Rental listings, buyers, whatever. And I have such a great core connection with them and everybody that actually helps within the network to like pitch that to other sellers for, you know, in case I had like an in-house buyer and house listing or whatever, it might be ryer pocket listing. So I think that I didn't really have to try that hard. It really was just about being part of like a lifestyle. Really, I kind of just made it my lifestyle and that's really how it happened. It was super organic. But you know, like now I do send out marketing material but I don't feel weird doing it where I'm like begging or asking for a business. I probably shouldn't say like that. But I don't feel that I'm asking for a business. They already know who I am and every January they expect to get this booklet from me and it basically states a whole market updated the whole year, everything that I've sold a little bit about my life, how I met my husband there. They have, my dog was born there, you know? Like it is. Oh, so it's exclusive to the building. Just to them only. Just to them only. And I do happy hours with them too. Like I mean, just like literally I will shoot out little messages to the building. I mean, I know so many people there. So I just, I have a personal email and I'll say, hey, you want to go do a little happy hour over at the Mariano's and lost the loop. You know, like that's so funny because we were like, it's a grocery store but that's actually where we used to go and hang out. It's what was like old times, you know? And just really easy, simple stuff. They still invite me to their community events and stuff. It's I'm really lucky. Yeah, it looks like it sounds like to me that you married kind of your passion to this opportunity. It was like, oh, I like doing this. I like being of service. I like throwing, you know, social events and I like being helpful there. And so you just, you know, all of those buildings are always looking for people to help with those things because nobody wants to help. I know like the building I'm at, I will not be joining the board but I also don't complain about anything. So I think that's a fair deal. I go, thank you for the board, whatever, you know, whatever decisions you guys make, I won't complain. But I'm also not going to, I'm not going to do my time. I've done that before and learned my lesson. But, but if I was a practicing agent, I would totally be doing that because great opportunity to, and I'll give you just for anyone listening, you just reminded me of a, of a really simple idea that I think a lot of agents forget. And I'll give you, use myself as an example. So I live in a building called Alcobe, it's in Wicker Park. Anyway, our audience won't know what that is. But anyway, it's a relatively new development like four years old, maybe. Three, three to four years old. I've lived there since the beginning. I can tell you the number of physical marketing materials that have shown up in my inbox from other agents. Literally, there's 46,000 REALTORS in the Chicago Land Area, including the suburbs. I have gotten zero, not one in four years. And I don't think it's because people know I'm in the business. They would be farming everyone in the, in the building. So that is a crazy thing to say. Like I am shocked. Now I understand too, people who move into new construction usually don't leave it with three years. But it would be a great time to start building a relationship with a, with a, with a, you know, a possible future seller. At some point, I'm probably going to move out of there and, you know, and, and cry because my interest rate is so low and I'm going to lose it. But the point is, is, yeah, I've moved. People have moved out of our building, who were only there a year or two, you know, life got in the way for, or they, whatever, they transfer jobs or something. But I am shocked. I am still today. I've been talking about this for years on my podcast. Not one person has ever sent me a piece of mail. Is that, that is, so there, we're talking about is really what you were doing is you were, obviously, and you still do it. You're still putting material together for a building or, oh, yeah. For people listening could be a neighborhood, it could be a community, it could be, it could be really anything that you're interested in. But just to give people an idea that if you think all of, all of these places are being farmed, my building has not been farmed once. And we are, we are a building that should be farmed because we have some good, good sellers in there that, that, you know, have some high priced places. So it's, it's shocking to me, but that's how much opportunity there is. Yeah, it is crazy, right? Yeah. So you could become the alkova person if you want to. I know. I'm like, just wait till you see next month in your mail. It'll be yeah. No, but, but I love that. So this idea of just staying top of mind with this, that, with that building that you're with and being still being a part of it. And also, you know, continuing to add value by sending out, by, by putting those booklets together for that, I mean, that's, that's a wonderful thing. Yeah. For four years, too. It's been consistent. Like just something to the viewers really quick that are maybe even like new reagents and stuff. I know some people like feel like, oh, I did mailers for like six months or years. Right. That's, that's not going to work. You might get lucky. I don't know. I never did, but I can tell you what, I, after four years in a row, I've been gone from that building. This, I've been in, in four years. I, I haven't stopped once. Like, every single month they do get a mailer. And at every single January, if the last four years or five maybe even, they get the booklet. So it's, it's consistency. And what I love about that is it's, it, it, every, every 30 days. And whether they just look at the, you know, the postcard or thing, of course, yeah. And that's, that's okay. We don't even care if they, of course they're going to throw it out. But at least they're going to see your picture and your name before they throw it out, right? It's like, oh, there's the thing of GSMG. Okay, cool. And they toss it. But they see you and they remember, they reminded, they're reminded of what you are, or what you do and who you are. So I think it is a great, great idea. And I'm shocked that more agents aren't doing that. I know doing mailers is expensive and it also maybe seems a bit antiquated. But I'm telling you, people aren't reading their emails. That's the other thing I would love to do a podcast called Nobody reads your emails because nobody reads their emails because nobody does. Nobody does. It's either text message or physical mail. Those are the only things that are actually consistently getting looked at. And even text messages goofy now because, you know, people, there's all sorts of spam on text messages a little harder to do. But, but yeah, so I love that. And it works, but you're right. You have to do it for, for at least a couple of years. For a real, yeah. And you have to be willing just to eat the cost for a bit and realize maybe one transaction is going to pay for the year anyway. Exactly. Exactly. That's the kind of mindset you have to have. You just have to kind of go with it. You know, and if you don't want to pay for that all by yourself on monthly or whatever, maybe there are options out there that you can work out with, maybe partnering with one of your lenders and seeing if they'd be willing to split the cost too. Yeah. Just sort of your sense, this is something I don't ever talk about. And I think it's a fun thing to talk about is you are somebody who I suspect is often told how great your fashion sense is. You have your very intentional about your dress. You have a really unique style that is very cool, at least, you know, to me and not a lot of other people say the same thing about you. How much fun is it to sort of marry your style of, you know, sort of dress with work? Like it seems like that's something that you really truly enjoy. Oh my gosh. This is like the best question ever. So I love fashion so much. Yes, I used to watch the 1990, 1991. I used to watch all of the Donna Karen and DeCan why runway models. Like I was like obsessed. I mean, I would be like sitting in even Marcus just like waiting for my mom in the dressing room while she was like just trying on clothes forever. And I didn't at mine. I would just like look at everything. I just, I am obsessed with fashion. My favorite color is leopard by the way. I know, right? Yeah. But no, I gotta say this like, I feel like that's one thing that might maybe like actually be something unique that might stop me aside from 100%. Some other agents. I'm not really the most typical dressing looking agent. I am, I am very professional. But I believe in being just yourself and I love colors. I love colors. I like black. I love jewelry. I love hair. I'm big into red lipstick. I just love having a very eclectic look. And I think that you can have an edgy eclectic look being in a professional setting still. And you don't have to just wear, you know, just to suit all the time or just to dress all the time. I think there is a way to still have your fashion sense and your style and incorporate that into your showings or whatever it may be. Yeah, I think it really works for you too because it definitely feels authentic to you. Right? So when I've seen you in person, I'm like, oh yeah, that she's very intentional about her dress. It's very cool. It's unique. And probably it's part of your brand. And I think there's nothing inherently negative about that. I know sometimes people want to, you know, obviously your professionalism, your skill level, all of the things you do are really the most important part. But it's nice to have a really intentional aesthetic. And you do. And I think that that's something that a lot of agents could really think about what is my aesthetic, even if it's maybe if it's more conservative, more, more, you know, more edgy, whatever it might be, you know, really be intentional about that. People remember how people are dressed. I mean, they really do. I want to go back all the way back to you at the beginning you talked about really wanting to become a tennis pro. And I just got back from, well, not just, but a few months ago, I went to the US Open out in out in flushing. Yeah. So it was my second year in a row going. Yeah, so much fun. So, and that was, yeah, it's, by the way, if anyone ever has an opportunity to go out to the US Open, if you're in New York, you've probably already done that if you live there. But if you haven't, it's a great opportunity to really see some, some wonderful tennis and just got to get a sense of, of what that, the US Open really is, which is really a lot of fun. But I'm curious about when you were playing, I'm a tennis player as well. But when you were, when you started in tennis and you really were going to make this your career, it's a tremendous amount of discipline like any other sport. So can you talk a little bit about the amount of work that you were putting into it and did that translate over into once you were, you know, a real estate agent, did those skills kind of transfer over? Yeah. So that is a whole other part of my life. It basically was my life. The whole first probably at least the first 15 to 17 years of my life. Yeah. So basically I was a UST tennis player, a UST junior national tennis player. I, from the time I remember since I was about, maybe like six years old, well I started when I was about four. But when I was probably about six or seven is when things had to really get serious. Like I literally was sat down by my parents. I have, I have the European tennis parents, my dad's from Hungary, my mom's from Italy. So, you know, they have the dreams, right? And they call them America. It's like, okay, we have our taunt, or maybe we should be a tennis pro. I don't know. But basically, I had to have a very serious talk with them. And I was about six and a half. I remember I was in a car with them and they're like, you have to choose. You want tennis or you want to be a figure skater because I was doing both. And I chose tennis. So, ever since six and a half, I, I basically just trained every single day. And I was always going after school. I was picked up straight to tennis. I'd get a ten, a private tennis lesson. And then I would, I would have a group tennis training, which would usually be around anywhere from like an hour private to like three hours of training afterwards. It was pretty consistent like that all the way up until high school. When you become like 12 or 13, it's really when it's like serious. And my parents wanted to send me to the to the to the Voltairee. Sure. Down in Florida. Yeah. And it was a little scary because I was 12 when I had another serious talk with them. And they really wanted to take, they really wanted to take it to another level. I was, you know, nationally ranked. It was, it was one of those things were, you either just do it full time at that point. You know, you shut off everything else in your life and you just go for it. I wasn't ready to do it. I was really, I cried a lot about it. I didn't want to do it. I didn't want to leave my parents. Like I was, I don't even know, but it was my friends as much. I just like a big ask to big ask. It's just a big ask and like, you know, but I, but here's the thing. I, it really brought so much routine and discipline to my life now. And you ask like, how do I apply it to or how have I applied it to my real estate life? And you know, my biggest, my biggest thing that I think that I am, that I have a strength in is my, my wellness routine. I've always been into working out. I mean, I used to have a personal trainer at the age of eight. I don't know if people would frown upon that now, but back then, if people really did it, whatever. So I, I had a personal trainer. I was consistently always working out, always eating healthy. I mean, I was always thinking about what I had to eat. And it was, it's, it hasn't changed, honestly. And now, I think the fact that I'm able to wake up early in the morning and I can get things done, I have a schedule. I, I still love to work out. It helps to stress me. And I, I love being a coach for my team. I, I've been coached my whole life. And I, I don't know, I think that it just really helps, but also with, with when I'm with my clients, I mean, I love being super competitive for them. If we're going into a multiple offer situation or maybe not even a multiple offer, just knowing that there's a hot property and they want it, like, I want to get it for them. So it's, it's almost like, to me, I look at it as, it's like a match every time I'm, I'm going out into the field with them. I want to do the best I can for them. And I'm, I'm sure that's got to do with something with how I play tennis. Well, yeah, you, you just have, you had to do a lot of activity. You had to be intentional about your, your food and your, and your schedule and, you know, your exercise. And all of that is, is just being really, and setting up an intentional kind of life where you're like, this is what I do. And maybe it was done for you when you were little because that's, you know, that's how it works. But as an adult, you know, it's, I think a lot of us could benefit from really thinking about building it, it's sort of like letting things happen and, and just kind of going, well, I should do this. I should do that. It's like literally sitting down and saying, let's design my, my diet or let's design my, my health regimen or let's design my marketing practice for finding new clients and not just kind of flying by the emails that come in and responding to text messages and all of the sort of what we need to deal with that's right in front of us that can feel really productive and technically is productive for our existing clients and whatever is urgent in the moment. But this idea of planning in advance, I mean, you talked about like nutrition, like for me, I figured this out many years ago that maybe it's just me and other people wouldn't struggle as much with this. But I realized if I didn't plan my lunch before I left for the day, if I didn't bring a lunch or plan my lunch, I was going to make a bad decision for lunch. So I was, I was literally going to make an unhealthy decision. And so I'm like, well, I can't trust myself to make a good health decision in the moment because I might be stressed out, I might be wanting to escape, I might be just feeling crummy, whatever. And you know, fast food looks pretty good when you're stressed out. So I, and I, and you know, so what I do is I plan my meals out, I batch cook, I do those things, not because I'm like so brilliant, it's because I have such a weak, you know, self control. And so I think that's part of it too is thinking about like, what are you good at? What aren't you good at? And you know, because for you lifestyle is everything. So you are intentional about yourself, but I'm sure there's parts of your business that you aren't good at or that you don't enjoy doing. And can you talk about sort of how you get through those tasks or do you delegate or do you, you know, team members help? So what are, what are the things that about, because everyone has parts of their business if they're doing it all themselves, that they're like, I'm not good at it. I don't like it. I mean, honestly, that's to me, like, that's one of the biggest things to realize in order to become a successful agent, you do need to realize what you don't love to do in your business and you do need to realize what your strengths are in your business, what you like to do. Because if you are doing those things that you don't love, all the time, you're going to get burnt out. And some of those things for me were a lot of the paperwork. I really wasn't enjoying to do those anymore because as your business grows and you now have, you know, eight to 10 to 12 to 14 to 15 listings and then buyers, and now you're like, okay, this is a lot of stuff to do. And you're not able to give your clients as great of service because you're thinking about how you have to upload disclosures, you know, to your deal management system or whatever it is. So one of those things that I decided to do a few years ago was I decided to hire a transaction manager. And it's literally, that's changed my life. So that has been a huge thing for me as far as getting things organized on that end. And then, I did you, sorry. And then for my team, with them, they've been helping me a lot on my showing. So for a lot of my listings, they do assist me on being at those showings. I try to have an agent at every single showing for my listings. Obviously, things do come up, right? In our community, we have somebody always at the showings open houses. I'll be very real with you. I did not love doing open houses. I really don't. And I think that after putting in a little over 17 years, I think that I kind of get to say if I want to do an open house or not, really, or if I feel like it. And just telling you no, I always set my client's expectations with this. And if someone really wants me to be at an open house, of course, we'll do it for them. But my agents are amazing. And they are very hungry to do open houses. And they do them all the time. So I usually have them do my open houses for my listings. So I think those are two, those are probably two, I think of my biggest things right there are really the transaction management side and open houses. Yeah, transaction management is interesting because it, you know, for a good transaction coordinator, just for even one transaction, you can hire people to do individual deals. It's pretty affordable, I found it's like usually on 500 bucks or less, and you only pay for closes. And yeah, you know, the quality can vary depending on who you get, but you can find some decent people eventually. You have somebody you hire somebody and they're, you know, they're your person and that's even better. And the other thing I wanted to also mention is these open houses. So, you know, it's funny because, you know, you talk about your top producer, you're busy, and open houses take time and there's just a lot to do with them. And you've been doing them for 17 years. You're like, okay, you know, maybe it's maybe I can offload or delegate those to some of my team members because they're the ones that probably need leads more than even I do for, which is really what open houses, you know, quite frankly do more than anything is hopefully provide some buyer leads, hopefully for that property, but probably for any property because they're people walking in. So this is something that if I were an agent and I were in your office and I didn't have any listings, I would be begging and pleading with you, please, please, please let me do an open house. And, you know, I'd probably have to earn that the right for you to say, okay, you can do one. And it's something that I want all of our listeners to consider doing. If there's anyone in your office with a listing, beg and plead with them to help, you know, help you, you know, set up an open house and, you know, see, because it's going to help them to the owner, the owner's going to think they're doing something great for their property. It's going to help you as the agent because you're going to learn how to talk to people about real estate and about a particular property. And, and also it's, yeah, it's just a great way to get leads. So I'm, I think that's awesome. I think that's fantastic and, and, you know, begging and you were talking about this when you joined a team, you were like, I was doing a lot of open houses because the team had listed. All the time. Yeah. All the time. It was just, and it was just such a good way to, to be able to, honestly, to, to feel busy, like, you know, especially as being a new agent, it's like, I don't know, I just feel like I loved filling up my weekends with having all of this to do. And then I, at the same time, I remember thinking, wait, I'm also learning how to do this, even better and learning these buildings, like going up and down some of these high rises, like I now know where the amenities are. I know where this is. I, and you're, and you're practicing saying your spiel. I mean, there's a lot to say when you're walking into a condor, if you were asking questions about reserves and this and that, you know, it's like you, you, it's, it's all practice. Yeah. So I think it's a great way for you to be able to practice because they don't teach you this stuff in real estate school. Yeah. Yeah. So everyone listening, open houses still work. They are super effective and they, you know, you, you have to do a lot of them though. You don't do one and expect, you know, five buyers to walk in. They may or may not, but you do 100 open houses next year or that's probably too many to do. But if you do 50 or more, you'll, you'll, you'll find clients that way. So ask the, ask your managing broker or top agents in your office. What you could do to earn an opportunity to do an open house. And I know a lot of top agents will say when people ask them the first time, they'll say, no, they'll go, um, I don't know you well enough yet. Thank you. And I'll keep you in mind. And they want to see if they come back or they want to see how hungry they really are. And then, you know, that, that can also happen too. So even if you get a no, you know, I, I would, my next question would be, could I ever earn a place to do this? Is there something I could do to really prove you that I would be a great fit for this particular listing? Because I want to help your, your seller sell this property. And, you know, so there's all of those things. So yes, make that a big play for 2025. Anyone out there who is struggling with listings and right now it's tough to have to get listings. Let's talk about the current, the current climate right now. We have interest rates which are, are better than they were recently, but they're still a little higher than probably anyone would want where I don't think we're getting back down to the 3% days anytime soon, if ever. But we still have a lot of people locked into that 3% who purchased years ago. So it's, it's a tricky situation for, for sellers right now because they might not want to sell strictly because of that interest rate. So curious if that's coming up for you a lot when you meet with sellers. Does that seem to be, to impact, I, and I just don't know because I'm not out there doing it. Yeah, you know, I mean, I just think it kind of like varies. I do, I mean, I am starting to see people wanting to just sell their homes and they do have that 2 and a half for 3% and they're like, we just have to move. Yeah, you have to move too small. Like, I mean, we're coming up to what, it's been since 2021 and 2020, it's almost been four years, right? So like people are, they have so many different situations. Their families are going really get a job or whatever, maybe a lot happens even in two years. So, you know, we're just seeing a lot of different things happen. I'm really excited to see what's going to happen in the beginning of next year. I mean, we keep hearing all these different things, right? I'm hearing, I don't know about you, DJ, but like, I'm hearing like five and a half percent sometime next quarter. Let's hope. That'd be nice. And I think even I even think six and a half is reasonable. I mean, it's not a fun number compared to, but anyway, I also wanted to just ask about, you know, working with buyers these days because as we know with the NAR settlement, things have changed. We now set up our own commission structure directly with our client as opposed to, you know, a coupling the commission as was done before. Has that changed anything for you? Is it basically still business as usual? Or are you finding that those conversations are more challenging? Are they about the same? Just curious on how that's affected your business? You know, it's funny is that like, I have never done a four-sale by owner before my whole life. And literally, I think it was like August, four to the 15 maybe, whatever, it was like a week or something after the summer was August 17th. Was that any I think when it got, when it took effect? And I had a buyer and he liked this condo and it happened to be a fizzbo. And like, basically, I, he wasn't going to pay out a commission, but I called that seller. It was the easiest conversation. I'm like, hey, this is going to be the commission. I'll, what do you want to net? And that was kind of our conversation. That's how we really started it. And he was like, this, X amount of dollars, I go, great. So if we do X, can we, can I have X? And he was like, that sounds like a great deal to me. And I'm like, okay, cool. So I mean, I don't know. And that's a, that's a fizzbo. That's a fizzbo. And that's a fizzbo. So like, that was a really great way for me to like, just start off right off the bat. Like with, I gave him the broker compensation agreement. I had the talk with the buyer. I mean, everybody was fine and happy. And it worked out great. So that was, I think just like after that, I had, I don't know, I just had like confidence going into it. And also, I don't know, I don't, I didn't really find this as a big of a deal as maybe some people did. Like in my head, I just think it's just what the seller is going to net. So as long as we could come up with that, that number. And if you're an agent that's able to have that conversation with your seller or your buyer, it really shouldn't be that much of an issue. It's really, we're just being more transparent. Now we are being transparent now. That's all it is. Yeah, I think it's, it's buyers were always paying commissions. They just didn't know it. Yeah. It was invisible. It was, it wasn't a check they physically wrote out. It was part of the whole number. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So that's, that's good to know. And then I wanted to also ask, you know, you have your building this team, are you looking for more team members? Are you looking to grow your team? You know, sort of, or you like, this is what I, because I have people on the show who are like, I do not want any more people. This is all I can handle. And then of course, people are, are looking to grow. But what do you see for yourself for, for your team? Wow. I don't have a crystal ball, but I, I would love, I would love to be able to grow my team to maybe one other agent. I don't want to have a very big team at all. Excuse me. I, but I am looking for a, a, a really solid agent that has had some years of experience. So if you're free to reach out, but I am looking for one, for one more team, so I would love to have maybe the max of between four and five people on my team. And I, I would not go any further than that. That's awesome. So for anyone out there who is in the Chicagoland area and wants to partner with the top producer and thinks they could be a value to Gia, you know, reach out to her. Also, if you are in a market where people from Chicago move to, maybe they retire or have a second home or vacation home, that is also a person to connect with. Gia, she would love to chat with you and also people move into Chicago from other markets as well. So if you're one of our listeners from anywhere in the country and you think, Oh, I sometimes have people to refer to in Chicago or I'd like to develop a relationship with Gia because she probably has clients that move out near me. That would be an awesome reason to reach out and see if you guys have some synergies together. And also once you everybody to follow Gia on her, it, how an Instagram, which is Gia Chicago, I will have a link to that in the show notes. Oh, one last question for you. And I think this is always a fun one for, for our listeners is what was a miss, what was a mistake that you made early on in your real estate career that if you could go back and change it, I obviously can't. But if you could, you like, I really didn't do that thing correctly. So is there anything that comes to mind that was like a big, a big sort of, oof, that one didn't work or maybe you lost a big client or something, you know, something like that? There's so many different things, right? I feel like that's how you become successful. You fail so many times. But so many different things. I think, I think honestly, my biggest thing was I'm just not following up with clients when I was, when I was, when I was an agent in the earlier years, I really feel like that was something that I think about a lot, where I just thought, gosh, if I only had a CRM, like I really do, like if I had that, I feel like things would be even different. And then I guess honestly, just to piggyback on that really quick, I wish I moved to the city a little bit sooner. I wish I wish I wish I wish I came a city agent when I was like 26 or 27 because I just feel like that this is where this was, I don't know, it's just like a better fit than I, I don't know, it was just more real or something for me. So I'm hearing, listen to your intuition and intuition is almost never steered me wrong. If I can identify what's true intuition and what's like fear or other things. So if I can kind of separate those out and go, oh, that's intuition telling me to move to the city or whatever, it usually turns out in the right way. And then, you know, the other thing of following up, following up, by the way, you know, you sort of like, well, I guess it's following up. That's everybody's biggest, biggest challenge in this business. So, so let's all remember follow, follow, follow, follow up once the home is sold or the person moves into an apartment. Let's not lose, lose touch with them because of course those people will need you in the future, especially renters. I mean, anyone renting, even if you didn't do the rental, you should have in your calendar when that lease is going to come do and maybe three months ahead of time or four months be like, hey, I know your lease is coming due. Let's talk about maybe what you want, what, what some options for for going for. Yeah. And you've gotten a lot of business doing that. You know, you've worked with renters who took the transition into buyers. Well, anyone out there who is interested in working directly with Gia, maybe your local Chicago agent, reach out to her. We will have all of her contact information in her show notes. And again, if you're somebody who's in a different market, but have people coming and going from the Chicago area and Gia does city and suburbs. She is, she is everywhere. So just reach out to her and also maybe you can develop a nice relationship there. Gia, I am so grateful for your time today. You were fantastic. Really enjoy having you on the day and also just your positivity and sort of joy sort of seems to come through and maybe that isn't the perfect word for me. But I've got what's coming to my mind is joy. You have a lot of joy. And I think that that really goes a long way when things get hard is like still having this like, I mean, I can make this work. I can figure this out. And failing, failing constantly. I'm the same way. I do have a different type of position here in the industry, but I fail way more than I succeed. Way more. And that's that's kind of the secret to my success as well. It's just fail as much as you can and learn like you were saying at the beginning. Yes. And make different choices, of course, in the future. All right. Gia, well, we are so grateful on behalf of our audience. For your time today, you're amazing. We're so thrilled to continue to watch your team build and your production grow.
