[00:01:18] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:21] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:26] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:29] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:31] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:34] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking

[00:02:09] read everything I offer.
[00:02:11] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:16] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:19] It even writes emails for me.

[00:02:51] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate
[00:02:56] agents and four real estate agents.
[00:02:58] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:00] I am your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:02] In just a moment, we're going to be speaking with broker owner Lou Eitalis about her struggles
[00:03:07] with her local state and the National Association of REALTORS and what she wants to see done
[00:03:12] and changed.
[00:03:13] Before we get to Lou, just a few quick reminders.
[00:03:15] As always, tell a friend about this episode.
[00:03:18] I end our podcast in general.
[00:03:20] We appreciate it.
[00:03:21] It helps us get more listeners and we want to help as many agents as possible and also
[00:03:26] leave us a review.
[00:03:27] Let us know what you think of us on whatever podcast app you're listening to, whether
[00:03:31] it's Spotify, Apple podcasts, anywhere.
[00:03:33] We appreciate it.
[00:03:34] We read all your comments and we make changes based on those comments.
[00:03:38] That's all I got for today.
[00:03:39] Let's get right into it.
[00:03:40] My conversation with Lou Eitalis.
[00:03:54] All right.
[00:03:55] Today on the show, my guest is Lou Eitalis of Strategic Realty Services in Wichita,
[00:04:02] Falls, Texas.
[00:04:03] Let me tell you more about Lou.
[00:04:05] Lou Eitalis is a real estate broker and owner of Strategic Realty Services based in
[00:04:09] Wichita Falls.
[00:04:10] Lou has been licensed since 2010 and has dedicated her career to empower clients, promoting fairness
[00:04:16] and challenging the systemic barriers that plague our industry.
[00:04:20] As an advocate for change, Lou is currently pursuing federal anti-trust litigation against
[00:04:26] major industry organizations, including the National Association of REALTORS, to address
[00:04:31] issues like monopolistic practices, forced memberships, and excessive fees that disproportionately
[00:04:37] affect minority professionals and small brokers.
[00:04:41] Throughout her work, Lou strives to create a more transparent and equitable real estate
[00:04:45] industry.
[00:04:46] She's passionate about collaboration and education, encouraging agents to share knowledge
[00:04:50] and resources to better serve clients.
[00:04:53] Lou's mission is to reshape the future of real estate, ensuring it become more inclusive,
[00:04:58] fair, and accessible for everyone.
[00:05:01] I want everybody to follow Lou.
[00:05:03] She has a Facebook group dedicated to this cause, which we have a link to in the show notes.
[00:05:08] And she has a GoFundMe as well, is if you'd like to contribute to help her in her journey.
[00:05:14] Before I bring on Lou, I just want to really quickly make a quick disclaimer that the reason
[00:05:18] we're doing this episode, number one, is I think it's particularly interesting, right?
[00:05:22] We want to hear about agents and their challenges with our industry and our industry partners,
[00:05:28] our industry associations.
[00:05:30] I think that's important.
[00:05:31] Dialogue is good.
[00:05:33] I'm not here in particular to take any stand, one way or the other.
[00:05:38] I just want to report what Lou is, her issues are, and get those out to our audience to see
[00:05:44] whatever all of you think.
[00:05:46] And the reason we had Lou on is we had a lot of people reach out to us and say, you need
[00:05:49] to have this woman on.
[00:05:51] She's doing this really interesting thing.
[00:05:54] And I've been following the story as well.
[00:05:56] In the future, we would like to also ask NAR to consider coming on to address some of
[00:06:01] these issues that she'll be bringing up.
[00:06:04] But want to bring on Lou, Lou, welcome to the show.
[00:06:07] Thank you so much.
[00:06:09] I appreciate you guys taking the time to talk to me.
[00:06:11] I am excited to chat with you because I think, again, I think dialogue is good.
[00:06:15] I've always thought that was one of the things in this last presidential election.
[00:06:19] And I don't want to sort of get political at all.
[00:06:21] But I sort of missed the fact that there wasn't really dialogue about, you know, the sides
[00:06:26] weren't really talking to one another.
[00:06:28] Or, you know, and it just was like you became this tribal thing.
[00:06:31] You chose aside.
[00:06:32] And I think it's good to have all the information so that people can make an informed decision.
[00:06:37] And I also want to mention that, you know, I am a current member of NAR.
[00:06:41] I think that's important for me too.
[00:06:43] I am.
[00:06:43] I am still.
[00:06:44] And so is Lou.
[00:06:45] 
[00:06:45] So we are here just strictly to report what Lou's doing, why she's doing it.
[00:06:51] And you can obviously make up your own mind about what you think the best course of action
[00:06:55] if any is.
[00:06:57] But Lou, let's start before we get to sort of your issues with some of these with our
[00:07:01] associations.
[00:07:02] Let's talk about your journey.
[00:07:05] So tell us how you got into real estate.
[00:07:08] Well, I kind of have to go back a little bit farther than 2010.
[00:07:14] But I was actually interested in getting into real estate when we were stationed in North
[00:07:20] Carolina.
[00:07:22] And because I was married to a military member.
[00:07:27] And then we got orders for I just started taking my classes in 2004.
[00:07:33] And then we got orders for Okinawa.
[00:07:35] So we wound up living in Okinawa for four years.
[00:07:40] And, but I was, you know, like when I came back, when I came back, it was still very
[00:07:45] much in my mind that I wanted to do this.
[00:07:47] I'm very kind of independent.
[00:07:52] I like to think outside the box.
[00:07:55] I don't really like to have a boss.
[00:07:58] I like being my own boss.
[00:08:00] And I had a little bit of taste of that when I was already in Okinawa.
[00:08:05] I was a state home mom at the time when we were here in North Carolina.
[00:08:10] And so when I was in Okinawa, I started my own business there with a website doing
[00:08:17] more importing Japanese crafts and stuff like that.
[00:08:20] And that was extremely successful.
[00:08:22] And I really enjoyed working for myself.
[00:08:24] So to translate that back into the United States was hard because obviously I'm not
[00:08:31] able to access the product when I'm in the States.
[00:08:37] So I thought to, I kept thinking about real estate.
[00:08:44] And so I really wanted to go to college and get my degree as well.
[00:08:50] And while I was doing it, I was like, well, why don't I also do real estate on the side
[00:08:56] while I'm going to college?
[00:08:57] And I've got my two kids.
[00:08:59] And then so it was, it was a, I was doing a lot.
[00:09:02] I was working 40 hours a week regularly going to college for, but my bachelor's degree full
[00:09:08] time.
[00:09:09] And then also taking my real estate classes and, you know, being a single mom with two kids.
[00:09:15] I always love the expression.
[00:09:17] If you want something done, give it to a busy mother.
[00:09:21] They seem to kind of do incredible things like all of the things you mentioned simultaneously.
[00:09:26] And and times of the essence, you know, so I mean, it was very easy for me to get,
[00:09:31] I actually got my degree in two and a half years.
[00:09:35] And that was pretty amazing.
[00:09:37] My kids were great too.
[00:09:39] They were very supportive.
[00:09:40] They, they weren't, they were a little bit older.
[00:09:42] My son was 14 and my daughter was almost eight at the time.
[00:09:45] So it, I was able to have a little bit more freedom to, to do those things and still take
[00:09:51] care of them.
[00:09:52] Oh, and that, since I was, I was pretty lucky.
[00:09:56] And then I got my real estate license and I was starting to do it part time.
[00:10:01] But when I moved and when I came back from the, not from Okinawa, I wound up in witchdopholes.
[00:10:07] This is where I came.
[00:10:09] The reason why I came here was mainly because I had my sister in Denton.
[00:10:14] And then my brother was getting orders for tinker and in Oklahoma.
[00:10:20] And so this was kind of like a middle place between the two.
[00:10:24] And also there was an air force base here.
[00:10:27] So I was able to maintain, try care and all that kind of stuff for my children.
[00:10:33] So it was just a convenient place to go.
[00:10:35] And I liked the fact that it was a small ish town, not like super metropolitan.
[00:10:42] My kids could still be in a, a small military community.
[00:10:48] And we'd benefit from, from those kinds of.
[00:10:53] So being able to access the base when needed.
[00:10:58] It was a little bit of a struggle at the beginning there.
[00:11:01] You know, because obviously I didn't have a really big sphere of influence.
[00:11:06] A lot of the brokers in town, whenever I reached out to them about sponsorship,
[00:11:10] they basically tried to discourage me and be like, well, if you don't know anybody in town,
[00:11:14] you're really going to struggle.
[00:11:15] You're going to have a hard time.
[00:11:17] And I did.
[00:11:18] But it kind of just pushed me to be like, okay, well, you know, watch me.
[00:11:25] Watch me do something.
[00:11:27] I don't know.
[00:11:27] I don't tell me I can't do stuff.
[00:11:29] There have been so many people we've had on the show who people just tried to dissuade them.
[00:11:35] And that became the fire that got them to work late to the evening and got them to succeed.
[00:11:40] So it's certainly.
[00:11:41] I think that definitely made a difference in how I approached my journey in real estate.
[00:11:48] Because when I work hard, when I worked hard, I saw results.
[00:11:55] And that really just kind of pushed me to do more and be more active in real estate.
[00:12:00] It did take me a little while to actually go full time.
[00:12:03] And I wound up saying part time and doing full time regular job because I need medical benefits.
[00:12:10] And, you know, I mean, you have other things going on.
[00:12:13] I was kind of still a little bit new to the area.
[00:12:17] And I wasn't super comfortable with the market.
[00:12:20] I went the route of doing arios.
[00:12:23] Sure.
[00:12:24] Because that's more consistent for me.
[00:12:28] When you get a listing, it's pretty much a guaranteed sale.
[00:12:31] And those listings were even though they're a little bit more work.
[00:12:35] I was afraid of the work and their less commission.
[00:12:39] I wasn't greedy or anything like that.
[00:12:41] But I just wanted to have something that was more flowing and steady.
[00:12:47] And I was very interested in doing arios.
[00:12:50] Like the whole aspect behind not kicking people out,
[00:12:54] and obviously foreclosing on their homes.
[00:12:56] But because that's just not where I met.
[00:12:59] But just the process of how it works.
[00:13:03] And being a part of that was, it has been very educational
[00:13:09] so that I can know all of the ins and outs of everything.
[00:13:13] I would imagine it got you really good at valuing homes.
[00:13:17] Yeah.
[00:13:17] And it introduced me to the market.
[00:13:20] And because I had to do BPO's.
[00:13:21] And I had to do a lot of, a lot of,
[00:13:25] a lot of, I have to do BPO's every three months pretty much.
[00:13:29] And on any of my listings.
[00:13:32] And it definitely gave me a crash course on the areas,
[00:13:37] on the towns, on, you know, because we cover about six different counties here.
[00:13:42] Which I'll call.
[00:13:44] So there's, there's a, and I'm the listing agent for Fannie Mae for the top 13 counties of Texas.
[00:13:50] Wow.
[00:13:52] So I wind up with a lot of listings out in the middle of God's country.
[00:14:01] But go ahead.
[00:14:03] So no, this is, it's super interesting.
[00:14:06] So you started on the Aureo side and BPO's.
[00:14:09] And then how did you make the transition into more traditional style deals?
[00:14:14] Well, that's where I, once I decided, finally after my
[00:14:21] son graduated high school and my daughter was starting high school.
[00:14:28] Or no, she was starting middle school.
[00:14:31] Um, I decided that I was ready to go out and do this full time.
[00:14:37] I had already been in real estate almost five years with that point.
[00:14:40] I was getting my broker's license.
[00:14:46] And if I was going to become a broker, I knew that I needed to just go out and do it.
[00:14:53] And I didn't originally intend to become a broker
[00:14:57] so that I could sponsor agents because I wasn't really in that headspace at that point.
[00:15:02] I was still really doing a lot of Aureos.
[00:15:05] I just didn't want to give commission to the, to my broker.
[00:15:09] Um, and so that was one way for me to, to kind of like get out of that and just be my own boss.
[00:15:19] And I did that.
[00:15:21] I finally cut the umbilical cord with my job.
[00:15:25] And went straight out into the, into the industry, got a little,
[00:15:29] little office, created a little, uh, a little company that I was just doing as a DBA.
[00:15:36] Um, I even called it to something just very personal to me.
[00:15:41] I always, my handle has always been saucy Louise.
[00:15:44] And so I called it saucy Louise real estate.
[00:15:47] Love it.
[00:15:48] And um,
[00:15:50] and, and I just went from there.
[00:15:52] I created, I created, I had that first year.
[00:15:56] I went from, I think it was only like 15 transactions that first and second year.
[00:16:02] I did 77 transactions in like one year.
[00:16:06] That's incredible.
[00:16:07] And it was just, it was just amazing how well it went.
[00:16:11] I mean, I had investors beating my door down
[00:16:15] that were wanting REOs and wanting investment properties.
[00:16:19] And, and I had a, it was just me and my little assistant.
[00:16:23] Wow.
[00:16:24] And now, now you have a brokerage with dozens of agents.
[00:16:26] You have, you have really grown.
[00:16:29] Uh, well, yeah.
[00:16:30] And then that's when I started getting approached by agents that wanted to join me
[00:16:34] and rather than, um, you know, like it's kind of hard to have a guy going,
[00:16:39] oh, I worked for saucy Louise real estate.
[00:16:42] Uh, and my purple sign, you know, like all the things that, that, that, uh, that I did.
[00:16:49] So I thought about purchasing strategic realty
[00:16:54] because the broker that had it had already sold it once before,
[00:16:57] but had taken it back.
[00:16:59] And he was older and he was wanting to retire.
[00:17:02] And I was like, this is a perfect opportunity for me to purchase something that's already well known.
[00:17:06] It's been around for 20 years.
[00:17:08] Um, they already have some agents in the office.
[00:17:12] And so I, I did, I went that route.
[00:17:15] I stepped in as the primary broker and, and purchased his brokerage.
[00:17:19] And that wound up being strategic realty.
[00:17:21] And then it just went from there.
[00:17:24] Um, right now I'm, I'm trying to grow right now.
[00:17:28] My vision is, is evolving and it's changing,
[00:17:32] but I envision that real estate is going to change even from the brokerage side.
[00:17:37] It's going to change to more of a membership style brokerage.
[00:17:40] There might be some traditional ones and some mom and pops and stuff like that.
[00:17:44] Maybe even the bigger ones like RE/MAX and, and, and, and those big franchises that are still going to go with the commission splits.
[00:17:52] But I envision a future where everything is based on membership.
[00:17:58] Very interesting.
[00:17:59] So yeah, let's talk about.
[00:18:01] And so that's where I'm kind of like trying to do.
[00:18:04] We are, uh, let's talk about it.
[00:18:06] So you have made headlines, a lot of headlines.
[00:18:09] And really, you're the first person I'm aware of who has really been vocal enough to take action
[00:18:18] about what you perceive to be our issues and inconsistencies with the National Association of REALTORS.
[00:18:25] So I would love for you to lay out your issues first.
[00:18:31] Let's talk about what you see are the primary concerns that you have with the National Association.
[00:18:38] Well, it's kind of threefold.
[00:18:43] They like this three-tier system and, and I have three problems that I think, um,
[00:18:49] you know, like everything goes in threes, right?
[00:18:53] Primarily, I think that they've lost their mission statement.
[00:18:57] Their original mission statement was to create a, you know, comprehensive
[00:19:02] uh, continuity across the board within within the real estate industry.
[00:19:09] And to support agents and create an actual hub for us to be able to communicate our listings and be able to
[00:19:17] sell faster, sell better, sell to, you know, abroad in our, our, our reach to be able to serve our clients better.
[00:19:28] And right now it's become a, just the, like a, a pretend police force because they're not really,
[00:19:36] they don't really have authority over us, but they're pretending that they do.
[00:19:40] And they're exerting that authority above the above their, their, above their mandate.
[00:19:48] Interesting. So that's one, that's one, that's one side, you know, like, so that's one, yeah.
[00:19:54] With the cooperation agreement, it starts kind of like right there.
[00:19:58] And even, um, you know, like the cooperation agreement, I think, was an overstep and over, over,
[00:20:04] overreach of their, of their business power over us.
[00:20:08] We as business owners should be, we're independent contractors, right?
[00:20:13] Right. Like they shouldn't be able to mandate the way that we run our business.
[00:20:20] They're there for our port. Yes.
[00:20:24] Port, not to tell us how to do things.
[00:20:27] It's very interesting because here in Illinois, just from an employment perspective, we are what's
[00:20:32] called a right to work state, which means that the workers have, have tremendous rights here in
[00:20:38] our state. I imagine, um, I don't know how it works in Texas. However, it's interesting is we're seeing
[00:20:44] brokerages come under scrutiny who are treating their agents who are independent contractors as if
[00:20:51] they are employees. Yeah. And so we're seeing lawsuits start to take, take hold there. And it sounds
[00:20:56] like you have a similar argument to make that the National Association of REALTORS. Yeah.
[00:21:01] They're just, they have, they have, they have this gross overreach that they're doing now. And even with
[00:21:06] the NAR settlement that they just did, that was a, that was a massive gross overreach because now they're
[00:21:12] basically mandating how we as a brokerage handle commissions.
[00:21:18] Like that we have to negotiate. That we have to do these forms. And a lot of agents don't realize
[00:21:26] that those forms are not mandatory, not by law. And in, in no state are those forms mandatory, the
[00:21:34] only mandatory forms that we have as real estate licensees is the ones that are produced by our
[00:21:40] association, by our, by our real estate commission. Interesting. So, so any of those forms that they
[00:21:48] require the brokerage, the, the, the, the buyers rep and the listing agreements and all of those forms
[00:21:55] are voluntary. We're choosing to use them. They produce them for our benefit, not because they're
[00:22:04] required. So they're not required by law, but they tend to be required by associations, by the
[00:22:12] membership, they're required by the membership. And even then, even then they're not required by
[00:22:19] the membership. They're, they're, they're produced for our use. But if we have an attorney
[00:22:23] produce a different form, we can use those forms instead. Interesting. So, do you feel that
[00:22:32] in a way, members are maybe held hostages in the right word, but, but held to the whims of the
[00:22:40] associations, when even though it's not maybe a legal issue, it's more of a membership issue.
[00:22:48] Right. And, and so they, they mandated or they, they settled with court and said that we're
[00:22:54] going to make all of our members sign this, have their buyers, sign this buyers rep agreement.
[00:23:01] And we're not going to allow them to put their commission into MLS.
[00:23:09] So, and, and you know, if they sign this membership agreement, now they're forcing the brokerages
[00:23:17] to negotiate their commission. And they shouldn't be touching the commission. It should not be their
[00:23:24] business, how the commission is done. Gotcha. So the, because I should be able to set that I have a
[00:23:32] fee period. Sure. You know, like my fee is 6% and if you don't like that, then there's other agencies
[00:23:41] that you can go to. You know what I mean? Like, I'm not saying that that's what I do. But I should
[00:23:47] be able to do that. And then by them saying that we're going to make them sign this buyers rep,
[00:23:52] and we're going to make commission negotiable, even though it's always been up to us to negotiate it.
[00:23:59] Not for them to tell us that we have to negotiate it. You know what I'm saying? Absolutely. Yeah,
[00:24:05] that's, that's an interesting. It's always been negotiable. Anything is negotiable. Anything in
[00:24:09] the contract has always been negotiable. However, for them to actually tell us that we have to
[00:24:16] negotiate and that we can't put it somewhere where it's clear and concise to the other agents.
[00:24:26] What the commission has been negotiated for them is also kind of like a conflict of
[00:24:35] telling us how to do our business. Yeah, so I see your perspective is that we,
[00:24:43] the system wasn't broke enough to need to need a fix. Is that? Yeah, that was, and by them settling,
[00:24:54] they also created precedent. They created case law. They created, oh, you know, like,
[00:24:59] what I'm seeing right now in the industry as far as like the way that agents are treating this
[00:25:04] whole thing is that now they feel like they have permission to discriminate. Can you explain that?
[00:25:11] Tell me more about that. Well, because the whole reason why we got into the lawsuit in the first
[00:25:16] place was because sellers felt like they were being forced to pay a buyer's commission,
[00:25:23] or they were, they were like told that they might not sell their property as fast if they didn't pay.
[00:25:31] Okay, and so now with this lawsuit settlement, now the agents in town are calling all of the
[00:25:43] listings that they're about to show like they haven't even showed it yet and finding out how much
[00:25:48] the commission is. And then they go to their client and say this, this, this, this, and this house
[00:25:54] do not offer buyers commission. You want to go see them. And they're saying no.
[00:26:01] Right. Of course, you know, like they don't want to go see those houses. So now, basically,
[00:26:07] those houses that are not offering commission are being discriminated against.
[00:26:13] Gotcha. And we can legally do that now. Right. And, and I want to also touch on your perspective of
[00:26:22] this, the commission agreement sort of impacting minority or socioeconomically challenged groups.
[00:26:32] Okay. So yeah. And that's another thing too is that it creates a situation where somebody that
[00:26:38] can't afford to come to the table with even $3,000. And so we get creative as agents to make sure
[00:26:48] that that, you know, we get them grants and we get them down payment assistance and we get them
[00:26:53] closing costs from the, from the seller. We might increase the sales price a little bit to
[00:26:58] accommodate for some things too. Those people are now being told that, well, I mean, we've always
[00:27:06] told them that the commission is XYZ, but now they're, they're facing an additional $5, $6,000,
[00:27:15] potentially to pay a broker to help them find a home. And these are people that have never found,
[00:27:22] you know, never bought a house before. So it's discouraging a lot of first time home buyers
[00:27:27] is what I'm thinking. It's making it definitely, it's a different, it's a bigger, it's a bigger
[00:27:32] challenge, right? Because now people have to have cash on hand, which not it does, or, or they're not
[00:27:40] actually using agents. Well, that's the other thing, right? Yeah. So are you seeing that a lot in your
[00:27:46] area where you're seeing a lot more transactions that bypass at least one side of it's bypassing an agent
[00:27:52] or I imagine. I imagine a lot of sellers, I don't know that we're seeing this a whole lot in
[00:27:57] Chicago. We have seen it where, you know, some, they're basically sellers saying, let's try it
[00:28:03] without, I'm going to list it with the REALTOR, but let's, I'm not going to offer a co-op commission.
[00:28:09] And then let's, you know, let's, let's see what happens. Yeah, let's wait to give, and, and,
[00:28:14] and you know what, it's always kind of been that way. And in one, in one way or another, I've always
[00:28:20] showed my listings, you know, I'll list your property for xyz6%. If I get both sides, then I might,
[00:28:28] you know, what we can talk about the commission, or if there's another agent, I'm going to give them
[00:28:33] three percent. I've always been upfront about that kind of thing. You know, and they, they always
[00:28:38] try to negotiate the commission, and I'm always open to it, you know, at the onset of the listing.
[00:28:45] Some agents and some brokers aren't, but I am seeing right now that there's a lot of
[00:28:52] agencies that are, and they're, it's just so, it's like the Wild Wild West. Some agencies that
[00:29:00] are only offering two and a half percent, and they don't have to disclose what they're getting.
[00:29:07] They could be, they could be charging six percent and only giving the buyer's agent two and a half
[00:29:11] percent and keeping the other four and a half percent. So it's creating a lot of, it's basically made
[00:29:18] a lot of the regulations or not regulations. The, uh, NAR benefits kind of obsolete,
[00:29:25] especially with that co-operation agreement. You know, like, yeah, we have a co-op
[00:29:29] agreement to work with other agents, but do we?
[00:29:36] That's interesting. Um, let's, and I think we only got to a couple of your key pillar points.
[00:29:42] So I feel like, okay, so that's that, that's number two, um, that they're, they, they just, they,
[00:29:58] remember, number three is the fact that they, I mean, number two is the fact that they
[00:30:04] are tying all of these memberships together. Like I can't pick and choose just to be a part of NAR
[00:30:11] or just to be a part of tar or just to be a part of WFAR based on the services. It should be
[00:30:17] voluntary. If they're going to make it voluntary, they need to make it voluntary. You know,
[00:30:22] and, and, and now when you typically, at least how it works here in Chicago is when you join a
[00:30:28] local association, you're automatically joining automatically. Yeah. Right. And, and, um, I mean,
[00:30:36] then don't say that it's, that it's, that it's not mandatory. You know, make it mandatory. Make
[00:30:42] it, you know, and for brokers, it makes it, for brokers, it makes it mandatory no matter what.
[00:30:48] Yes, the real estate agents can choose to join or not. And, um, and that's where the whole tie-in
[00:30:57] comes in where the real estate agent that joins pays their own fee, but the non-REALTOR, the
[00:31:05] non-member winds up getting, um, if they work with a broker that is in NAR, the broker has to pay
[00:31:13] their association fees. Yeah, let's talk about that because this was an issue for you.
[00:31:18] Where you were, you received a bill. Tell us the story. This is kind of what spurred you to,
[00:31:24] to take action. Correct. And the way it, the way it all started was I sponsored an agent here in
[00:31:32] which it all falls. And she was doing a real estate here. She was part of the association, but then
[00:31:39] she moved to Houston and removed, you know, got out of the association here and was going to join
[00:31:46] down there, but wound up having a stroke and just kind of got out of real estate. But one,
[00:31:54] wanted to stay active so that she could still get referrals. She still had a lot of family here
[00:31:59] in which she'll falls and she was referring a lot of those clients to me and I was doing the,
[00:32:04] I was doing the, uh, the listing or selling the house or whatever for her and then just giving
[00:32:10] her a referral fee. And obviously you can't do that if you're not an active agent.
[00:32:16] So she just wanted to remain active and I was like, yeah, sure, whatever, you know, do, do, do,
[00:32:22] do what you need to do. I'm not, I'm not super, I'm not, I'm very flexible when it comes to, you
[00:32:29] know, thinking a little bit outside the box. And then another agent, and I didn't really even think
[00:32:37] to tell the brokerage, I mean, the association that that's what was going on. I mean, I was just like,
[00:32:43] I wasn't really fully aware myself on the way that worked because I'd only been sponsoring agents
[00:32:51] at that point for like four years. So it had never been an issue where I had to, you know, like,
[00:32:57] never sponsored or not a member before. And then another agent approached me that was going to
[00:33:06] get an employment with a apartment complex down in Dallas area. And they required that this agent
[00:33:13] have an active license. She wasn't going to be doing any real estate, but she needed to have her
[00:33:20] active license in order to do leasing for whatever company she was working for. She was an in-house
[00:33:27] leasing agent essentially, right. But she needed an active real estate license to sponsor her because.
[00:33:35] But because you're a brokerage, they have to be members, right. And like I said, right. Well,
[00:33:42] like I said, I didn't really under, I didn't really know that that was a thing, you know, like my broker
[00:33:47] never told me that. He just told me you have to be a part of the association. And he never really
[00:33:52] explained all the background behind it. I mean, that's a lot of problem with our industries. We
[00:34:01] don't really educate everybody on how it works. And even a lot of agents nowadays don't understand
[00:34:07] what those forms like I learned all of these things through this journey. And I'm telling now
[00:34:14] everybody that I can that I come across is like those forms because everybody's complaining about
[00:34:19] them. And I keep telling everybody those forms are not required. So you need to make sure that you
[00:34:27] tell your agents or tell you, you know, you remember it's not mandatory by the state, by the state
[00:34:33] that we're in. It's not by law required that you sign those forms. If you don't want to, if you don't
[00:34:40] want to use them, you can use something else. And so let's go back to the two agents that were.
[00:34:47] Yes, I sponsor. I sponsor. I kept them in my in my roster and I didn't, I heard some, I got an email
[00:34:55] from my association. They in that tar had notified them of two non members that had. So the state
[00:35:03] and tar is the state association association of REALTORS. Yeah. I had notified them that I had
[00:35:09] two non members, which to me is also like what the hell. So basically you had one agent that was
[00:35:19] just doing referrals really not participating other than to live in area. Right. Just said,
[00:35:26] hey, I have a friend who needs help and passed the lead to someone. And then you had another
[00:35:30] agent who goes, no, I just have to have this somewhere, but I'm not doing any actual transactions.
[00:35:38] Any transactions I work in house for a company that owns the building or manages the building. I
[00:35:43] work in and I'm in a different area, but I still have to have it active in a legal
[00:35:48] in order for me to be able to do these. And so the state says, hey, we noticed these two people aren't
[00:35:56] members of your local association. The local comes back to you and says what? And basically says that
[00:36:05] they need them to come in and fill out an application and fill and pay all these fees.
[00:36:14] Or I need to unsponsor them. So I need to fire them or I need to make them pay.
[00:36:24] Right. And I was like, for me, I was like, what gives you the authority to do something like that
[00:36:32] to tell me how to run my business and who I can hire and fire or sponsor or not sponsor.
[00:36:40] But that was my initial reaction to it. And then they were like, and then, you know, so it went
[00:36:45] from there. They explained that it's in the bylaws and all this stuff and showed me where it was
[00:36:52] in the bylaws. And it was just so confusing because it's really not in the bylaws, like as
[00:36:57] clearly as concise as they made it sound. Like it says that yes, it does say that the broker is
[00:37:05] responsible for every sales to pay for the the association. And you'll do this for every sales
[00:37:12] person in the firm. Now that's about as clear as it gets. And to me, that leaves a lot for
[00:37:21] interpretation. You know, like are you talking about the firm within the jurisdiction of the bylaws,
[00:37:27] which is only six counties. So then the ones in Houston and for a worth wouldn't apply. And if
[00:37:33] if it to, you know, if jurisdiction doesn't matter, then why wouldn't Oklahoma also fall under
[00:37:38] the same thing because they're with my firm. I have a brokerage license over there. And they're all
[00:37:44] under strategic realty. So that's still under the umbrella of the firm. Do I have to pay for them
[00:37:51] to be a part of our association? You know, like there's there's a lot of ambiguity in our bylaws
[00:37:58] as it's written. And and then it's not clear what the punitive damages are. Like it says that I'm
[00:38:07] supposed to notify them of any non members, but it doesn't say if if I don't report them what happens.
[00:38:15] And so they get to choose how they punish me for not reporting these members. And like, but
[00:38:22] so they just and rather than having a conversation or trying to work with with us as members,
[00:38:30] they just go straight to punishment. You know, like it just it was very punitive the way that they
[00:38:36] treated the whole situation. And it did it lacked any any any outside thinking, you know, like
[00:38:47] they did I told them what what what happened. I explained to them what the situation was back in
[00:38:52] May. And I asked him to go to the board and see if they would either do a waiver or have some sort of
[00:38:58] exception to this this situation. And in in August, the last day of August, I got an email with an
[00:39:08] invoice from the board saying that they they voted and that I needed to pay for both that they
[00:39:16] weren't going to give me a waiver and that I needed to pay for both of those agents. Going back to
[00:39:22] the date of sponsorship and it wound up being like $3,500 for the annual dues, MLS dues, the MLS fees,
[00:39:31] the Century Lock fees, the application fees, the membership startup fees, you know, like everything
[00:39:37] was included from Kittenkbull, even though they never applied, they never participated, they never
[00:39:44] accessed any of the benefits of the services, you know, like it was just totally backwards like
[00:39:51] and then to boot, they threatened that to take me out the term and name my membership,
[00:39:56] which was coercive and almost like this racketeering kind of, you know, feeling when I went it just
[00:40:04] it upset me to the point where I almost just said, well, you know, fuck it, sue me, you know, kind of
[00:40:13] thing. But then I, you know, I thought about it and I didn't want to it basically it would have
[00:40:23] it would have shut me down. Right, you would have affected. You would have affected all your other
[00:40:27] agents. Right, because because that's where the tie-in comes in. They make it to where the
[00:40:32] filter right it makes it the way that they have it set up, they make it so that it's required for
[00:40:38] us to be a part of the association regardless of whether or not we sponsor agent, you know,
[00:40:45] like regardless of the fact that the agents have their own membership. So it ties us all into this
[00:40:53] big huge lump. I have to get a membership here at WFAR if I have agents that want access to MLS
[00:40:59] here. I have to get my I have to be a part of the association in Denton. If any of the agents that
[00:41:05] I sponsor want MLS access down in Denton, I also have to, so I have to be a part of every single one
[00:41:11] of these little associations regardless of whether I'm in the in the area. But obviously, which
[00:41:19] shelf always is going to be my primary. Right. So it ties me into all of these little agents.
[00:41:26] And you feel you've even used stronger language where you feel that it is in a sense a reverse
[00:41:32] pyramid scheme. Absolutely. I mean, because they're they're getting enriched from me. They're
[00:41:39] getting money from me instead of me bringing money into the business via having people sign up.
[00:41:48] It's costing me every time I sign somebody up. So that to me is a reverse pyramid scheme.
[00:41:54] But. And so what ended up happening with the your local association issue?
[00:42:01] Well, like I said, they threatened to terminate my membership if I didn't pay it by a ex date or
[00:42:07] whatever. And it happened to fall like right around Thanksgiving. And that created, you know,
[00:42:14] a lot of anxiety for me. So I just wanted to pay in the invoice under under dress even though the
[00:42:21] the way that they did it violated even their own process in the bylaws. Like they they didn't I
[00:42:28] disputed the invoice and it didn't change. It didn't change the clock, you know, like in the in the
[00:42:33] bylaws, it states that on I think this is pretty much an everyone that you if you don't pay an
[00:42:40] invoice by the third month, like they hadn't even invoiced me at the beginning. Like the the whole time
[00:42:47] between May when they notified me of these nonmembers, they didn't send me an invoice at that point.
[00:42:53] So it's not like there was any any financial obligations that I was pending at that point even.
[00:43:00] We were just having a discussion about the membership themselves, the members themselves.
[00:43:06] They didn't invoice me until the end of August. And at that point, they invoiced me for everything
[00:43:11] rather than just for the annual dues. And they claimed that that because it was too late,
[00:43:16] that I'd already violated their blah blah blah blah blah. You know, like,
[00:43:21] if there was an option to only pay the annual dues, why didn't you send me that invoice and then
[00:43:28] wait until I declined to to pay that invoice before escalating it further. You just went straight to
[00:43:35] escalation. And then they took it to the board before they even gave me the invoice to dispute.
[00:43:43] Like they made all of these decisions about penalties and and and fines and stuff before I even
[00:43:50] got there. You know, so to me, it felt very very punitive, very very unfair. Like it wasn't it was just
[00:44:00] it was just the wrong way that they they basically you felt that it was a shut up and pay us.
[00:44:05] Right. It's just it was just a very coercive money grabbing opportunity for them and they went all out.
[00:44:16] And so with all of the issues you're you're sort of bringing to the table. Actually, before we get to
[00:44:23] sort of let me let me finish that portion of it. So basically by then I had actually already
[00:44:30] unsponsored these two agents because now I'm afraid they're going to keep continuing to charge me
[00:44:35] this stuff and I'm not going to pay that. So basically I had to fire them. And now going forward,
[00:44:46] I just I was not able to to sponsor anybody that didn't want to be a part of the association. So
[00:44:58] tying my ability to increase my revenue. So you feel it's limiting. So from the top down, you feel
[00:45:08] it's so intertwined and so just rigid that you as a business owner are limited in what you can
[00:45:18] and can't do. And that's telling me how to run my business. Yeah. Even though they claim that it's
[00:45:25] not mandatory. And but but even though it's not mandatory, they tie it also into MLS access.
[00:45:33] And that's number three, if they if they if they had no tie into MLS access, they then this would
[00:45:42] be an issue. If I want something as essential as MLS because MLS is essential for all of us is
[00:45:50] role jurors, all of us is real estate agents. That's essential to our business. If they tie,
[00:45:57] if they untied that, then this wouldn't have been an issue. I don't think.
[00:46:07] Yeah, so you're looking at one real quick. Let me rethink that one real quick because I do think that
[00:46:16] MLS is it MLS has its its benefits obviously, but
[00:46:23] having it at just a local level is very uninclusive. Sure. People outside that area.
[00:46:32] Right. Right. But however, you know, if we want access to it,
[00:46:37] them tying it into the memberships is is also, you know, bad for us as it's also an overreach,
[00:46:45] I think, in the business sense of free trade and and teacher's laws and whatnot.
[00:46:53] And so you feel that the problem starts all the way at the top top being NAR as the sort of
[00:47:01] supreme parent company or the parent association. And tell us what you're doing right now. What
[00:47:08] how are you what would you rather what would you like to see done and they'll start there? What
[00:47:15] would what would you like to see changed? Well, and this goes back to I've been doing a lot of
[00:47:20] research on the lawsuits that have that have occurred in the in the country over the years.
[00:47:26] And back in the 80s, there was a lot I'm a pretty big lawsuit that changed the way that NAR
[00:47:33] treated MLS because back at the beginning NAR did have control over MLS and they got sued in the
[00:47:41] 1980s. And so they said that they won't have any for monopolistic and antitrust laws and stuff
[00:47:51] like that. I think it was in California where they got sued. But so that's when they pushed MLS
[00:47:58] to be at a local level, controlled at a local level instead of at a NAR level. So a lot of these
[00:48:04] responses that we're getting is that NAR doesn't require that you have MLS access in order to be a
[00:48:09] part of the association because technically they don't. But when they tie themselves into the
[00:48:17] local association, then by default, they're requiring it. Because the local association.
[00:48:22] So you feel that that's like a sneaky way to get what they want. Right. They said, okay, so we won't
[00:48:30] have control over it the local associations every time that they have a lawsuit. And if you go
[00:48:35] back and you look at all of these lawsuits that they've had over the years, instead of changing
[00:48:41] the way they parent or the primary directive is at their level, they push it down to the local level.
[00:48:51] Everything like MLS, the the the do's and fees that are set by the local association,
[00:48:59] the everything that they've been sued for has been pushed back. Even the now new one,
[00:49:08] they've pushed it down to where it's now at a level where the MLS, which is controlled by the
[00:49:14] local board, controls how MLS deals with the commission. Interesting. So you feel like they're passing
[00:49:24] their path. They're passing the buck. Yeah, they're passing the buck down below. But they're so
[00:49:30] basically they're they're not changing really. They're just not requiring it anymore. So they're
[00:49:39] turning it down to the boards done locally for them to require it. Because they have to approve
[00:49:45] the bylaws of all the associations to make sure that it is in line with their mandates.
[00:49:52] Yeah, it's interesting. I've I felt that that was a I found that to be confusing when they when
[00:49:58] NAR came out and said, well, you don't have to be a member. But to my knowledge, the vast majority
[00:50:04] of local and state associations are members. So and you there isn't another option really. Right.
[00:50:14] So why not just say, yeah, actually, I mean, why not be transparent, I guess, about that. Right.
[00:50:20] And they're all about transparency, right? So do you think that this is there's a
[00:50:28] systemic issue that that needs to be open. And it needs to be overhauled. Do you think they should
[00:50:33] be just erased altogether? You know, what are your thoughts? Well, I mean, you can do either one.
[00:50:39] Either one is going to be beneficial for the industry. The the only reason why I still think that
[00:50:45] NAR I want to give NAR a chance to do the right thing is because they do have the reach.
[00:50:52] A lot of agents, the reason why they don't come forward or they don't speak out is because they
[00:50:58] are afraid to rock the status of the status quo. They're afraid to change those things that they
[00:51:05] like about it. Or they're afraid to lose access to M less, which is the primary reason why we go
[00:51:13] with a lot of these associations in the first place. Yeah. Excuse me. So or they're, you know, like
[00:51:22] we change our every time we change the way things do business, they have to rethink their own
[00:51:30] strategies as far as how they gain customers. And you know, like change is not is not very easy
[00:51:37] for anybody, especially the older generation of REALTORS that have been doing this since
[00:51:42] the beginning of time. And or might be a little bit more technologically inclined. I mean,
[00:51:49] a challenged. There's a lot of fear that they're that they don't want to change. So if NAR made the
[00:51:58] changes on their end, it would be easier for the industry than getting rid of them all together
[00:52:07] and starting from scratch. You know what I mean? Because how many how how fast would that be?
[00:52:14] It would take so much longer for everybody to veer from the thinking that NAR is is good.
[00:52:22] So the amount of control that NAR has right now is would be beneficial for the membership because
[00:52:29] they could change everything if tomorrow, you know, like that. And why do you think they
[00:52:37] is it you feel they I'm curious to get your answer for why you think they don't make those changes?
[00:52:41] Is it because that you feel that they can just push it down down the down the line to the state
[00:52:47] don't want to lose control. They don't want to lose the control. You know, like that or or
[00:52:54] or it's a failure of a it's a failure of imagination. They they they have all the control right now
[00:53:00] and they say, well, you know, this is how it is. And if you guys don't like it, then you know,
[00:53:05] tough find another way to do it. And guess what? There's really not a another way to do it.
[00:53:11] Right. And so then they don't have then they have to sit then they can sit back and do nothing
[00:53:16] because nobody so it's twofold really. If they refuse, then we must
[00:53:23] as an industry terminate them. So I would like to give not on opportunity to make these changes,
[00:53:34] to have an overhaul. But we don't have the time to sit around and and and wait for them to come to
[00:53:44] their senses. We have to make them come to their senses. Or we have to change our way of doing
[00:53:52] business now. I foresee in five years, we could be the next travel agents.
[00:53:59] Are you worried? You're worried about being replaced by technology. Right. Totally. I mean,
[00:54:06] the amount of AI interaction in our lives right now is astronomical. It is it is something that is
[00:54:13] not and it is not being talked about. This idea that yes, we yes, agents have value and they should
[00:54:20] be compensated. I don't think anyone would disagree who is who is an agent. If you don't think you
[00:54:25] have value, then you should get out. But that's not the conversation that we need to be having.
[00:54:31] Right. You need to be having the conversation that how are we going to compete? Yes.
[00:54:36] In the future of this industry, not that we don't have value and that we shouldn't expect to get paid,
[00:54:45] that's going to happen. We need to stop worrying about that and we need to worry about how we're
[00:54:51] going to keep the business. Yeah. What happens when AI? So it's funny. I ask GVT all sorts of
[00:54:59] problems that I can't figure out. And within five seconds, it has been answered for me. It's not
[00:55:05] always accurate. But what happens when AI is going to be better at negotiating because it has access
[00:55:10] to billions of data points than any human being ever could. How critical and again, it's not
[00:55:17] that's not the only value an agent provides. Obviously, we know that. But there's going to be a lot
[00:55:23] of people that are going to rely upon or in any even check their agents recommendations. And we
[00:55:31] are human. We're prone to that. Of course, of course. And that is going to create a challenge to
[00:55:37] keep the perception of value. The reason why we tell people to use this as agents is because
[00:55:45] we're telling them that we are the experts that we know how this is work going to work. And that
[00:55:52] this the process of buying home is so stressful that you need us to be able to make that big purchase
[00:56:04] less difficult. And if they can go on to chat GPT and just type in how do I buy a house and it
[00:56:11] tells them everything that they need to know, even gives them all the forms, gives them all the
[00:56:15] data that they need. Then what do they need us for? If we don't make ourselves indispensable to
[00:56:23] the industry, then we're going to be dispensed. And how do you think how do you think we can make
[00:56:30] ourselves indispensable? We need to create better processes, better ways of doing the business that
[00:56:40] we do. Whether I mean, right now everything is like the Wild West out there. There's so many
[00:56:45] different products. There's so many different CRMs. There's so many different
[00:56:50] like brokermet and zip forms and dot loop and all this other stuff. I'm not saying that we need
[00:56:56] to create a monolithic program, but we need to bring something together to where like my vision,
[00:57:04] if NAR had any vision, they would have created a platform with Realtor.com as the consumers side
[00:57:14] and then a platform for the agent side of that. And it would have been all inclusive to include
[00:57:22] like a showing service that we could pay for, you know, like levels. That's what I envision that
[00:57:27] the future is going to be. It's going to be a membership style MLS service. Kind of like one that
[00:57:34] already exists right now that is used by a lot of the local agents in a lot of these rural areas and
[00:57:41] even some bigger areas like New York is my state MLS. I'm not sure if you're familiar with that.
[00:57:50] But if you log into their platform and you pay their $45 a month, you have access to all the
[00:57:57] state forms pretty much for every state in the country because it's national. You have access to
[00:58:03] national listings everywhere. You have access to marketing material that you can use and they produce
[00:58:09] this every month with new ideas, new canva backgrounds, new little quips that you can customize a
[00:58:21] little bit here and post it on your social media. They also provide add-ons for showing services.
[00:58:28] They also and it's inexpensive and they're very, very communicative. Anytime that you have a
[00:58:40] problem or an issue or whatever, you just send them a text or give them a call and they're there.
[00:58:48] Well, I'm surprised too that maybe the lessons learned from what Zilla was able to do in the early
[00:58:55] 2000s when they came on to the scene and said, we're a tech company and we understand human
[00:59:01] behavior and we're going to create a very appealing product that's totally free for the consumer
[00:59:09] that bypasses the gatekeeper, the agent because we're going to basically pull all those listings
[00:59:17] and now they're a broker in every state so they because they're an MLS member, they get those
[00:59:21] listings and also we're going to value each home that's out there and they have created,
[00:59:31] I think the Zilla touches over 90% of all real estate transactions now.
[00:59:36] And if they created a platform for MLS, then NAR would be done because it would be almost a game
[00:59:46] over scenario. Yeah, if they created their own back end MLS plug-in, I guess is what you would
[00:59:53] call it, it would be over and they could charge the brokers a little membership fee or whatever
[01:00:01] and then we wouldn't need any of the services of NAR on tar. It's really funny because every single
[01:00:09] one of these associations have their own level of benefits and services and they're,
[01:00:17] obviously now as members we're starting to see which one provides us with the most and NAR,
[01:00:25] I've logged into NAR twice in probably 15 years. I don't know why I even, they're even necessary
[01:00:35] at this point. I don't know what services they provide anymore. They used to provide discounts and
[01:00:42] I mean really the only thing that they provide is the acronyms that people can
[01:00:47] you can call yourself a REALTOR. Yeah and you can call and you can you've earned the right to
[01:00:54] call yourself a REALTOR for $156 a year. And to their credit, they also have a powerful lobbying
[01:01:04] or part arm of their organization for the industry. Right but lobbying hasn't really paid much
[01:01:13] and dividends to us at this point. Yeah that's debatable about what the effectiveness of that
[01:01:21] lobbyists are when you know with a $420 million payout. Exactly. Yeah.
[01:01:29] As a member, how did you feel about obviously you felt that their reaction to losing lawsuit was
[01:01:38] a bit of an overreach and decoupling the commissions and making it a little bit more challenging
[01:01:44] for agents in your opinion to have those conversations and maybe more challenging for first time
[01:01:49] home buyers. All the different forms that they added to our repertoire is just more is more
[01:01:53] cumbersome and confusing. It makes it very confusing for these agents especially the older ones.
[01:02:00] I mean the younger ones are going to get used to it because it's all that they're going to know.
[01:02:05] But the change that it created for the older ones is getting to be a really big burden for a lot of
[01:02:13] brokers. And it probably creates a lot of anxiety and broker owners like yourself because you're
[01:02:20] ultimately responsible for everything the agents do. Yeah and I mean a lot of it's unnecessary and
[01:02:28] and it's not always succeeding. It's actually causing like the one that Carla, Carla's lawsuit over
[01:02:34] in Louisiana. She had an experience where one of her agents lost a $15,000 commission because
[01:02:43] one of her buyers went and saw a property that was being shown as a open house. And when they went
[01:02:52] to the open house, the listing agent had them sign a buyer's rep.
[01:02:59] Yeah. Just to see the property. Which is not necessary, which was completely not necessary.
[01:03:07] It's not part of, but it was permissible. And so, you know, like based on the interpretation of
[01:03:15] the rules, they're saying, you know, we have to make everybody sign a buyer's rep whenever they
[01:03:20] want to see one of our houses. And that's not part, that's not a requirement.
[01:03:26] You so it's like they didn't they just haven't explained the rules succinctly enough that people
[01:03:33] are getting it. And they're taking advantage of the ambiguity in a lot of ways.
[01:03:39] And they have to be losing membership because people are just leaving the industry in
[01:03:46] in droves. And yes, of course, there's a lot of factors that contribute to that. You know,
[01:03:51] the rates are obviously higher than a lot of agents would prefer and buyers would prefer.
[01:03:56] Listings are a lot of us are just, you know, I would love to know what I would love to see NAR
[01:04:02] addresses. What are what are about the 85% of American homeowners that have a like sub 4%
[01:04:11] loan? Like what's good? Like that's a huge problem. And you know, if somebody doesn't come up with a
[01:04:20] product or a solution to encourage, I mean, we can just wait for people to have to move. And
[01:04:26] that's of course kind of what we're doing now. What for close years, you mean? Well, no, I just mean,
[01:04:31] you know, life events, people have to move or they decide to move. But boy, you know, again,
[01:04:37] I'm not blaming NAR for this. I'm just hoping that they could say, you know, we've got a real
[01:04:41] problem here. There's a huge bottleneck that we're going to see in the next few years for listings.
[01:04:46] If we don't sort of figure out a motivation for a lent for, you know, a borrower to take a much
[01:04:54] higher rate. And I don't know what that solution is. But we sort of all just go, well, it is kind
[01:05:00] of what it is. And that's true. It is what it is. But someone needs to be working on a solution
[01:05:07] to this because so many people are hamstrung. So many owners are hamstrung going, well, I don't
[01:05:13] want to double my payment to live in the same type of property or it's of the same value. If I sell
[01:05:19] and repurchase again, I'm going to be like twice as what you're, you know, paying in the
[01:05:25] same way. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the only solution to that is going to be to for the interest rights
[01:05:30] to go down. They need to go back down to something that's a little bit more comprehensive. And I
[01:05:35] think that with the, I'm hoping that with the new administration and that a lot of the issues,
[01:05:46] a lot of the overblown prices is going to kind of level out and we're going to be able to get back
[01:05:52] to 4%. I mean, I don't think that we'll get back to 2%. But you know, something a little bit
[01:05:59] more accommodating and a little bit more reasonable. Even if it goes down to only 4% would be would be
[01:06:05] great for the consumer. Well, you have laid out your grievances with the associations at all levels.
[01:06:15] I think it's been a really interesting conversation. So let me just add in there the second
[01:06:23] invoice that they sent me, which is the one that actually put me over the edge and had me going
[01:06:29] into the lawsuits is really the one that that we haven't talked about. But just very quickly on
[01:06:37] that one, that one was the second agent that he was already an agent before and he just wanted
[01:06:46] to reactivate his license so that he could do some stuff part time and he's down and forward.
[01:06:53] And I'm a part of the association down there in Denton and I told him, you know, like I'm a part
[01:06:58] of this association. So once I sponsor you just go over there and fill out their application.
[01:07:03] However, I never heard from him again. You know, and this was like right at COVID time frame.
[01:07:10] Sure, I was extremely busy and he never spoke to me again. He never was part of any of our meetings.
[01:07:16] He was never asked for access to the platform. I gave him access, but he never to like my back end
[01:07:23] platform, but he never finished the onboarding process or whatever. And I never heard from him again.
[01:07:28] And I just totally forgot about it. Well, I get the same thing. I get an email from them
[01:07:32] stating that there's a non-member reported, but with this email, they automatically sent me an
[01:07:39] invoice immediately for the $1,700, which was all the fees. The fees, the application, the
[01:07:49] MLS dues, I mean, MLS quarterly fees and annual fees. So now you're going through the same
[01:07:58] situation, but a different process. Right. And so now you're like, well, there's not even
[01:08:02] consistency within the process. Right. So they sent me an invoice right off the bat. And I
[01:08:08] disputed it at that point. And I called up the director. And he's like, well, you've done this
[01:08:13] before. So that's why we went, you know, like you've you've already been more. So I was like,
[01:08:19] well, I'm not paying it. And guess what now? And this was right. Right after the settlement. So
[01:08:24] I was already agreed by it because of that. And I was like, you know what? I'm just going to take
[01:08:28] you guys to small claims because this is bull crap. I don't know if you can swear on your thing,
[01:08:36] but you know, I got the okay. I got I suffer from a little bit of the cursi words.
[01:08:45] Friendship or addiction. I try to keep myself clean because I'm doing all these podcasts,
[01:08:50] but sometimes it's just it's a better a better way to communicate. But anyway, so I
[01:09:00] went to small claims and filed there and had them served. And that was back in August of last year.
[01:09:14] Now, in November, I get an email from the board from him saying that the board voted on the
[01:09:21] invoice that I'd been sent, even though I disputed it or whatever, I never really had much of a
[01:09:27] chance to actually talk to anybody at the board about it. I that they voted that it was valid and
[01:09:35] that if I didn't pay, I got the I got the letter on the 22nd of November. And then I had to pay by
[01:09:40] November 5th December 5th. No, November 5th. I mean, November 27th. Sorry, I got I got the
[01:09:48] invoice by November 22nd on November 20th. You had a five day window. And right, right. And
[01:09:53] I had a five day window to pay this invoice of $1,700. And that just like, you know,
[01:10:04] I contacted a couple of lawyers in the area and nobody really wants to get involved in it.
[01:10:10] Nobody, you know, like lawyers aren't exactly kind of like us where we just kind of want stuff done
[01:10:15] now and and times of the essence. And you know, I've got an emergency here. They're about to kick me
[01:10:22] out. They're about to like affect my business right at Thanksgiving. Again, you know, one year later.
[01:10:29] And and at this point, I'm just done. So I had spoken to a couple of agents. I mean, not an agent,
[01:10:36] a couple of attorneys. And they had mentioned when I when I went to the class action,
[01:10:43] they immediately hired an attorney. So, you know, I mean, when somebody else, the other party
[01:10:48] hires an attorney, especially in small claims, I don't know why they hired an attorney. But
[01:10:55] and it's obviously our dues that are going to be paying for it. When they did that, I went and
[01:11:02] I talked to a couple of attorneys in town and none of them wanted to deal with it because they
[01:11:06] felt like they do a lot of business with local REALTORS in town and they didn't want to lose
[01:11:14] their own business by defending me in this case. And so I went outside the area a little bit and
[01:11:23] most of the attorneys that I spoke to said that it probably should have been filed in federal court
[01:11:28] not in small claims because if I was going to charge them with anti violations or violations of
[01:11:36] the Sherman Act and the anti trust act, that was more of a federal issue. Small claims would have
[01:11:42] only been able to handle anything that I paid. So that invoiced the invoice that I that I had
[01:11:48] paid already was valid. But the one that I hadn't paid, I had to take to federal court. So I
[01:11:57] went ahead and because of that email, I went ahead and put together a complaint based on like I
[01:12:07] went and I looked at all the other complaints that had already been filed by then
[01:12:11] because I already the Michigan one, the class action at Michigan and filed, it was one in California
[01:12:17] and there was one in Pennsylvania that had been filed. And I kind of hodged, paged mine to have the same
[01:12:24] language and issues as theirs, including the invoice of the $1,700, not $3,500 one because that one
[01:12:33] was going to be dealt with in small claims. But the $1,700 one was the one that I included in
[01:12:41] the federal and I asked for an injunctive relief to keep them from just you know, terminating my
[01:12:47] membership. That was the important part because small claims couldn't give me like a restraining order
[01:12:53] or anything like that. And and that's that's one of the reasons why that was the primary reason why
[01:13:00] I filed it in the first place was because I was I was at I was in in danger of losing my business
[01:13:11] right before Christmas. And I just couldn't I just couldn't take it anymore. I was like, no, you guys
[01:13:19] have totally you tell you you you went one step too far. And and the sad part about it is that these
[01:13:26] are fed for the the board is made up of my fellow agents. Right. So these are other people in
[01:13:35] town that are voting. So it felt very punitive. It felt like, oh, you know, your competition is voting
[01:13:43] my competition is voting against to close me down. And I'm not that I'm not the big I'm not the big
[01:13:50] Kuhna in town. Most of the people that are on the board are on the in those big ones.
[01:13:57] And if we look at the actual reason why these agents weren't paying, it was because they're not in
[01:14:04] the area or they're not accessing. Yeah, they're the level of harm versus the benefits to the
[01:14:12] to the association is is totally skewed on my side. Like the harm is on me. To them, it won't cost
[01:14:22] it doesn't cost them anything. It just enriches them. It just it just gives them more to the you
[01:14:29] to the coffers of their organization. To me, it closes my doors. And that is is a violation of my rights
[01:14:41] as a business owner. That's it. Gross overreach of their power.
[01:14:48] Well, well, well argued and and very interesting point I'm interested to continue to follow, you know,
[01:14:57] your your case at the federal level and see, you know, what happens. We're obviously watching
[01:15:04] all the lawsuits. And it's very interesting to see where where things are headed. I'm seeing like
[01:15:11] right now we're still at the beginnings of everything. So there's not really much to report.
[01:15:15] But if you if they want to get more information as we go, they can access that Facebook page because
[01:15:23] every time I have to respond or I get a response from them from from the the courts or whatever,
[01:15:31] I try and keep everybody up to date on that. And so far, the only response that we've gotten is a
[01:15:36] motion to dismiss, which I've I've responded to. They're trying to get it dismissed on with prejudice.
[01:15:47] Oh, and we just finished the small claims a couple days ago as well.
[01:15:52] Oh, how did that go?
[01:15:54] Um, it was interesting. It was definitely practiced for me because, uh, you know, if I don't win, I'll chalk it up to practice.
[01:16:02] And I might I might take it to appeal. If I don't win, um, just depends on if they award them attorneys fees because they're asking for like $9800 in the attorney's
[01:16:14] fees. Well, so if they if they go that, if I if it goes that route, then more than likely, then I will appeal it.
[01:16:22] Um, the judge hasn't ruled on it yet. Like the court, the case itself, we just presented our case at this point.
[01:16:32] And he's going to be ruling on it probably either. He said that it would probably be next week before I hear anything.
[01:16:40] But as far as the case is concerned, I think that I laid out my case fairly succinctly and it was based my basis was just the fairness of it all.
[01:16:51] And the fact that the bylaws are not clear and concise and any ambiguity based on the there's a there's a statute. It's called the restatement of contract section 206.
[01:17:05] That states that any ambiguity in a contract must be interpreted against the party who wrote the contract.
[01:17:16] So any ambiguity in the contract itself in the bylaws must be interpreted against them.
[01:17:23] And I pointed out several places in the bylaws that it's just ambiguous and not clear.
[01:17:30] The jurisdiction issue itself is not clear because it does state that they're they only have jurisdiction over six counties.
[01:17:38] So is it jurisdiction over me?
[01:17:41] Do you restriction over the agents jurisdiction over the firm? You know, like is there is there a cutoff?
[01:17:48] And if there isn't a cutoff, then why does other states not apply? You know, like there's there's there's way too many questions to be had.
[01:17:58] Another ambiguity is that there is no provisions in the bylaws for
[01:18:05] real clear that that they clearly had the right to do the things that they did.
[01:18:11] Like yes, it does say that I'm what within 10 days I must help them about any nonmembers in my firm,
[01:18:20] but it doesn't say what the punitive damage you know, like what the punishments would be if I don't.
[01:18:25] So like it doesn't it doesn't give them it doesn't turn around and give them the authority to go and
[01:18:31] bill me $3,500 and then threaten to terminate me if I don't pay it doesn't give them that authority.
[01:18:40] Well, for all of our listeners who are interested in you know, following lose cases at the local and the federal level,
[01:18:49] as well as just you know, wanting to support her mission.
[01:18:53] They we she has two ways you can do that. There's a Facebook group. We'll have a link to that in the show notes.
[01:18:57] And there is also a go fund me where you can contribute to the defense fund to that she is mounting and for the cost associated with, you know,
[01:19:07] taking on, you know, the industry associations.
[01:19:11] So and those those things are also for other agents to like if they if there's other agents that have similar issues that they need help with.
[01:19:21] I'm more than happy to give them, you know, my experience and let them decide what they want to do at that point.
[01:19:30] If they want to be a part of the Texas lawsuit, they can also reach out to me and I can see what I can do on that.
[01:19:40] If they want to start their own lawsuit, that would be also, you know, a good place for them to go to get some information about how to go about it.
[01:19:49] And also anything that's raised in that go fund me if it's above and beyond what I might need, which I'm sure.
[01:19:58] Right now I'm hoping that it is so that I can also help other people and other lawsuits that are already out there.
[01:20:07] Fund to their attorneys and get the assistance that they need in order to be successful.
[01:20:12] As ultimately we want this to we want the change.
[01:20:16] We need the change in this industry otherwise we are going to be the next travel agents.
[01:20:23] Well, we're going the way the dodo bird y'all.
[01:20:28] I appreciate your perspective. I appreciate the courage it takes to talk about something like this.
[01:20:34] I think that that is not an easy ask for anyone. It's also not any it's an easy ask. Actually everyone's got an opinion about it.
[01:20:42] But for somebody to take action is and to be publicly taking action while running a business that is seemingly in conflict with, you know, with some of the issues that you're addressing is.
[01:20:57] I'm finding that yeah, I'm finding that there is a lot of people that are out there that support the efforts that I'm doing and are like you they applaud the efforts or, you know, they understand the courage that it takes.
[01:21:10] But I would just state that it doesn't take a lot of courage to do this. It just takes a minute to say enough is enough.
[01:21:20] You know, I mean, I don't feel like I'm a trendsetter or anything like that. I feel like I just, you know, I'm just that fed up with it.
[01:21:33] And we need to not be afraid to speak up because otherwise we can't complain. We can't complain about the way things go.
[01:21:44] It's a good point and it's easy to complain and it's not as easy to sort of, you know, request change from the people that can make those changes.
[01:21:55] And so, and ultimately I also feel like if they're, if not and and all of these associations really intend to be.
[01:22:06] Supportive of our mission, our businesses, they will make the change. The way that they react to all of these lawsuits is going to be very indicative of how much they are actually working for us.
[01:22:23] I think I feel like, you know, if they, if they don't, I'm not saying settle. I'm not saying, you know, make us go away and give us money. I'm saying the change because most of us don't want to settle.
[01:22:35] Most of you want to just, you want to keep running your business.
[01:22:38] Yeah, we want to see the change. We want to be a beat, beat, beat, run our businesses better. So I don't see that this is going to go away just by throwing money at it.
[01:22:52] So they're going to, they're going to have to make that hard choice. Are they going to be supportive of what we're telling them that we need or are they going to just make it go away.
[01:23:03] And continue with their, with their bad acts.
[01:23:09] Perfectly summed up. And for all of those that want to continue to support Lou and her efforts, the Facebook group and the GoFundMe are in our show notes.
[01:23:20] And also we encourage, I would love to have a conversation also with someone at NAR to, you know, sort of talk about what changes they're working on to maybe address some of these concerns.
[01:23:32] We will be hopefully coming with a future episode with someone representative there that can give us a little bit more insight into what they're with their.
[01:23:42] I would love to, I would love to hear what their ideas are. And I'm more than happy to collaborate with anybody at NAR if they want more ideas on how they can improve our industry because we're on the, we're the boots on the ground.
[01:24:00] You know, we're the ones that actually do the work. We're the ones that are actually down in the trenches and we know what we're facing on a daily basis.
[01:24:10] And we can, we can tell them very distinctly what we need in order to improve the industry.
[01:24:17] They need to start listening to us. Otherwise, we're going to, we're going to get rid of them.
[01:24:24] Well, I really appreciate Louie coming on. We talked for, we had a great long conversation. I appreciate your willingness to share with my audience your perspective.
[01:24:36] And also I know we have tens of thousands of listeners. So for those of you that want to continue or want to support Lou, you know, we have those links in the show notes.
[01:24:46] And also, yeah, and we, and behalf of our audience, we thank you for your time. Also on behalf of Lou and myself, we thank the audience for sticking around to the end.
[01:24:57] We appreciate you as listeners or viewers. Please, as always, the best way that you can help us continue to grow is by telling another REALTOR about this podcast.
[01:25:05] You know, everyone's got an opinion about the, the changes that have been happening. This might be an episode to share with them to see to get their thoughts because perhaps they would have, you know, thoughts that were either consistent or, or, or not with Lou, but at least, you know, they know this conversation is happening.
[01:25:23] And I think conversation, as I said at the beginning, is always good. It always can lead to, to, you know, improvements.
[01:25:30] So whatever improvements, if it need to be made, they need to happen through dialogue. So I appreciate you, Lou, sharing your, your perspective. I'm very excited to hopefully bring someone from an AR on to talk about their perspective and just continue to provide the audience, you know, with, with information they can make up their own minds.
[01:25:47] So we appreciate you. Thank you so much for coming on and on behalf of all of us, you know, we thank our, our guest Lou and we thank you the audience for continuing to support us.
[01:25:58] And we will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks Lou.
[01:26:02] Thank you.

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.

I am your guide and host through the show. In just a moment, we're going to be speaking with broker owner Lou Eitalis about her struggles with her local state and the National Association of REALTORS and what she wants to see done and changed. Before we get to Lou, just a few quick reminders. As always, tell a friend about this episode. I end our podcast in general. We appreciate it. It helps us get more listeners and we want to help as many agents as possible and also leave us a review. Let us know what you think of us on whatever podcast app you're listening to, whether it's Spotify, Apple podcasts, anywhere. We appreciate it. We read all your comments and we make changes based on those comments. That's all I got for today. Let's get right into it. My conversation with Lou Eitalis. All right. Today on the show, my guest is Lou Eitalis of Strategic Realty Services in Wichita, Falls, Texas. Let me tell you more about Lou. Lou Eitalis is a real estate broker and owner of Strategic Realty Services based in Wichita Falls. Lou has been licensed since 2010 and has dedicated her career to empower clients, promoting fairness and challenging the systemic barriers that plague our industry. As an advocate for change, Lou is currently pursuing federal anti-trust litigation against major industry organizations, including the National Association of REALTORS, to address issues like monopolistic practices, forced memberships, and excessive fees that disproportionately affect minority professionals and small brokers. Throughout her work, Lou strives to create a more transparent and equitable real estate industry. She's passionate about collaboration and education, encouraging agents to share knowledge and resources to better serve clients. Lou's mission is to reshape the future of real estate, ensuring it become more inclusive, fair, and accessible for everyone. I want everybody to follow Lou. She has a Facebook group dedicated to this cause, which we have a link to in the show notes. And she has a GoFundMe as well, is if you'd like to contribute to help her in her journey. Before I bring on Lou, I just want to really quickly make a quick disclaimer that the reason we're doing this episode, number one, is I think it's particularly interesting, right? We want to hear about agents and their challenges with our industry and our industry partners, our industry associations. I think that's important. Dialogue is good. I'm not here in particular to take any stand, one way or the other. I just want to report what Lou is, her issues are, and get those out to our audience to see whatever all of you think. And the reason we had Lou on is we had a lot of people reach out to us and say, you need to have this woman on. She's doing this really interesting thing. And I've been following the story as well. In the future, we would like to also ask NAR to consider coming on to address some of these issues that she'll be bringing up. But want to bring on Lou, Lou, welcome to the show. Thank you so much. I appreciate you guys taking the time to talk to me. I am excited to chat with you because I think, again, I think dialogue is good. I've always thought that was one of the things in this last presidential election. And I don't want to sort of get political at all. But I sort of missed the fact that there wasn't really dialogue about, you know, the sides weren't really talking to one another. Or, you know, and it just was like you became this tribal thing. You chose aside. And I think it's good to have all the information so that people can make an informed decision. And I also want to mention that, you know, I am a current member of NAR. I think that's important for me too. I am. I am still. And so is Lou. So we are here just strictly to report what Lou's doing, why she's doing it. And you can obviously make up your own mind about what you think the best course of action if any is. But Lou, let's start before we get to sort of your issues with some of these with our associations. Let's talk about your journey. So tell us how you got into real estate. Well, I kind of have to go back a little bit farther than 2010. But I was actually interested in getting into real estate when we were stationed in North Carolina. And because I was married to a military member. And then we got orders for I just started taking my classes in 2004. And then we got orders for Okinawa. So we wound up living in Okinawa for four years. And, but I was, you know, like when I came back, when I came back, it was still very much in my mind that I wanted to do this. I'm very kind of independent. I like to think outside the box. I don't really like to have a boss. I like being my own boss. And I had a little bit of taste of that when I was already in Okinawa. I was a state home mom at the time when we were here in North Carolina. And so when I was in Okinawa, I started my own business there with a website doing more importing Japanese crafts and stuff like that. And that was extremely successful. And I really enjoyed working for myself. So to translate that back into the United States was hard because obviously I'm not able to access the product when I'm in the States. So I thought to, I kept thinking about real estate. And so I really wanted to go to college and get my degree as well. And while I was doing it, I was like, well, why don't I also do real estate on the side while I'm going to college? And I've got my two kids. And then so it was, it was a, I was doing a lot. I was working 40 hours a week regularly going to college for, but my bachelor's degree full time. And then also taking my real estate classes and, you know, being a single mom with two kids. I always love the expression. If you want something done, give it to a busy mother. They seem to kind of do incredible things like all of the things you mentioned simultaneously. And and times of the essence, you know, so I mean, it was very easy for me to get, I actually got my degree in two and a half years. And that was pretty amazing. My kids were great too. They were very supportive. They, they weren't, they were a little bit older. My son was 14 and my daughter was almost eight at the time. So it, I was able to have a little bit more freedom to, to do those things and still take care of them. Oh, and that, since I was, I was pretty lucky. And then I got my real estate license and I was starting to do it part time. But when I moved and when I came back from the, not from Okinawa, I wound up in witchdopholes. This is where I came. The reason why I came here was mainly because I had my sister in Denton. And then my brother was getting orders for tinker and in Oklahoma. And so this was kind of like a middle place between the two. And also there was an air force base here. So I was able to maintain, try care and all that kind of stuff for my children. So it was just a convenient place to go. And I liked the fact that it was a small ish town, not like super metropolitan. My kids could still be in a, a small military community. And we'd benefit from, from those kinds of. So being able to access the base when needed. It was a little bit of a struggle at the beginning there. You know, because obviously I didn't have a really big sphere of influence. A lot of the brokers in town, whenever I reached out to them about sponsorship, they basically tried to discourage me and be like, well, if you don't know anybody in town, you're really going to struggle. You're going to have a hard time. And I did. But it kind of just pushed me to be like, okay, well, you know, watch me. Watch me do something. I don't know. I don't tell me I can't do stuff. There have been so many people we've had on the show who people just tried to dissuade them. And that became the fire that got them to work late to the evening and got them to succeed. So it's certainly. I think that definitely made a difference in how I approached my journey in real estate. Because when I work hard, when I worked hard, I saw results. And that really just kind of pushed me to do more and be more active in real estate. It did take me a little while to actually go full time. And I wound up saying part time and doing full time regular job because I need medical benefits. And, you know, I mean, you have other things going on. I was kind of still a little bit new to the area. And I wasn't super comfortable with the market. I went the route of doing arios. Sure. Because that's more consistent for me. When you get a listing, it's pretty much a guaranteed sale. And those listings were even though they're a little bit more work. I was afraid of the work and their less commission. I wasn't greedy or anything like that. But I just wanted to have something that was more flowing and steady. And I was very interested in doing arios. Like the whole aspect behind not kicking people out, and obviously foreclosing on their homes. But because that's just not where I met. But just the process of how it works. And being a part of that was, it has been very educational so that I can know all of the ins and outs of everything. I would imagine it got you really good at valuing homes. Yeah. And it introduced me to the market. And because I had to do BPO's. And I had to do a lot of, a lot of, a lot of, I have to do BPO's every three months pretty much. And on any of my listings. And it definitely gave me a crash course on the areas, on the towns, on, you know, because we cover about six different counties here. Which I'll call. So there's, there's a, and I'm the listing agent for Fannie Mae for the top 13 counties of Texas. Wow. So I wind up with a lot of listings out in the middle of God's country. But go ahead. So no, this is, it's super interesting. So you started on the Aureo side and BPO's. And then how did you make the transition into more traditional style deals? Well, that's where I, once I decided, finally after my son graduated high school and my daughter was starting high school. Or no, she was starting middle school. Um, I decided that I was ready to go out and do this full time. I had already been in real estate almost five years with that point. I was getting my broker's license. And if I was going to become a broker, I knew that I needed to just go out and do it. And I didn't originally intend to become a broker so that I could sponsor agents because I wasn't really in that headspace at that point. I was still really doing a lot of Aureos. I just didn't want to give commission to the, to my broker. Um, and so that was one way for me to, to kind of like get out of that and just be my own boss. And I did that. I finally cut the umbilical cord with my job. And went straight out into the, into the industry, got a little, little office, created a little, uh, a little company that I was just doing as a DBA. Um, I even called it to something just very personal to me. I always, my handle has always been saucy Louise. And so I called it saucy Louise real estate. Love it. And um, and, and I just went from there. I created, I created, I had that first year. I went from, I think it was only like 15 transactions that first and second year. I did 77 transactions in like one year. That's incredible. And it was just, it was just amazing how well it went. I mean, I had investors beating my door down that were wanting REOs and wanting investment properties. And, and I had a, it was just me and my little assistant. Wow. And now, now you have a brokerage with dozens of agents. You have, you have really grown. Uh, well, yeah. And then that's when I started getting approached by agents that wanted to join me and rather than, um, you know, like it's kind of hard to have a guy going, oh, I worked for saucy Louise real estate. Uh, and my purple sign, you know, like all the things that, that, that, uh, that I did. So I thought about purchasing strategic realty because the broker that had it had already sold it once before, but had taken it back. And he was older and he was wanting to retire. And I was like, this is a perfect opportunity for me to purchase something that's already well known. It's been around for 20 years. Um, they already have some agents in the office. And so I, I did, I went that route. I stepped in as the primary broker and, and purchased his brokerage. And that wound up being strategic realty. And then it just went from there. Um, right now I'm, I'm trying to grow right now. My vision is, is evolving and it's changing, but I envision that real estate is going to change even from the brokerage side. It's going to change to more of a membership style brokerage. There might be some traditional ones and some mom and pops and stuff like that. Maybe even the bigger ones like RE/MAX and, and, and, and those big franchises that are still going to go with the commission splits. But I envision a future where everything is based on membership. Very interesting. So yeah, let's talk about. And so that's where I'm kind of like trying to do. We are, uh, let's talk about it. So you have made headlines, a lot of headlines. And really, you're the first person I'm aware of who has really been vocal enough to take action about what you perceive to be our issues and inconsistencies with the National Association of REALTORS. So I would love for you to lay out your issues first. Let's talk about what you see are the primary concerns that you have with the National Association. Well, it's kind of threefold. They like this three-tier system and, and I have three problems that I think, um, you know, like everything goes in threes, right? Primarily, I think that they've lost their mission statement. Their original mission statement was to create a, you know, comprehensive uh, continuity across the board within within the real estate industry. And to support agents and create an actual hub for us to be able to communicate our listings and be able to sell faster, sell better, sell to, you know, abroad in our, our, our reach to be able to serve our clients better. And right now it's become a, just the, like a, a pretend police force because they're not really, they don't really have authority over us, but they're pretending that they do. And they're exerting that authority above the above their, their, above their mandate. Interesting. So that's one, that's one, that's one side, you know, like, so that's one, yeah. With the cooperation agreement, it starts kind of like right there. And even, um, you know, like the cooperation agreement, I think, was an overstep and over, over, overreach of their, of their business power over us. We as business owners should be, we're independent contractors, right? Right. Like they shouldn't be able to mandate the way that we run our business. They're there for our port. Yes. Port, not to tell us how to do things. It's very interesting because here in Illinois, just from an employment perspective, we are what's called a right to work state, which means that the workers have, have tremendous rights here in our state. I imagine, um, I don't know how it works in Texas. However, it's interesting is we're seeing brokerages come under scrutiny who are treating their agents who are independent contractors as if they are employees. Yeah. And so we're seeing lawsuits start to take, take hold there. And it sounds like you have a similar argument to make that the National Association of REALTORS. Yeah. They're just, they have, they have, they have this gross overreach that they're doing now. And even with the NAR settlement that they just did, that was a, that was a massive gross overreach because now they're basically mandating how we as a brokerage handle commissions. Like that we have to negotiate. That we have to do these forms. And a lot of agents don't realize that those forms are not mandatory, not by law. And in, in no state are those forms mandatory, the only mandatory forms that we have as real estate licensees is the ones that are produced by our association, by our, by our real estate commission. Interesting. So, so any of those forms that they require the brokerage, the, the, the, the buyers rep and the listing agreements and all of those forms are voluntary. We're choosing to use them. They produce them for our benefit, not because they're required. So they're not required by law, but they tend to be required by associations, by the membership, they're required by the membership. And even then, even then they're not required by the membership. They're, they're, they're produced for our use. But if we have an attorney produce a different form, we can use those forms instead. Interesting. So, do you feel that in a way, members are maybe held hostages in the right word, but, but held to the whims of the associations, when even though it's not maybe a legal issue, it's more of a membership issue. Right. And, and so they, they mandated or they, they settled with court and said that we're going to make all of our members sign this, have their buyers, sign this buyers rep agreement. And we're not going to allow them to put their commission into MLS. So, and, and you know, if they sign this membership agreement, now they're forcing the brokerages to negotiate their commission. And they shouldn't be touching the commission. It should not be their business, how the commission is done. Gotcha. So the, because I should be able to set that I have a fee period. Sure. You know, like my fee is 6% and if you don't like that, then there's other agencies that you can go to. You know what I mean? Like, I'm not saying that that's what I do. But I should be able to do that. And then by them saying that we're going to make them sign this buyers rep, and we're going to make commission negotiable, even though it's always been up to us to negotiate it. Not for them to tell us that we have to negotiate it. You know what I'm saying? Absolutely. Yeah, that's, that's an interesting. It's always been negotiable. Anything is negotiable. Anything in the contract has always been negotiable. However, for them to actually tell us that we have to negotiate and that we can't put it somewhere where it's clear and concise to the other agents. What the commission has been negotiated for them is also kind of like a conflict of telling us how to do our business. Yeah, so I see your perspective is that we, the system wasn't broke enough to need to need a fix. Is that? Yeah, that was, and by them settling, they also created precedent. They created case law. They created, oh, you know, like, what I'm seeing right now in the industry as far as like the way that agents are treating this whole thing is that now they feel like they have permission to discriminate. Can you explain that? Tell me more about that. Well, because the whole reason why we got into the lawsuit in the first place was because sellers felt like they were being forced to pay a buyer's commission, or they were, they were like told that they might not sell their property as fast if they didn't pay. Okay, and so now with this lawsuit settlement, now the agents in town are calling all of the listings that they're about to show like they haven't even showed it yet and finding out how much the commission is. And then they go to their client and say this, this, this, this, and this house do not offer buyers commission. You want to go see them. And they're saying no. Right. Of course, you know, like they don't want to go see those houses. So now, basically, those houses that are not offering commission are being discriminated against. Gotcha. And we can legally do that now. Right. And, and I want to also touch on your perspective of this, the commission agreement sort of impacting minority or socioeconomically challenged groups. Okay. So yeah. And that's another thing too is that it creates a situation where somebody that can't afford to come to the table with even $3,000. And so we get creative as agents to make sure that that, you know, we get them grants and we get them down payment assistance and we get them closing costs from the, from the seller. We might increase the sales price a little bit to accommodate for some things too. Those people are now being told that, well, I mean, we've always told them that the commission is XYZ, but now they're, they're facing an additional $5, $6,000, potentially to pay a broker to help them find a home. And these are people that have never found, you know, never bought a house before. So it's discouraging a lot of first time home buyers is what I'm thinking. It's making it definitely, it's a different, it's a bigger, it's a bigger challenge, right? Because now people have to have cash on hand, which not it does, or, or they're not actually using agents. Well, that's the other thing, right? Yeah. So are you seeing that a lot in your area where you're seeing a lot more transactions that bypass at least one side of it's bypassing an agent or I imagine. I imagine a lot of sellers, I don't know that we're seeing this a whole lot in Chicago. We have seen it where, you know, some, they're basically sellers saying, let's try it without, I'm going to list it with the REALTOR, but let's, I'm not going to offer a co-op commission. And then let's, you know, let's, let's see what happens. Yeah, let's wait to give, and, and, and you know what, it's always kind of been that way. And in one, in one way or another, I've always showed my listings, you know, I'll list your property for xyz6%. If I get both sides, then I might, you know, what we can talk about the commission, or if there's another agent, I'm going to give them three percent. I've always been upfront about that kind of thing. You know, and they, they always try to negotiate the commission, and I'm always open to it, you know, at the onset of the listing. Some agents and some brokers aren't, but I am seeing right now that there's a lot of agencies that are, and they're, it's just so, it's like the Wild Wild West. Some agencies that are only offering two and a half percent, and they don't have to disclose what they're getting. They could be, they could be charging six percent and only giving the buyer's agent two and a half percent and keeping the other four and a half percent. So it's creating a lot of, it's basically made a lot of the regulations or not regulations. The, uh, NAR benefits kind of obsolete, especially with that co-operation agreement. You know, like, yeah, we have a co-op agreement to work with other agents, but do we? That's interesting. Um, let's, and I think we only got to a couple of your key pillar points. So I feel like, okay, so that's that, that's number two, um, that they're, they, they just, they, remember, number three is the fact that they, I mean, number two is the fact that they are tying all of these memberships together. Like I can't pick and choose just to be a part of NAR or just to be a part of tar or just to be a part of WFAR based on the services. It should be voluntary. If they're going to make it voluntary, they need to make it voluntary. You know, and, and, and now when you typically, at least how it works here in Chicago is when you join a local association, you're automatically joining automatically. Yeah. Right. And, and, um, I mean, then don't say that it's, that it's, that it's not mandatory. You know, make it mandatory. Make it, you know, and for brokers, it makes it, for brokers, it makes it mandatory no matter what. Yes, the real estate agents can choose to join or not. And, um, and that's where the whole tie-in comes in where the real estate agent that joins pays their own fee, but the non-REALTOR, the non-member winds up getting, um, if they work with a broker that is in NAR, the broker has to pay their association fees. Yeah, let's talk about that because this was an issue for you. Where you were, you received a bill. Tell us the story. This is kind of what spurred you to, to take action. Correct. And the way it, the way it all started was I sponsored an agent here in which it all falls. And she was doing a real estate here. She was part of the association, but then she moved to Houston and removed, you know, got out of the association here and was going to join down there, but wound up having a stroke and just kind of got out of real estate. But one, wanted to stay active so that she could still get referrals. She still had a lot of family here in which she'll falls and she was referring a lot of those clients to me and I was doing the, I was doing the, uh, the listing or selling the house or whatever for her and then just giving her a referral fee. And obviously you can't do that if you're not an active agent. So she just wanted to remain active and I was like, yeah, sure, whatever, you know, do, do, do, do what you need to do. I'm not, I'm not super, I'm not, I'm very flexible when it comes to, you know, thinking a little bit outside the box. And then another agent, and I didn't really even think to tell the brokerage, I mean, the association that that's what was going on. I mean, I was just like, I wasn't really fully aware myself on the way that worked because I'd only been sponsoring agents at that point for like four years. So it had never been an issue where I had to, you know, like, never sponsored or not a member before. And then another agent approached me that was going to get an employment with a apartment complex down in Dallas area. And they required that this agent have an active license. She wasn't going to be doing any real estate, but she needed to have her active license in order to do leasing for whatever company she was working for. She was an in-house leasing agent essentially, right. But she needed an active real estate license to sponsor her because. But because you're a brokerage, they have to be members, right. And like I said, right. Well, like I said, I didn't really under, I didn't really know that that was a thing, you know, like my broker never told me that. He just told me you have to be a part of the association. And he never really explained all the background behind it. I mean, that's a lot of problem with our industries. We don't really educate everybody on how it works. And even a lot of agents nowadays don't understand what those forms like I learned all of these things through this journey. And I'm telling now everybody that I can that I come across is like those forms because everybody's complaining about them. And I keep telling everybody those forms are not required. So you need to make sure that you tell your agents or tell you, you know, you remember it's not mandatory by the state, by the state that we're in. It's not by law required that you sign those forms. If you don't want to, if you don't want to use them, you can use something else. And so let's go back to the two agents that were. Yes, I sponsor. I sponsor. I kept them in my in my roster and I didn't, I heard some, I got an email from my association. They in that tar had notified them of two non members that had. So the state and tar is the state association association of REALTORS. Yeah. I had notified them that I had two non members, which to me is also like what the hell. So basically you had one agent that was just doing referrals really not participating other than to live in area. Right. Just said, hey, I have a friend who needs help and passed the lead to someone. And then you had another agent who goes, no, I just have to have this somewhere, but I'm not doing any actual transactions. Any transactions I work in house for a company that owns the building or manages the building. I work in and I'm in a different area, but I still have to have it active in a legal in order for me to be able to do these. And so the state says, hey, we noticed these two people aren't members of your local association. The local comes back to you and says what? And basically says that they need them to come in and fill out an application and fill and pay all these fees. Or I need to unsponsor them. So I need to fire them or I need to make them pay. Right. And I was like, for me, I was like, what gives you the authority to do something like that to tell me how to run my business and who I can hire and fire or sponsor or not sponsor. But that was my initial reaction to it. And then they were like, and then, you know, so it went from there. They explained that it's in the bylaws and all this stuff and showed me where it was in the bylaws. And it was just so confusing because it's really not in the bylaws, like as clearly as concise as they made it sound. Like it says that yes, it does say that the broker is responsible for every sales to pay for the the association. And you'll do this for every sales person in the firm. Now that's about as clear as it gets. And to me, that leaves a lot for interpretation. You know, like are you talking about the firm within the jurisdiction of the bylaws, which is only six counties. So then the ones in Houston and for a worth wouldn't apply. And if if it to, you know, if jurisdiction doesn't matter, then why wouldn't Oklahoma also fall under the same thing because they're with my firm. I have a brokerage license over there. And they're all under strategic realty. So that's still under the umbrella of the firm. Do I have to pay for them to be a part of our association? You know, like there's there's a lot of ambiguity in our bylaws as it's written. And and then it's not clear what the punitive damages are. Like it says that I'm supposed to notify them of any non members, but it doesn't say if if I don't report them what happens. And so they get to choose how they punish me for not reporting these members. And like, but so they just and rather than having a conversation or trying to work with with us as members, they just go straight to punishment. You know, like it just it was very punitive the way that they treated the whole situation. And it did it lacked any any any outside thinking, you know, like they did I told them what what what happened. I explained to them what the situation was back in May. And I asked him to go to the board and see if they would either do a waiver or have some sort of exception to this this situation. And in in August, the last day of August, I got an email with an invoice from the board saying that they they voted and that I needed to pay for both that they weren't going to give me a waiver and that I needed to pay for both of those agents. Going back to the date of sponsorship and it wound up being like $3,500 for the annual dues, MLS dues, the MLS fees, the Century Lock fees, the application fees, the membership startup fees, you know, like everything was included from Kittenkbull, even though they never applied, they never participated, they never accessed any of the benefits of the services, you know, like it was just totally backwards like and then to boot, they threatened that to take me out the term and name my membership, which was coercive and almost like this racketeering kind of, you know, feeling when I went it just it upset me to the point where I almost just said, well, you know, fuck it, sue me, you know, kind of thing. But then I, you know, I thought about it and I didn't want to it basically it would have it would have shut me down. Right, you would have affected. You would have affected all your other agents. Right, because because that's where the tie-in comes in. They make it to where the filter right it makes it the way that they have it set up, they make it so that it's required for us to be a part of the association regardless of whether or not we sponsor agent, you know, like regardless of the fact that the agents have their own membership. So it ties us all into this big huge lump. I have to get a membership here at WFAR if I have agents that want access to MLS here. I have to get my I have to be a part of the association in Denton. If any of the agents that I sponsor want MLS access down in Denton, I also have to, so I have to be a part of every single one of these little associations regardless of whether I'm in the in the area. But obviously, which shelf always is going to be my primary. Right. So it ties me into all of these little agents. And you feel you've even used stronger language where you feel that it is in a sense a reverse pyramid scheme. Absolutely. I mean, because they're they're getting enriched from me. They're getting money from me instead of me bringing money into the business via having people sign up. It's costing me every time I sign somebody up. So that to me is a reverse pyramid scheme. But. And so what ended up happening with the your local association issue? Well, like I said, they threatened to terminate my membership if I didn't pay it by a ex date or whatever. And it happened to fall like right around Thanksgiving. And that created, you know, a lot of anxiety for me. So I just wanted to pay in the invoice under under dress even though the the way that they did it violated even their own process in the bylaws. Like they they didn't I disputed the invoice and it didn't change. It didn't change the clock, you know, like in the in the bylaws, it states that on I think this is pretty much an everyone that you if you don't pay an invoice by the third month, like they hadn't even invoiced me at the beginning. Like the the whole time between May when they notified me of these nonmembers, they didn't send me an invoice at that point. So it's not like there was any any financial obligations that I was pending at that point even. We were just having a discussion about the membership themselves, the members themselves. They didn't invoice me until the end of August. And at that point, they invoiced me for everything rather than just for the annual dues. And they claimed that that because it was too late, that I'd already violated their blah blah blah blah blah. You know, like, if there was an option to only pay the annual dues, why didn't you send me that invoice and then wait until I declined to to pay that invoice before escalating it further. You just went straight to escalation. And then they took it to the board before they even gave me the invoice to dispute. Like they made all of these decisions about penalties and and and fines and stuff before I even got there. You know, so to me, it felt very very punitive, very very unfair. Like it wasn't it was just it was just the wrong way that they they basically you felt that it was a shut up and pay us. Right. It's just it was just a very coercive money grabbing opportunity for them and they went all out. And so with all of the issues you're you're sort of bringing to the table. Actually, before we get to sort of let me let me finish that portion of it. So basically by then I had actually already unsponsored these two agents because now I'm afraid they're going to keep continuing to charge me this stuff and I'm not going to pay that. So basically I had to fire them. And now going forward, I just I was not able to to sponsor anybody that didn't want to be a part of the association. So tying my ability to increase my revenue. So you feel it's limiting. So from the top down, you feel it's so intertwined and so just rigid that you as a business owner are limited in what you can and can't do. And that's telling me how to run my business. Yeah. Even though they claim that it's not mandatory. And but but even though it's not mandatory, they tie it also into MLS access. And that's number three, if they if they if they had no tie into MLS access, they then this would be an issue. If I want something as essential as MLS because MLS is essential for all of us is role jurors, all of us is real estate agents. That's essential to our business. If they tie, if they untied that, then this wouldn't have been an issue. I don't think. Yeah, so you're looking at one real quick. Let me rethink that one real quick because I do think that MLS is it MLS has its its benefits obviously, but having it at just a local level is very uninclusive. Sure. People outside that area. Right. Right. But however, you know, if we want access to it, them tying it into the memberships is is also, you know, bad for us as it's also an overreach, I think, in the business sense of free trade and and teacher's laws and whatnot. And so you feel that the problem starts all the way at the top top being NAR as the sort of supreme parent company or the parent association. And tell us what you're doing right now. What how are you what would you rather what would you like to see done and they'll start there? What would what would you like to see changed? Well, and this goes back to I've been doing a lot of research on the lawsuits that have that have occurred in the in the country over the years. And back in the 80s, there was a lot I'm a pretty big lawsuit that changed the way that NAR treated MLS because back at the beginning NAR did have control over MLS and they got sued in the 1980s. And so they said that they won't have any for monopolistic and antitrust laws and stuff like that. I think it was in California where they got sued. But so that's when they pushed MLS to be at a local level, controlled at a local level instead of at a NAR level. So a lot of these responses that we're getting is that NAR doesn't require that you have MLS access in order to be a part of the association because technically they don't. But when they tie themselves into the local association, then by default, they're requiring it. Because the local association. So you feel that that's like a sneaky way to get what they want. Right. They said, okay, so we won't have control over it the local associations every time that they have a lawsuit. And if you go back and you look at all of these lawsuits that they've had over the years, instead of changing the way they parent or the primary directive is at their level, they push it down to the local level. Everything like MLS, the the the do's and fees that are set by the local association, the everything that they've been sued for has been pushed back. Even the now new one, they've pushed it down to where it's now at a level where the MLS, which is controlled by the local board, controls how MLS deals with the commission. Interesting. So you feel like they're passing their path. They're passing the buck. Yeah, they're passing the buck down below. But they're so basically they're they're not changing really. They're just not requiring it anymore. So they're turning it down to the boards done locally for them to require it. Because they have to approve the bylaws of all the associations to make sure that it is in line with their mandates. Yeah, it's interesting. I've I felt that that was a I found that to be confusing when they when NAR came out and said, well, you don't have to be a member. But to my knowledge, the vast majority of local and state associations are members. So and you there isn't another option really. Right. So why not just say, yeah, actually, I mean, why not be transparent, I guess, about that. Right. And they're all about transparency, right? So do you think that this is there's a systemic issue that that needs to be open. And it needs to be overhauled. Do you think they should be just erased altogether? You know, what are your thoughts? Well, I mean, you can do either one. Either one is going to be beneficial for the industry. The the only reason why I still think that NAR I want to give NAR a chance to do the right thing is because they do have the reach. A lot of agents, the reason why they don't come forward or they don't speak out is because they are afraid to rock the status of the status quo. They're afraid to change those things that they like about it. Or they're afraid to lose access to M less, which is the primary reason why we go with a lot of these associations in the first place. Yeah. Excuse me. So or they're, you know, like we change our every time we change the way things do business, they have to rethink their own strategies as far as how they gain customers. And you know, like change is not is not very easy for anybody, especially the older generation of REALTORS that have been doing this since the beginning of time. And or might be a little bit more technologically inclined. I mean, a challenged. There's a lot of fear that they're that they don't want to change. So if NAR made the changes on their end, it would be easier for the industry than getting rid of them all together and starting from scratch. You know what I mean? Because how many how how fast would that be? It would take so much longer for everybody to veer from the thinking that NAR is is good. So the amount of control that NAR has right now is would be beneficial for the membership because they could change everything if tomorrow, you know, like that. And why do you think they is it you feel they I'm curious to get your answer for why you think they don't make those changes? Is it because that you feel that they can just push it down down the down the line to the state don't want to lose control. They don't want to lose the control. You know, like that or or or it's a failure of a it's a failure of imagination. They they they have all the control right now and they say, well, you know, this is how it is. And if you guys don't like it, then you know, tough find another way to do it. And guess what? There's really not a another way to do it. Right. And so then they don't have then they have to sit then they can sit back and do nothing because nobody so it's twofold really. If they refuse, then we must as an industry terminate them. So I would like to give not on opportunity to make these changes, to have an overhaul. But we don't have the time to sit around and and and wait for them to come to their senses. We have to make them come to their senses. Or we have to change our way of doing business now. I foresee in five years, we could be the next travel agents. Are you worried? You're worried about being replaced by technology. Right. Totally. I mean, the amount of AI interaction in our lives right now is astronomical. It is it is something that is not and it is not being talked about. This idea that yes, we yes, agents have value and they should be compensated. I don't think anyone would disagree who is who is an agent. If you don't think you have value, then you should get out. But that's not the conversation that we need to be having. Right. You need to be having the conversation that how are we going to compete? Yes. In the future of this industry, not that we don't have value and that we shouldn't expect to get paid, that's going to happen. We need to stop worrying about that and we need to worry about how we're going to keep the business. Yeah. What happens when AI? So it's funny. I ask GVT all sorts of problems that I can't figure out. And within five seconds, it has been answered for me. It's not always accurate. But what happens when AI is going to be better at negotiating because it has access to billions of data points than any human being ever could. How critical and again, it's not that's not the only value an agent provides. Obviously, we know that. But there's going to be a lot of people that are going to rely upon or in any even check their agents recommendations. And we are human. We're prone to that. Of course, of course. And that is going to create a challenge to keep the perception of value. The reason why we tell people to use this as agents is because we're telling them that we are the experts that we know how this is work going to work. And that this the process of buying home is so stressful that you need us to be able to make that big purchase less difficult. And if they can go on to chat GPT and just type in how do I buy a house and it tells them everything that they need to know, even gives them all the forms, gives them all the data that they need. Then what do they need us for? If we don't make ourselves indispensable to the industry, then we're going to be dispensed. And how do you think how do you think we can make ourselves indispensable? We need to create better processes, better ways of doing the business that we do. Whether I mean, right now everything is like the Wild West out there. There's so many different products. There's so many different CRMs. There's so many different like brokermet and zip forms and dot loop and all this other stuff. I'm not saying that we need to create a monolithic program, but we need to bring something together to where like my vision, if NAR had any vision, they would have created a platform with Realtor.com as the consumers side and then a platform for the agent side of that. And it would have been all inclusive to include like a showing service that we could pay for, you know, like levels. That's what I envision that the future is going to be. It's going to be a membership style MLS service. Kind of like one that already exists right now that is used by a lot of the local agents in a lot of these rural areas and even some bigger areas like New York is my state MLS. I'm not sure if you're familiar with that. But if you log into their platform and you pay their $45 a month, you have access to all the state forms pretty much for every state in the country because it's national. You have access to national listings everywhere. You have access to marketing material that you can use and they produce this every month with new ideas, new canva backgrounds, new little quips that you can customize a little bit here and post it on your social media. They also provide add-ons for showing services. They also and it's inexpensive and they're very, very communicative. Anytime that you have a problem or an issue or whatever, you just send them a text or give them a call and they're there. Well, I'm surprised too that maybe the lessons learned from what Zilla was able to do in the early 2000s when they came on to the scene and said, we're a tech company and we understand human behavior and we're going to create a very appealing product that's totally free for the consumer that bypasses the gatekeeper, the agent because we're going to basically pull all those listings and now they're a broker in every state so they because they're an MLS member, they get those listings and also we're going to value each home that's out there and they have created, I think the Zilla touches over 90% of all real estate transactions now. And if they created a platform for MLS, then NAR would be done because it would be almost a game over scenario. Yeah, if they created their own back end MLS plug-in, I guess is what you would call it, it would be over and they could charge the brokers a little membership fee or whatever and then we wouldn't need any of the services of NAR on tar. It's really funny because every single one of these associations have their own level of benefits and services and they're, obviously now as members we're starting to see which one provides us with the most and NAR, I've logged into NAR twice in probably 15 years. I don't know why I even, they're even necessary at this point. I don't know what services they provide anymore. They used to provide discounts and I mean really the only thing that they provide is the acronyms that people can you can call yourself a REALTOR. Yeah and you can call and you can you've earned the right to call yourself a REALTOR for $156 a year. And to their credit, they also have a powerful lobbying or part arm of their organization for the industry. Right but lobbying hasn't really paid much and dividends to us at this point. Yeah that's debatable about what the effectiveness of that lobbyists are when you know with a $420 million payout. Exactly. Yeah. As a member, how did you feel about obviously you felt that their reaction to losing lawsuit was a bit of an overreach and decoupling the commissions and making it a little bit more challenging for agents in your opinion to have those conversations and maybe more challenging for first time home buyers. All the different forms that they added to our repertoire is just more is more cumbersome and confusing. It makes it very confusing for these agents especially the older ones. I mean the younger ones are going to get used to it because it's all that they're going to know. But the change that it created for the older ones is getting to be a really big burden for a lot of brokers. And it probably creates a lot of anxiety and broker owners like yourself because you're ultimately responsible for everything the agents do. Yeah and I mean a lot of it's unnecessary and and it's not always succeeding. It's actually causing like the one that Carla, Carla's lawsuit over in Louisiana. She had an experience where one of her agents lost a $15,000 commission because one of her buyers went and saw a property that was being shown as a open house. And when they went to the open house, the listing agent had them sign a buyer's rep. Yeah. Just to see the property. Which is not necessary, which was completely not necessary. It's not part of, but it was permissible. And so, you know, like based on the interpretation of the rules, they're saying, you know, we have to make everybody sign a buyer's rep whenever they want to see one of our houses. And that's not part, that's not a requirement. You so it's like they didn't they just haven't explained the rules succinctly enough that people are getting it. And they're taking advantage of the ambiguity in a lot of ways. And they have to be losing membership because people are just leaving the industry in in droves. And yes, of course, there's a lot of factors that contribute to that. You know, the rates are obviously higher than a lot of agents would prefer and buyers would prefer. Listings are a lot of us are just, you know, I would love to know what I would love to see NAR addresses. What are what are about the 85% of American homeowners that have a like sub 4% loan? Like what's good? Like that's a huge problem. And you know, if somebody doesn't come up with a product or a solution to encourage, I mean, we can just wait for people to have to move. And that's of course kind of what we're doing now. What for close years, you mean? Well, no, I just mean, you know, life events, people have to move or they decide to move. But boy, you know, again, I'm not blaming NAR for this. I'm just hoping that they could say, you know, we've got a real problem here. There's a huge bottleneck that we're going to see in the next few years for listings. If we don't sort of figure out a motivation for a lent for, you know, a borrower to take a much higher rate. And I don't know what that solution is. But we sort of all just go, well, it is kind of what it is. And that's true. It is what it is. But someone needs to be working on a solution to this because so many people are hamstrung. So many owners are hamstrung going, well, I don't want to double my payment to live in the same type of property or it's of the same value. If I sell and repurchase again, I'm going to be like twice as what you're, you know, paying in the same way. Yeah. Yeah. Well, the only solution to that is going to be to for the interest rights to go down. They need to go back down to something that's a little bit more comprehensive. And I think that with the, I'm hoping that with the new administration and that a lot of the issues, a lot of the overblown prices is going to kind of level out and we're going to be able to get back to 4%. I mean, I don't think that we'll get back to 2%. But you know, something a little bit more accommodating and a little bit more reasonable. Even if it goes down to only 4% would be would be great for the consumer. Well, you have laid out your grievances with the associations at all levels. I think it's been a really interesting conversation. So let me just add in there the second invoice that they sent me, which is the one that actually put me over the edge and had me going into the lawsuits is really the one that that we haven't talked about. But just very quickly on that one, that one was the second agent that he was already an agent before and he just wanted to reactivate his license so that he could do some stuff part time and he's down and forward. And I'm a part of the association down there in Denton and I told him, you know, like I'm a part of this association. So once I sponsor you just go over there and fill out their application. However, I never heard from him again. You know, and this was like right at COVID time frame. Sure, I was extremely busy and he never spoke to me again. He never was part of any of our meetings. He was never asked for access to the platform. I gave him access, but he never to like my back end platform, but he never finished the onboarding process or whatever. And I never heard from him again. And I just totally forgot about it. Well, I get the same thing. I get an email from them stating that there's a non-member reported, but with this email, they automatically sent me an invoice immediately for the $1,700, which was all the fees. The fees, the application, the MLS dues, I mean, MLS quarterly fees and annual fees. So now you're going through the same situation, but a different process. Right. And so now you're like, well, there's not even consistency within the process. Right. So they sent me an invoice right off the bat. And I disputed it at that point. And I called up the director. And he's like, well, you've done this before. So that's why we went, you know, like you've you've already been more. So I was like, well, I'm not paying it. And guess what now? And this was right. Right after the settlement. So I was already agreed by it because of that. And I was like, you know what? I'm just going to take you guys to small claims because this is bull crap. I don't know if you can swear on your thing, but you know, I got the okay. I got I suffer from a little bit of the cursi words. Friendship or addiction. I try to keep myself clean because I'm doing all these podcasts, but sometimes it's just it's a better a better way to communicate. But anyway, so I went to small claims and filed there and had them served. And that was back in August of last year. Now, in November, I get an email from the board from him saying that the board voted on the invoice that I'd been sent, even though I disputed it or whatever, I never really had much of a chance to actually talk to anybody at the board about it. I that they voted that it was valid and that if I didn't pay, I got the I got the letter on the 22nd of November. And then I had to pay by November 5th December 5th. No, November 5th. I mean, November 27th. Sorry, I got I got the invoice by November 22nd on November 20th. You had a five day window. And right, right. And I had a five day window to pay this invoice of $1,700. And that just like, you know, I contacted a couple of lawyers in the area and nobody really wants to get involved in it. Nobody, you know, like lawyers aren't exactly kind of like us where we just kind of want stuff done now and and times of the essence. And you know, I've got an emergency here. They're about to kick me out. They're about to like affect my business right at Thanksgiving. Again, you know, one year later. And and at this point, I'm just done. So I had spoken to a couple of agents. I mean, not an agent, a couple of attorneys. And they had mentioned when I when I went to the class action, they immediately hired an attorney. So, you know, I mean, when somebody else, the other party hires an attorney, especially in small claims, I don't know why they hired an attorney. But and it's obviously our dues that are going to be paying for it. When they did that, I went and I talked to a couple of attorneys in town and none of them wanted to deal with it because they felt like they do a lot of business with local REALTORS in town and they didn't want to lose their own business by defending me in this case. And so I went outside the area a little bit and most of the attorneys that I spoke to said that it probably should have been filed in federal court not in small claims because if I was going to charge them with anti violations or violations of the Sherman Act and the anti trust act, that was more of a federal issue. Small claims would have only been able to handle anything that I paid. So that invoiced the invoice that I that I had paid already was valid. But the one that I hadn't paid, I had to take to federal court. So I went ahead and because of that email, I went ahead and put together a complaint based on like I went and I looked at all the other complaints that had already been filed by then because I already the Michigan one, the class action at Michigan and filed, it was one in California and there was one in Pennsylvania that had been filed. And I kind of hodged, paged mine to have the same language and issues as theirs, including the invoice of the $1,700, not $3,500 one because that one was going to be dealt with in small claims. But the $1,700 one was the one that I included in the federal and I asked for an injunctive relief to keep them from just you know, terminating my membership. That was the important part because small claims couldn't give me like a restraining order or anything like that. And and that's that's one of the reasons why that was the primary reason why I filed it in the first place was because I was I was at I was in in danger of losing my business right before Christmas. And I just couldn't I just couldn't take it anymore. I was like, no, you guys have totally you tell you you you went one step too far. And and the sad part about it is that these are fed for the the board is made up of my fellow agents. Right. So these are other people in town that are voting. So it felt very punitive. It felt like, oh, you know, your competition is voting my competition is voting against to close me down. And I'm not that I'm not the big I'm not the big Kuhna in town. Most of the people that are on the board are on the in those big ones. And if we look at the actual reason why these agents weren't paying, it was because they're not in the area or they're not accessing. Yeah, they're the level of harm versus the benefits to the to the association is is totally skewed on my side. Like the harm is on me. To them, it won't cost it doesn't cost them anything. It just enriches them. It just it just gives them more to the you to the coffers of their organization. To me, it closes my doors. And that is is a violation of my rights as a business owner. That's it. Gross overreach of their power. Well, well, well argued and and very interesting point I'm interested to continue to follow, you know, your your case at the federal level and see, you know, what happens. We're obviously watching all the lawsuits. And it's very interesting to see where where things are headed. I'm seeing like right now we're still at the beginnings of everything. So there's not really much to report. But if you if they want to get more information as we go, they can access that Facebook page because every time I have to respond or I get a response from them from from the the courts or whatever, I try and keep everybody up to date on that. And so far, the only response that we've gotten is a motion to dismiss, which I've I've responded to. They're trying to get it dismissed on with prejudice. Oh, and we just finished the small claims a couple days ago as well. Oh, how did that go? Um, it was interesting. It was definitely practiced for me because, uh, you know, if I don't win, I'll chalk it up to practice. And I might I might take it to appeal. If I don't win, um, just depends on if they award them attorneys fees because they're asking for like $9800 in the attorney's fees. Well, so if they if they go that, if I if it goes that route, then more than likely, then I will appeal it. Um, the judge hasn't ruled on it yet. Like the court, the case itself, we just presented our case at this point. And he's going to be ruling on it probably either. He said that it would probably be next week before I hear anything. But as far as the case is concerned, I think that I laid out my case fairly succinctly and it was based my basis was just the fairness of it all. And the fact that the bylaws are not clear and concise and any ambiguity based on the there's a there's a statute. It's called the restatement of contract section 206. That states that any ambiguity in a contract must be interpreted against the party who wrote the contract. So any ambiguity in the contract itself in the bylaws must be interpreted against them. And I pointed out several places in the bylaws that it's just ambiguous and not clear. The jurisdiction issue itself is not clear because it does state that they're they only have jurisdiction over six counties. So is it jurisdiction over me? Do you restriction over the agents jurisdiction over the firm? You know, like is there is there a cutoff? And if there isn't a cutoff, then why does other states not apply? You know, like there's there's there's way too many questions to be had. Another ambiguity is that there is no provisions in the bylaws for real clear that that they clearly had the right to do the things that they did. Like yes, it does say that I'm what within 10 days I must help them about any nonmembers in my firm, but it doesn't say what the punitive damage you know, like what the punishments would be if I don't. So like it doesn't it doesn't give them it doesn't turn around and give them the authority to go and bill me $3,500 and then threaten to terminate me if I don't pay it doesn't give them that authority. Well, for all of our listeners who are interested in you know, following lose cases at the local and the federal level, as well as just you know, wanting to support her mission. They we she has two ways you can do that. There's a Facebook group. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. And there is also a go fund me where you can contribute to the defense fund to that she is mounting and for the cost associated with, you know, taking on, you know, the industry associations. So and those those things are also for other agents to like if they if there's other agents that have similar issues that they need help with. I'm more than happy to give them, you know, my experience and let them decide what they want to do at that point. If they want to be a part of the Texas lawsuit, they can also reach out to me and I can see what I can do on that. If they want to start their own lawsuit, that would be also, you know, a good place for them to go to get some information about how to go about it. And also anything that's raised in that go fund me if it's above and beyond what I might need, which I'm sure. Right now I'm hoping that it is so that I can also help other people and other lawsuits that are already out there. Fund to their attorneys and get the assistance that they need in order to be successful. As ultimately we want this to we want the change. We need the change in this industry otherwise we are going to be the next travel agents. Well, we're going the way the dodo bird y'all. I appreciate your perspective. I appreciate the courage it takes to talk about something like this. I think that that is not an easy ask for anyone. It's also not any it's an easy ask. Actually everyone's got an opinion about it. But for somebody to take action is and to be publicly taking action while running a business that is seemingly in conflict with, you know, with some of the issues that you're addressing is. I'm finding that yeah, I'm finding that there is a lot of people that are out there that support the efforts that I'm doing and are like you they applaud the efforts or, you know, they understand the courage that it takes. But I would just state that it doesn't take a lot of courage to do this. It just takes a minute to say enough is enough. You know, I mean, I don't feel like I'm a trendsetter or anything like that. I feel like I just, you know, I'm just that fed up with it. And we need to not be afraid to speak up because otherwise we can't complain. We can't complain about the way things go. It's a good point and it's easy to complain and it's not as easy to sort of, you know, request change from the people that can make those changes. And so, and ultimately I also feel like if they're, if not and and all of these associations really intend to be. Supportive of our mission, our businesses, they will make the change. The way that they react to all of these lawsuits is going to be very indicative of how much they are actually working for us. I think I feel like, you know, if they, if they don't, I'm not saying settle. I'm not saying, you know, make us go away and give us money. I'm saying the change because most of us don't want to settle. Most of you want to just, you want to keep running your business. Yeah, we want to see the change. We want to be a beat, beat, beat, run our businesses better. So I don't see that this is going to go away just by throwing money at it. So they're going to, they're going to have to make that hard choice. Are they going to be supportive of what we're telling them that we need or are they going to just make it go away. And continue with their, with their bad acts. Perfectly summed up. And for all of those that want to continue to support Lou and her efforts, the Facebook group and the GoFundMe are in our show notes. And also we encourage, I would love to have a conversation also with someone at NAR to, you know, sort of talk about what changes they're working on to maybe address some of these concerns. We will be hopefully coming with a future episode with someone representative there that can give us a little bit more insight into what they're with their. I would love to, I would love to hear what their ideas are. And I'm more than happy to collaborate with anybody at NAR if they want more ideas on how they can improve our industry because we're on the, we're the boots on the ground. You know, we're the ones that actually do the work. We're the ones that are actually down in the trenches and we know what we're facing on a daily basis. And we can, we can tell them very distinctly what we need in order to improve the industry. They need to start listening to us. Otherwise, we're going to, we're going to get rid of them. Well, I really appreciate Louie coming on. We talked for, we had a great long conversation. I appreciate your willingness to share with my audience your perspective. And also I know we have tens of thousands of listeners. So for those of you that want to continue or want to support Lou, you know, we have those links in the show notes. And also, yeah, and we, and behalf of our audience, we thank you for your time. Also on behalf of Lou and myself, we thank the audience for sticking around to the end. We appreciate you as listeners or viewers. Please, as always, the best way that you can help us continue to grow is by telling another REALTOR about this podcast. You know, everyone's got an opinion about the, the changes that have been happening. This might be an episode to share with them to see to get their thoughts because perhaps they would have, you know, thoughts that were either consistent or, or, or not with Lou, but at least, you know, they know this conversation is happening. And I think conversation, as I said at the beginning, is always good. It always can lead to, to, you know, improvements. So whatever improvements, if it need to be made, they need to happen through dialogue. So I appreciate you, Lou, sharing your, your perspective. I'm very excited to hopefully bring someone from an AR on to talk about their perspective and just continue to provide the audience, you know, with, with information they can make up their own minds. So we appreciate you. Thank you so much for coming on and on behalf of all of us, you know, we thank our, our guest Lou and we thank you the audience for continuing to support us. And we will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks Lou. Thank you.
