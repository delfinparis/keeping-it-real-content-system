[00:01:30] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by Real
[00:01:35] Estate Agents and four real estate agents.
[00:01:38] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:01:39] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:01:42] By the way, we just celebrated.
[00:01:43] The only reason I know this is LinkedIn told me, but we just celebrated our sixth year
[00:01:48] doing this podcast.
[00:01:50] So, I just wanted to say thank you to everyone listening right now.
[00:01:53] And of course, everyone that has ever listened to our show, we have millions of downloads, tens
[00:01:58] of thousands of regular listeners.
[00:02:00] And we could not be more grateful to all of you when I started this six years ago.
[00:02:05] I had like three listeners and they were, you know, my family.
[00:02:08] So, I am glad that it has spread beyond that.
[00:02:10] And we are about to be speaking with Kathy Le Mans, top producer.
[00:02:15] But before we get to Kathy, please help us continue to grow.
[00:02:18] Let's go another six years.
[00:02:19] But I want to reach twice as many agents as we have.
[00:02:22] There's 1.5 million realters out there.
[00:02:26] Not all of them know about this show.
[00:02:27] So please help us out.
[00:02:29] Let other agents know about this show.
[00:02:31] Everybody wants to learn from top producers.
[00:02:34] So let's let them know that this exists.
[00:02:35] And it's free.
[00:02:37] And also please support our sponsors.
[00:02:39] They are paying the bills and we love our sponsors.
[00:02:42] So please check them out by their products and services and tell other people about them
[00:02:47] as well.
[00:02:48] All right, guys, let's get to the main event.
[00:02:50] Happy 6th birthday to all of us and birthday, I guess anniversary, whatever.
[00:02:55] Happy 6th to all of us listening.
[00:02:57] And let's get to the main event, my conversation with Kathy Le Mans.
[00:03:13] Today on the show, we have Kathy Le Mans with Keller Williams in Atlanta.
[00:03:19] Let me tell you more about Kathy.
[00:03:21] Now Kathy Le Mans began selling a real estate in 1992 after leaving the corporate world
[00:03:27] of IBM sales where they were offering incentives to downsize their workforce.
[00:03:32] Kathy took advantage of that and joined a locally owned brokerage with about 500 agents
[00:03:37] and set to learn all that she could by attending trainings and conferences all over the country.
[00:03:44] Now, 2001, she was given the opportunity to invest in a new Keller Williams office in Buckhead
[00:03:49] where she has been ever since.
[00:03:52] And she has a small team consisting of herself, her husband, and a full-time licensed operations
[00:03:58] manager.
[00:03:59] And their goal this year is to help 42 families build a life they love.
[00:04:04] And her average price point is about $750,000.
[00:04:08] And she works, her and her team work predominantly by referral.
[00:04:12] I want everybody to visit Kathy's website because not only is she our guest and we should
[00:04:19] always support our guests.
[00:04:20] But she's a really beautiful looking website.
[00:04:23] Lamontime.com L-A-M-O-N team.com.
[00:04:26] You can also find links to all of her social channels there.
[00:04:30] We will post links to that in our show notes as well.
[00:04:33] But Lamontime.com is where you go to learn about Kathy and her team.
[00:04:37] Kathy, welcome to the show.
[00:04:39] Thank you, DJ.
[00:04:40] I'm glad to be here.
[00:04:41] Thanks for your glad you're here as well.
[00:04:45] It's funny when you were thinking about your bio.
[00:04:48] And I actually was in Buckhead in 2001 with Anheuser Bush.
[00:04:53] I was, they were having their conference in Atlanta and they had rented out a good, a number
[00:04:59] of the Buckhead bars for this conference.
[00:05:02] The conference was at the CNN Center or I don't know what it's technically called, but
[00:05:06] over there, downtown.
[00:05:07] 
[00:05:07] And then in Buckhead was, they had all these fun nighttime activities.
[00:05:11] And then I went back and visited Buckhead, mentally, I don't know, five or six years later.
[00:05:17] And it had really blossomed.
[00:05:19] And even now it's obviously blossomed even further.
[00:05:22] But what a fun area to have in office.
[00:05:25] You picked a great location in the Atlanta Metro.
[00:05:27] It is a great location.
[00:05:29] Fun things to do, a lot of good restaurants, great people, and never a dull moment in Buckhead.
[00:05:36] Lots of fun to be had and it is really a fun place to visit.
[00:05:41] So if you haven't, if you haven't ever been to Atlanta, go to the world of Coke and go
[00:05:46] visit Buckhead.
[00:05:49] I think it's called World of Coke.
[00:05:51] It is.
[00:05:51] It is.
[00:05:52] There's a beautiful Georgia Aquarium right next door to that.
[00:05:56] So it's a great place to bring families and good place to visit.
[00:06:01] Well, I love Atlanta.
[00:06:03] So Kathy, I would, you know, I understand you were in really the IT world.
[00:06:07] You were in sales before when you were at IBM.
[00:06:10] And I understand you had an opportunity to take a nice exit package and then decide to
[00:06:15] switch to careers.
[00:06:16] Why did you decide to switch careers to real estate?
[00:06:19] Well, at the time, I had little kids and thought, oh, real estate.
[00:06:25] You know, you can kind of set your own hours, do your own thing.
[00:06:28] I'll try real estate.
[00:06:30] Well, anybody that's in the business knows that, yes, you are very flexible unless you
[00:06:36] have a client, especially an out of town client.
[00:06:39] And then your time is there time.
[00:06:41] But it did work out well to just be able to pick up my daughters a little bit more often
[00:06:46] and just give me the opportunity to be a mom a little bit more often.
[00:06:53] So it was a good move.
[00:06:56] And I, you know, I loved IBM.
[00:06:59] It was a great place to learn.
[00:07:01] It was a great place to start my career.
[00:07:03] I came with them right out of college.
[00:07:06] And what I've realized about real estate is there's even so much more growth opportunity,
[00:07:13] both personally in terms of training and growth opportunities there as well as income.
[00:07:20] IBM kept me, I was on commission, but if you sold too much too early in the year, they
[00:07:26] would just raise your quota and you'd be back making the same money.
[00:07:29] So it was, it was very tightly controlled and real estate, you know, this, as people say,
[00:07:36] the sky's the limit and that there is no ceiling and no floor, but it's a great business.
[00:07:43] It is.
[00:07:44] And I also too want to put this in perspective because when you started the world, I mean,
[00:07:49] obviously the world changes every year, but it really has changed since when you started,
[00:07:54] you were pre-internet.
[00:07:55] So we're talking 1992.
[00:07:57] I mean, technically the internet was sort of around, but not, certainly wasn't adopted by the public.
[00:08:03] And I remember I went to college in 1994 and that was the first time that we started seeing web
[00:08:10] browsers and the ability to sort of, and it still wasn't widely used.
[00:08:15] So you were, I'm guessing we were on the phone a lot, which people who did not go up pre-1994,
[00:08:23] they don't know how to use the phone.
[00:08:25] They don't use the phone today.
[00:08:26] They don't communicate that way with their friends.
[00:08:29] I still think the phone is a really great way to communicate with people and it's kind of a bit
[00:08:36] of a lost art now, but I do think that, and even though people may not be as accustomed to being
[00:08:43] on the phone as they once were, I think we have this yearning to actually interact a voice to
[00:08:49] obviously we could do FaceTime and there's ways to do voice and picture at the same time.
[00:08:54] But I imagine you probably still pick up the phone quite a bit.
[00:08:57] Is that a fail?
[00:08:58] I do, as a matter of fact, I'd set a goal to make 10 calls every day and a lot of those
[00:09:05] end up being voicemail and you know, there's always this question, should I leave a voicemail,
[00:09:11] should I not?
[00:09:12] And I just choose to leave the voicemail.
[00:09:14] I think if someone does take the time, it's nice for them to hear my voice and maybe it's a little
[00:09:20] more personal.
[00:09:21] I use text a lot too though.
[00:09:26] There is something to be said about a phone call and that's also one of the nice things about
[00:09:31] being on the phone these days is you are going to get a lot of voicemails because you know,
[00:09:35] you get to choose now who you want to speak to and it's really, I think, made the phone a lot
[00:09:41] easier to use as a...
[00:09:42] I agree.
[00:09:43] Because you're like, well, I'm probably going to get a voicemail and then you get to leave
[00:09:46] a lovely message and my thought in Kathy, I know you're right, it's like, are they even going to
[00:09:51] hear the message?
[00:09:52] I think most people listen.
[00:09:55] I don't know.
[00:09:56] I mean, I'd be curious to see stats on this because maybe I'd be wrong, but I, it depends on the age
[00:10:01] range, I think.
[00:10:02] Yeah, but if you're listening to our podcast, you're a REALTOR.
[00:10:05] You should be listening to your voicemails because there may be some business in there.
[00:10:09] But I understand the idea of like, God, am I just wasting my time leaving voicemails?
[00:10:14] I don't think so because, for example, Kathy, if you called me on my birthday to wish me a happy
[00:10:19] birthday, for example, you just, it came up in your CRM, I probably wouldn't answer the phone,
[00:10:24] not because I don't like you, but because it's my birthday and I probably don't want to answer
[00:10:27] the phone.
[00:10:28] But maybe the next day or later on that day when I go back to listen, I would, I would very much go,
[00:10:34] that was sweet of her, that was nice.
[00:10:35] So for those that are like, ooh, I'm a little nervous talking, most people aren't going to pick up,
[00:10:40] but you can still leave them a nice thoughtful message.
[00:10:43] What I realized too, DJ, is when I do get people, I find out things that otherwise,
[00:10:52] I would never have found out.
[00:10:54] You know, somebody's been sick in their family or they've just gotten some kind of news.
[00:10:59] It's amazing and that's one call maybe out of 20, but if I hadn't made the call, I would never
[00:11:06] know. So I'm always like, oh, I'm so glad I made that call today.
[00:11:11] Well, it's true too because a lot of times, we think, well, how else do we get our news about people
[00:11:16] in our lives while we might look on social media? And when things are maybe not going well for
[00:11:22] a family or they're going through some sort of difficult time, maybe they're not posting about
[00:11:27] that on Facebook. Some people do, a lot of people don't. And so you might not know unless you
[00:11:32] picked up the phone and reached out. So let's talk about how you did get started pre-internet,
[00:11:38] right? Like you still had to go out and prospect and obviously, you know, we're talking about
[00:11:43] a long time ago, but I think, you know, a lot of the ways in which you probably prospected or built
[00:11:49] your business then still are applicable today, because I think fundamentals typically don't change.
[00:11:54] So I'm just curious, you know, back in the early 90s when you were starting this new career,
[00:11:59] how did you grow your business where you didn't have a background of being in real estate?
[00:12:05] Well, one of the first things I did when I got into the business, even before I got in,
[00:12:10] I had an IBM discount to buy a laptop and I bought a laptop and I loaded everybody that I knew
[00:12:17] into a database. So just, you know, that's the bare fundamentals and that has not changed today.
[00:12:24] If people, that's how you get started as you build a database. So I did that. You know, we had
[00:12:31] computers that would access. So when I started, I called expired listings for sale by owners.
[00:12:39] Those were out on a computer. You had to go to the office to get it, you know, to key it in and
[00:12:46] you could see the listings that are coming up, but you had to go into the office to do it. So that
[00:12:50] that is very different. But a lot of it was the same, same old, same old, I'm getting on the phone
[00:12:57] and call those expires. I eventually got to the point where I decided that really wasn't what I
[00:13:03] wanted to, where I wanted to live and that expired FSBO world. So I ended up doing
[00:13:09] much more of a referral based business once I got a little traction going. So yeah, I, I, but I think
[00:13:17] even though you're like, oh, the expires and for sale by owners aren't for me. And I think most
[00:13:23] agents probably have a similar experience with for sale by owners. You have to be a special kind of
[00:13:29] personality, I think, to be able to withstand some of the difficulties of calling expires and
[00:13:35] and for sale by owners, they are tough calls or they can be tough, of course. But certainly the
[00:13:41] kinder, or nice to say kinder, I'm sorry, the gentler approach is the working by referral made,
[00:13:47] you know, famous, well, made famous by a lot of people. But in the real estate industry, Brian
[00:13:52] Baphini is sort of associated with working by referral, lived the easy life, his one of his
[00:13:59] slogans. I know you're a fan of Baphini systems, I am as well. And you, you've not just worked with
[00:14:04] Baphini and his company, but other other systems too. But how important was it? Because I know you
[00:14:09] really dove into this. Probably I'm guessing getting the training at IBM where training is so important
[00:14:17] and there's such a white glove firm that you probably sort of thought, I got to get my knowledge up.
[00:14:23] And so talk about going to conferences and the importance of that for you in those early days.
[00:14:29] In the company that I was with had good basic training in terms of, you know, when you're getting
[00:14:35] started and what's the contract and what do you need to know. But for anything more advanced,
[00:14:41] I found I had to travel somewhere and learn. And that stood in my personality so well. I'm very
[00:14:49] learning based. I love learning new things. I think if I didn't, if I stopped learning in this
[00:14:54] business, I would not want to do it anymore. But even after all these years, I feel like I learned
[00:14:58] something new every day. But I would go to conferences. I went to, there was a guy named Howard
[00:15:04] Britton that assembled all these top agents from all over the country. And I went to that. I went to
[00:15:10] Baphini. I went to some other trainers as well. Just learning and trying to figure out what fit me
[00:15:18] and what felt right. And then my style now is a mixture of a lot of different trainers that I've
[00:15:26] heard over the years. My core is Baphini that just working by referral. That's the core. And I
[00:15:35] still love that system. And you know, you can add on top of that, add the videos, add, add all
[00:15:41] the fun things. But at the core, it really needs to be, in my opinion, it needs to be about
[00:15:48] relationship and digging deeper and going deeper with people serving them at its deeper level as we can.
[00:15:56] Could not agree with you more. I apologize our internet. It may be a little choppy. So if anyone's,
[00:16:02] if I'm choppy, anyone I apologize. But I absolutely agree with you, Kathy. You know, I was thinking about
[00:16:08] the Brian Baphini when what I liked about what I liked about Brian Baphini is he came up the idea
[00:16:17] basically and there's a lot of different principles of his teachings. But I've always loved the idea
[00:16:22] of sending an item, he calls them items of value, right? And he says basically, you know, you really
[00:16:29] should be giving your prospects to clients something of value every single month or whatever the
[00:16:35] the time commitment is or the duration is. But it's really important because you really always
[00:16:41] want to be sort of giving people things where they're like that was thoughtful, that was helpful,
[00:16:45] that that really is something information or something I can use. And he was a little bit ahead of
[00:16:52] the curve on that because now we know that like social media is all about providing content. You
[00:16:57] know, it's all about, sorry, all about providing value through content. And like, you know, if we
[00:17:02] expect people to watch our videos on Facebook or TikTok or wherever they may be, they better be pretty,
[00:17:06] at least nothing else entertaining, but better than that, hopefully providing some actual
[00:17:11] information that people can use. And Baphini was one of the first people I saw a sales trainer
[00:17:18] that was like, this is the way to people's hearts. Obviously, there's more to it than just that.
[00:17:23] But I have always been a huge fan of that. Curious to get your thoughts on the items of value.
[00:17:29] Yeah, I mean, I think now most of us have transitioned into more of an email and or as you
[00:17:37] pointed out, social media, video messages. He still provides monthly, the mailers, things you
[00:17:52] never know what works for certain people. So, well, you have built a referral based business and
[00:18:01] everyone, now I shouldn't say everyone, I would say most agents I have spoken to during my career
[00:18:07] in this industry about 13 or 14 years, almost everyone I meet says they want a referral based
[00:18:12] business. So that is obviously a common goal for a lot of agents. How long did it take you to do
[00:18:19] that? And what were some of the ways in which you began to transition away from making the cold calls
[00:18:25] to how do I get other people to market for me? Again, I think it goes back to building relationships.
[00:18:34] When someone knows and trusts another person, they are, if they have an opportunity, they will,
[00:18:41] you'll be the one that they recommend to their friends. So I think it's nothing magic about it.
[00:18:50] It's just getting in front of people. To this day, we still do a lot of lunches. I have lunch with
[00:18:57] someone almost every day of the week, coffees, just being in relationship with people.
[00:19:05] Let me drill down on that. I apologize, Kathy. This is really great because having lunch every day with
[00:19:10] somebody is something that all the hundreds of episodes I've done. I think you may be the first to
[00:19:16] talk about that specific sort of strategy. And can you talk a little bit about who you choose to
[00:19:23] take the lunch, what you talk about? Because this would be super helpful to our audience. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:19:28] So I would say those falls into two camps. Number one is past clients or prospect, somebody
[00:19:35] that I'm working with or have worked with. So that is one whole group. That's a pretty easy
[00:19:43] group because what do you talk about? You talk about their life, their families, the old
[00:19:48] forward family occupation, recreation, and dreams. It's all about getting to know them better.
[00:19:55] That's one bucket. The other bucket is trusted advisors. This has been a focus of mine over the
[00:20:02] last few years to try to get to know more estate attorneys, more wealth advisors, CPAs,
[00:20:12] divorce attorneys. So those people have the opportunity to refer multiple people.
[00:20:19] So to the extent that I can build a relationship there, the opportunity is just much greater
[00:20:28] than an individual who might have a friend who needs to buy or sell real estate. So I really do a lot
[00:20:34] of both. The trusted advisor is a really fun thing to do once you kind of get your feet wet with it.
[00:20:44] And they get my sane marketing that I'm sending to everybody else. At first I was like, okay,
[00:20:51] I've got to send something real. Just for them. Just for them. That's real, you know,
[00:20:56] that's real professional or real business, not fun. But they like fun things too. So I kind of
[00:21:05] had to get over the axe. It's just too much work to do two different things. When I'm meet with them,
[00:21:10] I may bring something more professional, some statistics or questions for them on their business,
[00:21:18] but the basic marketing is the same. So that's been fun. I'm not actually getting ready to start
[00:21:25] something I'm really excited about. I'm starting a group of women who are what I would call
[00:21:33] trusted advisors. And I'm hoping, we're having our first meeting coming up, but I'm hoping to
[00:21:38] meet once a quarter with this group and really build strong bonds. There's a financial advisor.
[00:21:46] There's a high-end insurance broker, a state attorney CPA. So I think it has a lot of
[00:21:55] potential and recommend anybody could do that, whether it's women or men or both.
[00:22:01] Those are all amazing professions to consider, to add to your professional, you know,
[00:22:07] service or professional network, I should say, because you're absolutely right. Those are people
[00:22:13] that are oftentimes dealing with life events, which typically may result in a transition of home,
[00:22:19] people moving in, people moving out, selling, buying, divorce attorneys are the most obvious
[00:22:23] example of that. But you know, you're right, a state planning attorney, as you mentioned.
[00:22:29] Some of my best business in the last year has been from a state attorneys.
[00:22:33] So such a smart idea. And oftentimes, a overlooked specialty for REALTORS. We think divorce, divorce,
[00:22:41] divorce, yes, and a state planning attorneys as well, because of course, those are,
[00:22:48] and you know, you could also too, I think possibly, there's just a weird idea that maybe
[00:22:53] isn't a good one. But people who work in mergers and acquisitions as well may, if it's,
[00:22:59] they work locally, they may be having companies that are moving in, moving out. So there's maybe
[00:23:04] some opportunities there as well. But I agree that having that professional network is awesome,
[00:23:10] because you can basically share clients and refer and say, I've got a great estate planning
[00:23:14] attorney. And by the way, everybody needs a great estate planning attorney. It's a really
[00:23:18] important thing, you know, and when somebody's going through a family change, having a good divorce
[00:23:24] attorney, obviously, is important as well and a good accountant and all of these things. So,
[00:23:29] Kathy is so, this is such a great point. I'm sort of sticking on it for a moment because I really
[00:23:34] want to sink in. Kathy, thank you for that. I really, everyone out there, yes, have lunch with
[00:23:40] your clients and your prospects. And yes, yes, yes, always do that. And let's add in some
[00:23:44] professional people where you can actually help their business. And I think the best way to have
[00:23:49] those conversations is say, hey, I would like to learn more about your business. Mr.
[00:23:53] or Mrs. estate planning attorney, what can I do? I have clients. Here's what my clients are like.
[00:23:58] Here's what they do. Would they be of benefit to you? What can I provide to you first? And then
[00:24:05] hopefully it becomes a reciprocal scenario. Exactly. Yep. Yep. What else did you do, too? So,
[00:24:12] we talked about sort of this networking staying in touch with your sphere, taking them out,
[00:24:17] seeing them face to face, also doing the same creating this networking group that you have and also
[00:24:22] just these trusted advisors. What I want to ask, because we talk about this a lot, and I know this
[00:24:28] isn't a, probably a really easy answer for this. So, I'm going to give you a little bit of a tougher
[00:24:32] question only just to see what you might answer, because we talk about, in real estate, we hear this
[00:24:39] phrase a lot, people who know, like, and trust us are the ones most likely to work with us. This
[00:24:44] is working by referral. No, like, and trust. We hear that over and over again. But I also think
[00:24:49] that I believe that trust is earned. So, I'm curious on, yes, you have to earn the no, like,
[00:24:58] and trust part. How are you, because you obviously do earn it, and you have earned it. What do you do
[00:25:03] during, when you're working with a client that would eventually get them to say, not just, you know,
[00:25:09] hey, I had a good transaction, a closed, et cetera, but I really, really like Kathy. I really felt
[00:25:14] she did a good job for me. I imagine you have certain standards in your business that lead to the
[00:25:20] no, like, and trust. I'm guessing. Yes, I know that we do, and we're always working on trying to
[00:25:28] improve that. I mean, it's boiled. To me, a lot of it just is so basic. It's communication.
[00:25:36] Yeah, pick up the phone when it rings. Yeah, it's being in touch. It's making sure that the client's
[00:25:43] needs are answered. And my husband and I work together. He works with buyers, and I work with
[00:25:49] sellers, and I do most of the lead generation. He is incredible about being patient, and spending,
[00:25:58] I hear him spending hours and hours on the phone with people explaining things in the inspection,
[00:26:05] or explaining, you know, the appraisal issues, or, you know, whatever it is, it's that taking the
[00:26:12] time with them. And he's, honestly, he's much more patient than I am. So he's in a good role,
[00:26:19] but I think that that's what people need. And it's not necessarily the first time buyers,
[00:26:29] some of the high end buyers need just as much as anybody else. So I think that that's part of it,
[00:26:37] just taking time and building, building that trust, and doing what you say you're going to do.
[00:26:43] I have a great assistant who is there. And does she ever drop the ball? Do I ever drop the ball?
[00:26:51] Of course, occasionally, but for the most part, we do what we say we're going to do. And then
[00:26:55] we love to stay in touch with people afterwards too. And I think that's really a lot of times where
[00:27:03] you build referrals is, you know, it's not just one and done. And, you know, you're on to the
[00:27:08] next. You're calling them and checking on them and making sure we love to stay in touch with people
[00:27:15] on an ongoing basis. I always say, you know, what should get in our web? You can't get out.
[00:27:19] Until you say stop. Exactly. And nobody probably ever does that because.
[00:27:27] No one ever has. Yeah, of course. Of course. And you know, it's really important too. You said
[00:27:32] something very profound now, which again, it's it's back to a fundamental of in between the sales.
[00:27:37] How what are we doing in between sales to stay in touch with that client? Because they're probably not
[00:27:42] moving for another, I don't know, seven years, five, seven years, whatever the source.
[00:27:46] Or more. And but we want to make sure that when they are ready and we won't know when that is
[00:27:51] necessarily, we want to make sure we're top of mind. And so this idea of reaching out in between
[00:27:58] is really, it's I think it's a lot simpler than people make it because it could be as easy as
[00:28:04] somebody bought a home from you. Call them a month in. Hey, how did the move and go? How is everything
[00:28:08] new? Good? Any problems? Just want to be call me if you have any. If you need anything, I've got
[00:28:13] a network of people I can connect you to. It really, that could be almost the call every year. If
[00:28:18] nothing else you want to talk about is how's the home? How's everything going? What's going on with
[00:28:23] family? Everything good? It just it can just be a check-in really. Yeah, really. Yep. I used to,
[00:28:29] I remember I this is a I'll make this story very short and I will tell you this sounds really silly
[00:28:34] but it made me feel very special. When I was in high school, I had a friend who had an older brother
[00:28:38] who went to MIT for college. He was like the genius of all of our friends. He was, yeah, anyway.
[00:28:45] So he went to MIT and he says, Oh, I'm taking a class by Dr. Amar or a mere Bose, the guy who created
[00:28:52] Bose sound. So Bose speakers. And he said, if you want to buy any Bose speakers, we get a discount.
[00:28:59] So anyway, because he was in the class. So I bought some speakers through my friend and whatever,
[00:29:04] cheap speakers, I mean, great speakers, but inexpensive. It wasn't like a big purchase, a couple
[00:29:07] hundred bucks, whatever. And every year after that for five years, Bose would call me once a year
[00:29:14] and say, just checking in, how are the speakers performing? And I was like, it blew my mind and
[00:29:20] stopped doing it. Amazing. Right now, I'm sure probably because it was purchased through his class.
[00:29:25] Maybe I got put a special category of like, make sure to take care of these people, but it sounds
[00:29:30] silly, but it really made me feel important. I don't, I have never met another company that does
[00:29:35] that. And that was 1993, maybe. So so anyway, this is a point back to calling. Yeah.
[00:29:45] Playing about the house, all you had to do is call and say, how's everything going? What's going on?
[00:29:49] Simple. Simple. But but you said, I'm so okay. So in between sales, we want to stay in touch.
[00:29:57] When you're working with a client, when you're in a transaction, let's say nothing's happening,
[00:30:02] you get no activity on a listing. Let's just say as an example, no new interest. Let's say a week
[00:30:08] goes by, what are you doing? Or are you doing anything to talk to the seller to say, okay,
[00:30:14] here's what's happening or what is your philosophy around that? DJ, that is the worst.
[00:30:20] The worst time when nothing's happening. And you know, Atlanta, the market has been so good that
[00:30:27] we haven't, we're still not experiencing that, but I believe me, I've been through that. I'm
[00:30:32] I'm sure live through, I live through the recession. So, you know, I think that in normal times,
[00:30:42] before too many days go by, you're getting a message from the market. The market, oh, we say
[00:30:48] the market will talk back. If we're not getting showings, if we're not getting offers, interest,
[00:30:54] then the market is telling us something. So, I think just planning the seed, obvious,
[00:31:01] I'm maybe this is an obvious, but it goes without saying that, okay, here's what I have been doing.
[00:31:06] You know, here's where your listing has been, how many hits you've had on the website, et cetera.
[00:31:13] So, a report to them, but then I think even after a week, we start planning the seeds for
[00:31:22] pricing, a pricing adjustment. Unless it's just like the recession or something like that,
[00:31:27] I think that normally, if a house isn't getting any activity, that's that's the message we need to
[00:31:34] be getting to the client. Does that make sense? Yeah, it does. It makes perfect sense. And
[00:31:40] are, I know that there can be some call reluctance or reluctance to pick up the phone when nothing is
[00:31:48] happening. Even, you know, a few days maybe where nothing's happening, what are you doing to keep
[00:31:54] the buyer or seller informed, even when there's not much to report, because I know a lot of agents
[00:32:03] don't maybe aren't as proactive when things aren't happening. I once had asked a top producer
[00:32:08] here in Chicago, so silly, but I said, why do you think she's number two in all of Chicago?
[00:32:15] And I said, why do you think out of 40,000 agents here number two? And she goes, I call my clients
[00:32:20] every week and tell them what's going on. And I said, well, and she goes, that's kind of it.
[00:32:25] And she goes, DJ, you'd be surprised. Very few agents do that. Yeah, really.
[00:32:30] And I would not claim to be perfect at that by any means. But again, just picking up the phone
[00:32:37] and touching base. And even when things are happening, I think that people just want to hear
[00:32:44] from you. I listed a new house yesterday and we've got some showings lined up. And I plan to just
[00:32:52] touch bases with them and say, you know, they're out of town actually, so they don't know precisely
[00:32:57] what's going on. But just to say, you know, we've had these showings. This first one said they
[00:33:02] weren't interested, but we know we've got some more lined up for the weekend. Just that communication.
[00:33:08] And honestly, I'm not always the best at it, but it's a goal to be more in communication.
[00:33:15] And I think people appreciate it. They never mind. When you've got their house on the market
[00:33:20] or a house for them under contract, I don't think you can call them too often. I don't think
[00:33:26] you can over, overdo it. Or they'll let you know if you're overdoing it.
[00:33:31] Yeah. And odds are, they're probably not going to say, stop communicating with me about this
[00:33:36] transaction. Right. And so that brings up a point that, you know, the best thing to start off with
[00:33:43] is to ask how you want to be communicated with. Do you want to have a phone call? Do you want me
[00:33:48] to text you? Do you want me to email you? So then the person who says, I want you to call me,
[00:33:54] they're not going to mind if you're calling. So we need to, we need to continue to do that.
[00:34:01] We kind of come and sometimes we kind of forget on that. But you know what I love about top producers?
[00:34:06] Is they say these really profound things, but to them it's like, like,
[00:34:09] I'm going to get a phone call.
[00:34:19] That question said something incredibly important, which was ask your clients,
[00:34:25] how do you prefer to be communicated? Would you like a phone call? Would you rather have a text?
[00:34:30] You know, is it okay if I leave a voice mail? Do you know what, what are the hours you want me
[00:34:35] to call you? When do you not want me to bother you? These
[00:34:44] these are the ones that just this is what she knows, but a lot of agents don't know this. So
[00:34:53] remember, the problem, so there's the golden rule, which is true. You want to be treated.
[00:34:56] The platinum rule is like,
[00:35:02] other people, they want to be treated. That's you have to ask questions to get that. So Kathy,
[00:35:06] again, seems like a small thing you said, maybe to you, but really, really profound. Don't just
[00:35:11] assume everyone communicates in the same manner because they don't. What are we doing to celebrate?
[00:35:21] Or what are you in your, oh, I'm sorry, I wanted to mention this other thing. You said that was
[00:35:25] really, really important because Kathy is very self-aware. She said at the beginning,
[00:35:32] you know, there's certain things I'm not as strong at, which is why her husband fills in those
[00:35:38] challenges. So she talked to Kathy, had mentioned she maybe isn't the most patient person,
[00:35:44] and that's not a negative. That's just part of your personality. You're good at some things,
[00:35:48] and other things you're weaker at. And maybe patients isn't always something that you can just
[00:35:54] learn to be more patient. So what Kathy said is instead of just while I'm going to fight against this,
[00:35:58] and do it, I'm going to get somebody who's really, really good at that because it is important that I
[00:36:02] have somebody that's super patient, and she has her husband step in. So what is the lesson from this?
[00:36:07] Well, we know that teams are on the rise, and look, the truth is you just can't do everything.
[00:36:12] You just can't. You're not going to be good at everything. So I love the fact that you have a,
[00:36:17] I mean, your husband, great, good thing that his skill set is different than yours, because you
[00:36:22] guys can then compliment each other and you go, oh, you know, this person's going to need some
[00:36:26] patients, you know, husband, you take care of this one, and it works really well. And then that
[00:36:31] client gets everything they want. Right. And we intentionally, when he, he joined me in the business
[00:36:38] a few years ago, and I never wanted there to be a situation where we would be like, oh, you said
[00:36:45] you were going to call him, no, you said you were going to call him and nobody's called him.
[00:36:48] So we have a very, very clear definition, Bob works with buyers. I work with the sellers.
[00:36:56] And occasionally we still are talking about our clients. And we know what's going on. And
[00:37:03] occasionally we'll, we'll be involved in in the other side, but for the most part, it's very well
[00:37:10] delineated. And that has worked very well for us. And that's that's fantastic. I'm fortunate that
[00:37:16] he loves doing the buyer. It's not everybody does. Well, and typically people who who are working
[00:37:22] agents that are working with buyers typically do need more patients because those transactions
[00:37:27] tend to take longer. And obviously there's a lot more that can go wrong on the buy side.
[00:37:33] Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. And it is, it is great though that you do have somebody, your husband,
[00:37:39] of course, in this case, that's able to, to step in and, and help out in, in that way, and make,
[00:37:45] make it so that you don't say, well, I'm not really a buyer's agent. No, my husband, he's,
[00:37:50] he's the buyer's agent and he'll take awesome care of you. What, what are you, do you do any
[00:37:56] client appreciation events? I'm curious if you've started doing that or if you're working on that,
[00:38:01] or if those are going in your business. We love parties. My husband says that we are a
[00:38:10] and event company posing as a real estate company. You know, it's funny. I asked that question
[00:38:17] and I was like, I hope she's doing client appreciation. Well, she's going to be like, yeah, we,
[00:38:19] we don't do that. And because I had no knowledge, I'm like, she has to do this. And so I'm so glad.
[00:38:24] We love it. Oh, we love it. We love it. And we do all kinds of things. We, we love having
[00:38:32] dinner parties. We love having six people around the table and just breaking bread. That's really
[00:38:37] where you get to know people and and we like mixing people up that don't know each other. And
[00:38:42] sometimes we'll have people that know each other. So we do all kinds of things. We'll do some
[00:38:47] medium-sized parties where maybe we'll have 20 people over for drinks or something. And then
[00:38:53] a few times a year, we have a big event. We're planning right now a big pizza party. We have a
[00:39:02] person that a company that comes with this big wood wood fired grill and they grill the pizzas.
[00:39:10] They're delicious. We'll have wine and beer. This year I've got a gelato company coming to serve
[00:39:17] gelato. And we have a DJ and it's all in our driveway. So it's we're praying for good weather.
[00:39:23] But it's it's lots of fun. We've done a few, we've done it several times before and it's always
[00:39:29] a fun party. So that's one of our biggest parties. We will probably have 200 people here
[00:39:36] altogether and my husband doesn't know that yet. So I don't tell him.
[00:39:41] But you know we do pies. We do a pie party at Thanksgiving and we've done movie parties. We've
[00:39:47] done a little bit of everything. We love to travel and when we get back from a trip say to
[00:39:53] France, for example, we will last year we had a French wine and cheese party. So you know some
[00:39:59] things like that. Well, that's a great idea. So you go on a trip and I wasn't sure where you were
[00:40:04] going with that. So that's amazing. You go on a trip, you know, you experience the culture of
[00:40:08] another country and then you bring that culture back with you. So that is I have never heard of
[00:40:13] anyone doing that. That is a very fun. It's very fun. Yeah. Oh my gosh, brilliant. What a great
[00:40:20] thing. What a great I always love these. It's always I've been doing this for five or six years.
[00:40:25] Anytime I hear something new and I know it's not new. It's not like you're the first person to
[00:40:29] ever do that. I just have never heard of it. And so it's new to me and I love it. So that's
[00:40:34] you see it's it's a lot about activity, right? It's it's just like you were saying I make 10 phone
[00:40:40] calls every day. I bet most REALTORS don't even do that. And I'm not here to criticize everyone.
[00:40:44] I'm just here to challenge people to realize this is what tout producers do. They pick up the
[00:40:50] phone or some version of that. Are you are you doing a lot on social media or is that something that
[00:40:57] you know you're not as connected to? So almost two years ago I hired a marketing
[00:41:06] gal who was helping me and she is guiding me. She does she actually does most of the posts.
[00:41:15] I'll do I'll do some myself just personal ones but she's doing the business ones.
[00:41:20] And I originally came to you through Kim Rittberg and Kim is helping me with video trying to get me
[00:41:31] we're going to work on messaging this fall and really trying to create messages that resonate
[00:41:36] and that going back to your original point of value. It's not just about nothing. It's about
[00:41:43] something that hopefully will no message is going to appeal to everyone all the time. But
[00:41:49] if we can just make it something that's that's interesting and informative to a number of people.
[00:41:56] I think I'm real excited about that to try to kind of take it to the next level.
[00:42:01] I also think too and by the way I plug for Kim Rittberg. She has a her own series on our podcast.
[00:42:09] We love Kim. She's our social media expert. And I didn't realize that you were you came through
[00:42:15] by way of her. So I am so excited because Kim is one of my favorite people. I think I've just about
[00:42:20] ever met. So I am I just absolutely adore her and I encourage everyone to listen to her series
[00:42:27] on our show. Just look for for Kim's Kim's episodes. She is a real gem.
[00:42:34] And yeah, you're talking about value. I think because I know there's this a lot of us in this
[00:42:41] industry have a perfectionist mindset. We want our headshots to look perfect or we want our by
[00:42:46] the way. I'm going to divert from what I was saying. I was just at a Zillow conference the last two
[00:42:52] days I showing time, which is owned by basically by Zillow. I was at a conference for them. I was
[00:42:58] fortunate enough to get to go. And they said they showed a statistic that is so interesting.
[00:43:03] Speaking of headshots and it just came to me, I totally forgot. This is amazing. And I wish I
[00:43:07] could show people this although it's a podcast. So when most people wouldn't be able to see it anyway.
[00:43:13] But they showed some data that suggests that headshots are done. Nobody wants to see headshots
[00:43:20] anymore. What they want to see is a still a professional photo. But what they actually want to see is
[00:43:25] you being captured doing something that you enjoy, something that is a passion for you, whether
[00:43:33] it's real estate, maybe you play guitar, maybe you're into whatever. Maybe you just want, you know,
[00:43:37] you're a great mom or whatever you're into. They actually people, they had data to support this.
[00:43:43] They said, nobody wants to see the perfect airbrushed photo anymore. They want to see you in action,
[00:43:48] which makes sense because we follow people on social media and we see them doing what they do.
[00:43:53] So for anyone out there who's thinking about getting a new headshot, yes, get a new headshot,
[00:43:57] obviously get that and get some shots of you doing other things and people actually find that
[00:44:04] to be more inviting and more real and more authentic. So just a little plug from something I learned
[00:44:09] from from Zillow last couple days. But Kathy, sorry to interrupt you. That's really interesting.
[00:44:16] Really interesting. Yeah. Oh, here's another one real quick. Sorry, just because it's coming to me.
[00:44:22] Use white linens. If you can on your listing presentations for the master bedroom, sorry,
[00:44:29] for the primary bedroom, use white linens if possible because Zillow has found that by using a white,
[00:44:36] like a duvet or white, you know, comforter, 30% more clicks versus a colored, different color
[00:44:44] than white. I mean, crazy, weird things. So if I was an agent, I might just buy like a king size
[00:44:49] comfort and keep it in my trunk. So anyway, okay, back to Kathy. I'm so sorry. I just, I got
[00:44:57] no ideas. You're going to be good ideas. Well, I need to learn from you because you're really so much
[00:45:03] further along the path. And I'm Kathy, what? Let's talk about boundaries in the sense of, you know,
[00:45:10] we know that mothers parents know this as well as REALTORS know this. If we don't set some sort
[00:45:17] of boundaries for our, you know, for our people in our lives, especially if we have children,
[00:45:23] they may challenge those boundaries. Clients can do the same thing. How do you handle a 10 o'clock
[00:45:30] and that? Not everyone. Do you set certain expectations for your clients so that they know
[00:45:38] what to expect if they reach out at like an odd hour? I wouldn't say that I typically say, okay,
[00:45:48] you can call me between eight and six. I don't have that. I know some agents have that on their
[00:45:54] voice mail and all that. But honestly, I usually got a bet around 10 and I'm not answering the phone
[00:46:02] after that. But I do think that it's for me and my husband, it's more event or situation driven.
[00:46:15] I answered the phone last night because I just got a contract worked out at eight o'clock and
[00:46:20] the guy had a question. So I answered the phone at quarter of 10 and my know my husband has been
[00:46:26] up to midnight with people going, you know, when there's a deadline on an inspection or something
[00:46:31] like that. So I wouldn't say we have any hard and fast. Okay, these are our business hours. I
[00:46:37] don't think there's anything wrong with doing that. We're at a point in life when we don't have
[00:46:42] any kids at home. So it really takes the pressure off of that. And we are working on no phones at
[00:46:51] the dinner. You know, that kind of thing. That's sort of basic. But if a message comes in late at night
[00:46:59] that you don't want to handle, you've been a REALTOR for a very long time. Can we tell the rest of
[00:47:08] our audience that in most cases, it can wait. It can wait till the morning. Oh yeah, there's nothing
[00:47:13] wrong with voice mail. You can get it tomorrow. That's absolutely right. And the problem with text
[00:47:18] messages is there's no end to a text message conversation. Right. Phone calls have a start and
[00:47:24] yeah, text messages have a start. They don't have an end. Yeah, that's a very good point. I never
[00:47:29] thought about that. But yeah, if you start it, unless you say, I'm sorry, go to bed now.
[00:47:34] Night night. Yes. Which by the way, is an absolutely reasonable thing if the person is expecting
[00:47:41] some sort of response. You could just say, oh, I'm headed to bed first thing in the morning,
[00:47:45] I got it or whatever. Yeah. Who can, who can, you know, argue with that? Kathy, we should also
[00:47:50] mention too that, you know, our show is a show four agents by agents, listen to by agents as well.
[00:47:59] So, you know, we also want to promote referrals and we know that Kathy works in downtown Atlanta.
[00:48:05] She is and the nearby surrounding suburbs as well. But Atlanta is a hotbed for people moving in
[00:48:11] and out. Lots of big companies are there. And if anyone does have people moving into Atlanta,
[00:48:18] in particular, the metro area and the close suburbs, you know, Kathy is a great resource.
[00:48:24] So, Kathy, if there are agents out there that either maybe want to connect with you because you
[00:48:28] might have people that are moving from Atlanta, like down in Florida or wherever they may be retiring to.
[00:48:34] Absolutely. Yeah. So, what's the best way if somebody wants to connect with you that they can reach out?
[00:48:39] My website is just simplelemontime.com, l-a-m-o-n-t-m-o-n-team.com. I'm Kathy at LeMontime.com. I'm on Facebook
[00:48:53] Insta, all those good places. And I think you said you were going to put it in the show notes too.
[00:48:58] I will. Absolutely. But we, I really, you know, Kathy, it's funny. I was just sort of reflecting on
[00:49:05] what we've talked about today. And there are lots of great tips here that Kathy provided. So,
[00:49:11] on behalf of our audience, I mean, really, this was a chock full episode of actionable strategies
[00:49:17] by somebody who's been in real estate for over 30 years now. Congratulations, by the way. Did you
[00:49:23] do the math right on that? Yes. Yeah. That is impressive. And not, and Kathy has seen, oh, by the way,
[00:49:30] Kathy, you've been through some ups and downs last question. Are, are we worried right now about
[00:49:35] the market at all? Are we worried about interest rates? Are, are we like, we've seen this before?
[00:49:40] It's going to be fine. We are going to be fine. And as you pointed out on the big follow-up,
[00:49:46] Brian Bafini, he is very optimistic about what's going to happen with the rates and the market.
[00:49:52] His message right now is to focus on listings. We need to be listing, listing, listing, and
[00:49:59] learning. You know, if you don't have listings, go to a class and learn how to do them better. So
[00:50:04] just investing yourself, invest in your people. And really, he says we're going to have a great
[00:50:12] 2024. So, good things ahead. And for anyone out there who's like, how do I get more listings?
[00:50:18] There's a million ways to do it. But one one way that I think would be particularly applicable
[00:50:22] today is and Kathy can tell me if I'm nuts and wrong because I might be. But, um, well, I'm definitely
[00:50:30] nuts, but I'm also, I may be wrong. That's for sure. I'm definitely crazy. But, um, you know,
[00:50:36] people are always interested to know what their home value is, right? This is why Zillow became Zillow.
[00:50:43] It was the Zestimate. It wasn't the home search. It was actually the Zestimate. And the Zestimate
[00:50:48] then gave birth really to their home search. So, you know, people, whether, whatever we think of
[00:50:54] the Zestimate, people like to see the Zestimate, whatever, however accurate we think it is or not,
[00:51:00] this is a great opportunity to take a lesson from Zillow's playbook and maybe reach out to people
[00:51:05] who, whether they were your client or not, hey, I thought I would show you what I believe your home
[00:51:09] is approximately worth right now. Would you be interested in seeing that? I mean, I would always
[00:51:14] be interested in seeing that. So, I don't know if you do CMAs for your clients, I'm sure you
[00:51:19] would. I did one yesterday as a matter of fact, yes. Mm-hmm. And, and by the way, as much as I love,
[00:51:25] I think Zillow's a great company and I, I like Zillow a lot of agents do not. I understand and
[00:51:29] respect that as well. But, if I'm looking for an actual CMA, I don't, I don't use Zest, I use
[00:51:36] Zestimate as like a starting point. Like, okay, that's what Zillow thinks. But, I want somebody like
[00:51:40] Kathy showing me exactly what she thinks after 30 years of business because she knows the market
[00:51:44] better than, you know, an algorithm likely could. So, this is a great opportunity, guys, to exercise
[00:51:50] your, your experience and, and, you know, show people, hey, this is what I think right now,
[00:51:56] um, great opportunity there. But, on behalf of our audience for all the great tips and advice
[00:51:59] that Kathy provided, we say thank you to Kathy and her, her, her team, her husband's not on the call.
[00:52:06] But, we, we say thank you to him as well, um, for some of the tips that you mentioned that he has.
[00:52:12] And, on behalf of Kathy and myself, we'd be remiss if we didn't say thanks to the audience.
[00:52:16] Thanks for listening. Thanks for making me, thank you. And thanks for making it to the end of the
[00:52:21] episode. We just asked everybody to do two quick things for us. I know it's a lot to ask, but just tell,
[00:52:25] one thing, tell a friend, think of one other REALTOR that could benefit. This is a great episode.
[00:52:30] Send it to people that are struggling right now, agents that are like, what do I do? It's
[00:52:35] yes, send this to them. They'll get some great ideas. And also, please leave us a review. Whatever
[00:52:39] you're listening to the spot, guys, let us know what you think of the show. Um, constructive
[00:52:43] criticism is always important to us. We, we write that we do this episodes. We do the show for you.
[00:52:48] So please let us know how we can improve it and also what you like as well. Kathy, thank you so
[00:52:53] much. We are so honored to have you. You're a big deal. And you didn't have time to do this.
[00:52:58] You found time. So thank you. Well, thank you. Visit Lamon team.com LAMON team.com links to all of
[00:53:08] Kathy's websites and email and social media in the show notes. Reach out. She's a lovely

[00:53:21] one thing they have that new agents just don't they don't have wisdom yet. You don't have it. That's
[00:53:25] something that comes with time and people like Kathy, I don't want to make you sound like you're
[00:53:30] older. Kathy, that is not what I'm saying. I don't think you're older, but just being in the business

Happy 6th birthday to all of us and birthday, I guess anniversary, whatever. Happy 6th to all of us listening. And let's get to the main event, my conversation with Kathy Le Mans. Today on the show, we have Kathy Le Mans with Keller Williams in Atlanta. Let me tell you more about Kathy. Now Kathy Le Mans began selling a real estate in 1992 after leaving the corporate world of IBM sales where they were offering incentives to downsize their workforce. Kathy took advantage of that and joined a locally owned brokerage with about 500 agents and set to learn all that she could by attending trainings and conferences all over the country. Now, 2001, she was given the opportunity to invest in a new Keller Williams office in Buckhead where she has been ever since. And she has a small team consisting of herself, her husband, and a full-time licensed operations manager. And their goal this year is to help 42 families build a life they love. And her average price point is about $750,000. And she works, her and her team work predominantly by referral. I want everybody to visit Kathy's website because not only is she our guest and we should always support our guests. But she's a really beautiful looking website. Lamontime.com L-A-M-O-N team.com. You can also find links to all of her social channels there. We will post links to that in our show notes as well. But Lamontime.com is where you go to learn about Kathy and her team. Kathy, welcome to the show. Thank you, DJ. I'm glad to be here. Thanks for your glad you're here as well. It's funny when you were thinking about your bio. And I actually was in Buckhead in 2001 with Anheuser Bush. I was, they were having their conference in Atlanta and they had rented out a good, a number of the Buckhead bars for this conference. The conference was at the CNN Center or I don't know what it's technically called, but over there, downtown. And then in Buckhead was, they had all these fun nighttime activities. And then I went back and visited Buckhead, mentally, I don't know, five or six years later. And it had really blossomed. And even now it's obviously blossomed even further. But what a fun area to have in office. You picked a great location in the Atlanta Metro. It is a great location. Fun things to do, a lot of good restaurants, great people, and never a dull moment in Buckhead. Lots of fun to be had and it is really a fun place to visit. So if you haven't, if you haven't ever been to Atlanta, go to the world of Coke and go visit Buckhead. I think it's called World of Coke. It is. It is. There's a beautiful Georgia Aquarium right next door to that. So it's a great place to bring families and good place to visit. Well, I love Atlanta. So Kathy, I would, you know, I understand you were in really the IT world. You were in sales before when you were at IBM. And I understand you had an opportunity to take a nice exit package and then decide to switch to careers. Why did you decide to switch careers to real estate? Well, at the time, I had little kids and thought, oh, real estate. You know, you can kind of set your own hours, do your own thing. I'll try real estate. Well, anybody that's in the business knows that, yes, you are very flexible unless you have a client, especially an out of town client. And then your time is there time. But it did work out well to just be able to pick up my daughters a little bit more often and just give me the opportunity to be a mom a little bit more often. So it was a good move. And I, you know, I loved IBM. It was a great place to learn. It was a great place to start my career. I came with them right out of college. And what I've realized about real estate is there's even so much more growth opportunity, both personally in terms of training and growth opportunities there as well as income. IBM kept me, I was on commission, but if you sold too much too early in the year, they would just raise your quota and you'd be back making the same money. So it was, it was very tightly controlled and real estate, you know, this, as people say, the sky's the limit and that there is no ceiling and no floor, but it's a great business. It is. And I also too want to put this in perspective because when you started the world, I mean, obviously the world changes every year, but it really has changed since when you started, you were pre-internet. So we're talking 1992. I mean, technically the internet was sort of around, but not, certainly wasn't adopted by the public. And I remember I went to college in 1994 and that was the first time that we started seeing web browsers and the ability to sort of, and it still wasn't widely used. So you were, I'm guessing we were on the phone a lot, which people who did not go up pre-1994, they don't know how to use the phone. They don't use the phone today. They don't communicate that way with their friends. I still think the phone is a really great way to communicate with people and it's kind of a bit of a lost art now, but I do think that, and even though people may not be as accustomed to being on the phone as they once were, I think we have this yearning to actually interact a voice to obviously we could do FaceTime and there's ways to do voice and picture at the same time. But I imagine you probably still pick up the phone quite a bit. Is that a fail? I do, as a matter of fact, I'd set a goal to make 10 calls every day and a lot of those end up being voicemail and you know, there's always this question, should I leave a voicemail, should I not? And I just choose to leave the voicemail. I think if someone does take the time, it's nice for them to hear my voice and maybe it's a little more personal. I use text a lot too though. There is something to be said about a phone call and that's also one of the nice things about being on the phone these days is you are going to get a lot of voicemails because you know, you get to choose now who you want to speak to and it's really, I think, made the phone a lot easier to use as a... I agree. Because you're like, well, I'm probably going to get a voicemail and then you get to leave a lovely message and my thought in Kathy, I know you're right, it's like, are they even going to hear the message? I think most people listen. I don't know. I mean, I'd be curious to see stats on this because maybe I'd be wrong, but I, it depends on the age range, I think. Yeah, but if you're listening to our podcast, you're a REALTOR. You should be listening to your voicemails because there may be some business in there. But I understand the idea of like, God, am I just wasting my time leaving voicemails? I don't think so because, for example, Kathy, if you called me on my birthday to wish me a happy birthday, for example, you just, it came up in your CRM, I probably wouldn't answer the phone, not because I don't like you, but because it's my birthday and I probably don't want to answer the phone. But maybe the next day or later on that day when I go back to listen, I would, I would very much go, that was sweet of her, that was nice. So for those that are like, ooh, I'm a little nervous talking, most people aren't going to pick up, but you can still leave them a nice thoughtful message. What I realized too, DJ, is when I do get people, I find out things that otherwise, I would never have found out. You know, somebody's been sick in their family or they've just gotten some kind of news. It's amazing and that's one call maybe out of 20, but if I hadn't made the call, I would never know. So I'm always like, oh, I'm so glad I made that call today. Well, it's true too because a lot of times, we think, well, how else do we get our news about people in our lives while we might look on social media? And when things are maybe not going well for a family or they're going through some sort of difficult time, maybe they're not posting about that on Facebook. Some people do, a lot of people don't. And so you might not know unless you picked up the phone and reached out. So let's talk about how you did get started pre-internet, right? Like you still had to go out and prospect and obviously, you know, we're talking about a long time ago, but I think, you know, a lot of the ways in which you probably prospected or built your business then still are applicable today, because I think fundamentals typically don't change. So I'm just curious, you know, back in the early 90s when you were starting this new career, how did you grow your business where you didn't have a background of being in real estate? Well, one of the first things I did when I got into the business, even before I got in, I had an IBM discount to buy a laptop and I bought a laptop and I loaded everybody that I knew into a database. So just, you know, that's the bare fundamentals and that has not changed today. If people, that's how you get started as you build a database. So I did that. You know, we had computers that would access. So when I started, I called expired listings for sale by owners. Those were out on a computer. You had to go to the office to get it, you know, to key it in and you could see the listings that are coming up, but you had to go into the office to do it. So that that is very different. But a lot of it was the same, same old, same old, I'm getting on the phone and call those expires. I eventually got to the point where I decided that really wasn't what I wanted to, where I wanted to live and that expired FSBO world. So I ended up doing much more of a referral based business once I got a little traction going. So yeah, I, I, but I think even though you're like, oh, the expires and for sale by owners aren't for me. And I think most agents probably have a similar experience with for sale by owners. You have to be a special kind of personality, I think, to be able to withstand some of the difficulties of calling expires and and for sale by owners, they are tough calls or they can be tough, of course. But certainly the kinder, or nice to say kinder, I'm sorry, the gentler approach is the working by referral made, you know, famous, well, made famous by a lot of people. But in the real estate industry, Brian Baphini is sort of associated with working by referral, lived the easy life, his one of his slogans. I know you're a fan of Baphini systems, I am as well. And you, you've not just worked with Baphini and his company, but other other systems too. But how important was it? Because I know you really dove into this. Probably I'm guessing getting the training at IBM where training is so important and there's such a white glove firm that you probably sort of thought, I got to get my knowledge up. And so talk about going to conferences and the importance of that for you in those early days. In the company that I was with had good basic training in terms of, you know, when you're getting started and what's the contract and what do you need to know. But for anything more advanced, I found I had to travel somewhere and learn. And that stood in my personality so well. I'm very learning based. I love learning new things. I think if I didn't, if I stopped learning in this business, I would not want to do it anymore. But even after all these years, I feel like I learned something new every day. But I would go to conferences. I went to, there was a guy named Howard Britton that assembled all these top agents from all over the country. And I went to that. I went to Baphini. I went to some other trainers as well. Just learning and trying to figure out what fit me and what felt right. And then my style now is a mixture of a lot of different trainers that I've heard over the years. My core is Baphini that just working by referral. That's the core. And I still love that system. And you know, you can add on top of that, add the videos, add, add all the fun things. But at the core, it really needs to be, in my opinion, it needs to be about relationship and digging deeper and going deeper with people serving them at its deeper level as we can. Could not agree with you more. I apologize our internet. It may be a little choppy. So if anyone's, if I'm choppy, anyone I apologize. But I absolutely agree with you, Kathy. You know, I was thinking about the Brian Baphini when what I liked about what I liked about Brian Baphini is he came up the idea basically and there's a lot of different principles of his teachings. But I've always loved the idea of sending an item, he calls them items of value, right? And he says basically, you know, you really should be giving your prospects to clients something of value every single month or whatever the the time commitment is or the duration is. But it's really important because you really always want to be sort of giving people things where they're like that was thoughtful, that was helpful, that that really is something information or something I can use. And he was a little bit ahead of the curve on that because now we know that like social media is all about providing content. You know, it's all about, sorry, all about providing value through content. And like, you know, if we expect people to watch our videos on Facebook or TikTok or wherever they may be, they better be pretty, at least nothing else entertaining, but better than that, hopefully providing some actual information that people can use. And Baphini was one of the first people I saw a sales trainer that was like, this is the way to people's hearts. Obviously, there's more to it than just that. But I have always been a huge fan of that. Curious to get your thoughts on the items of value. Yeah, I mean, I think now most of us have transitioned into more of an email and or as you pointed out, social media, video messages. He still provides monthly, the mailers, things you never know what works for certain people. So, well, you have built a referral based business and everyone, now I shouldn't say everyone, I would say most agents I have spoken to during my career in this industry about 13 or 14 years, almost everyone I meet says they want a referral based business. So that is obviously a common goal for a lot of agents. How long did it take you to do that? And what were some of the ways in which you began to transition away from making the cold calls to how do I get other people to market for me? Again, I think it goes back to building relationships. When someone knows and trusts another person, they are, if they have an opportunity, they will, you'll be the one that they recommend to their friends. So I think it's nothing magic about it. It's just getting in front of people. To this day, we still do a lot of lunches. I have lunch with someone almost every day of the week, coffees, just being in relationship with people. Let me drill down on that. I apologize, Kathy. This is really great because having lunch every day with somebody is something that all the hundreds of episodes I've done. I think you may be the first to talk about that specific sort of strategy. And can you talk a little bit about who you choose to take the lunch, what you talk about? Because this would be super helpful to our audience. Yeah. Yeah. So I would say those falls into two camps. Number one is past clients or prospect, somebody that I'm working with or have worked with. So that is one whole group. That's a pretty easy group because what do you talk about? You talk about their life, their families, the old forward family occupation, recreation, and dreams. It's all about getting to know them better. That's one bucket. The other bucket is trusted advisors. This has been a focus of mine over the last few years to try to get to know more estate attorneys, more wealth advisors, CPAs, divorce attorneys. So those people have the opportunity to refer multiple people. So to the extent that I can build a relationship there, the opportunity is just much greater than an individual who might have a friend who needs to buy or sell real estate. So I really do a lot of both. The trusted advisor is a really fun thing to do once you kind of get your feet wet with it. And they get my sane marketing that I'm sending to everybody else. At first I was like, okay, I've got to send something real. Just for them. Just for them. That's real, you know, that's real professional or real business, not fun. But they like fun things too. So I kind of had to get over the axe. It's just too much work to do two different things. When I'm meet with them, I may bring something more professional, some statistics or questions for them on their business, but the basic marketing is the same. So that's been fun. I'm not actually getting ready to start something I'm really excited about. I'm starting a group of women who are what I would call trusted advisors. And I'm hoping, we're having our first meeting coming up, but I'm hoping to meet once a quarter with this group and really build strong bonds. There's a financial advisor. There's a high-end insurance broker, a state attorney CPA. So I think it has a lot of potential and recommend anybody could do that, whether it's women or men or both. Those are all amazing professions to consider, to add to your professional, you know, service or professional network, I should say, because you're absolutely right. Those are people that are oftentimes dealing with life events, which typically may result in a transition of home, people moving in, people moving out, selling, buying, divorce attorneys are the most obvious example of that. But you know, you're right, a state planning attorney, as you mentioned. Some of my best business in the last year has been from a state attorneys. So such a smart idea. And oftentimes, a overlooked specialty for REALTORS. We think divorce, divorce, divorce, yes, and a state planning attorneys as well, because of course, those are, and you know, you could also too, I think possibly, there's just a weird idea that maybe isn't a good one. But people who work in mergers and acquisitions as well may, if it's, they work locally, they may be having companies that are moving in, moving out. So there's maybe some opportunities there as well. But I agree that having that professional network is awesome, because you can basically share clients and refer and say, I've got a great estate planning attorney. And by the way, everybody needs a great estate planning attorney. It's a really important thing, you know, and when somebody's going through a family change, having a good divorce attorney, obviously, is important as well and a good accountant and all of these things. So, Kathy is so, this is such a great point. I'm sort of sticking on it for a moment because I really want to sink in. Kathy, thank you for that. I really, everyone out there, yes, have lunch with your clients and your prospects. And yes, yes, yes, always do that. And let's add in some professional people where you can actually help their business. And I think the best way to have those conversations is say, hey, I would like to learn more about your business. Mr. or Mrs. estate planning attorney, what can I do? I have clients. Here's what my clients are like. Here's what they do. Would they be of benefit to you? What can I provide to you first? And then hopefully it becomes a reciprocal scenario. Exactly. Yep. Yep. What else did you do, too? So, we talked about sort of this networking staying in touch with your sphere, taking them out, seeing them face to face, also doing the same creating this networking group that you have and also just these trusted advisors. What I want to ask, because we talk about this a lot, and I know this isn't a, probably a really easy answer for this. So, I'm going to give you a little bit of a tougher question only just to see what you might answer, because we talk about, in real estate, we hear this phrase a lot, people who know, like, and trust us are the ones most likely to work with us. This is working by referral. No, like, and trust. We hear that over and over again. But I also think that I believe that trust is earned. So, I'm curious on, yes, you have to earn the no, like, and trust part. How are you, because you obviously do earn it, and you have earned it. What do you do during, when you're working with a client that would eventually get them to say, not just, you know, hey, I had a good transaction, a closed, et cetera, but I really, really like Kathy. I really felt she did a good job for me. I imagine you have certain standards in your business that lead to the no, like, and trust. I'm guessing. Yes, I know that we do, and we're always working on trying to improve that. I mean, it's boiled. To me, a lot of it just is so basic. It's communication. Yeah, pick up the phone when it rings. Yeah, it's being in touch. It's making sure that the client's needs are answered. And my husband and I work together. He works with buyers, and I work with sellers, and I do most of the lead generation. He is incredible about being patient, and spending, I hear him spending hours and hours on the phone with people explaining things in the inspection, or explaining, you know, the appraisal issues, or, you know, whatever it is, it's that taking the time with them. And he's, honestly, he's much more patient than I am. So he's in a good role, but I think that that's what people need. And it's not necessarily the first time buyers, some of the high end buyers need just as much as anybody else. So I think that that's part of it, just taking time and building, building that trust, and doing what you say you're going to do. I have a great assistant who is there. And does she ever drop the ball? Do I ever drop the ball? Of course, occasionally, but for the most part, we do what we say we're going to do. And then we love to stay in touch with people afterwards too. And I think that's really a lot of times where you build referrals is, you know, it's not just one and done. And, you know, you're on to the next. You're calling them and checking on them and making sure we love to stay in touch with people on an ongoing basis. I always say, you know, what should get in our web? You can't get out. Until you say stop. Exactly. And nobody probably ever does that because. No one ever has. Yeah, of course. Of course. And you know, it's really important too. You said something very profound now, which again, it's it's back to a fundamental of in between the sales. How what are we doing in between sales to stay in touch with that client? Because they're probably not moving for another, I don't know, seven years, five, seven years, whatever the source. Or more. And but we want to make sure that when they are ready and we won't know when that is necessarily, we want to make sure we're top of mind. And so this idea of reaching out in between is really, it's I think it's a lot simpler than people make it because it could be as easy as somebody bought a home from you. Call them a month in. Hey, how did the move and go? How is everything new? Good? Any problems? Just want to be call me if you have any. If you need anything, I've got a network of people I can connect you to. It really, that could be almost the call every year. If nothing else you want to talk about is how's the home? How's everything going? What's going on with family? Everything good? It just it can just be a check-in really. Yeah, really. Yep. I used to, I remember I this is a I'll make this story very short and I will tell you this sounds really silly but it made me feel very special. When I was in high school, I had a friend who had an older brother who went to MIT for college. He was like the genius of all of our friends. He was, yeah, anyway. So he went to MIT and he says, Oh, I'm taking a class by Dr. Amar or a mere Bose, the guy who created Bose sound. So Bose speakers. And he said, if you want to buy any Bose speakers, we get a discount. So anyway, because he was in the class. So I bought some speakers through my friend and whatever, cheap speakers, I mean, great speakers, but inexpensive. It wasn't like a big purchase, a couple hundred bucks, whatever. And every year after that for five years, Bose would call me once a year and say, just checking in, how are the speakers performing? And I was like, it blew my mind and stopped doing it. Amazing. Right now, I'm sure probably because it was purchased through his class. Maybe I got put a special category of like, make sure to take care of these people, but it sounds silly, but it really made me feel important. I don't, I have never met another company that does that. And that was 1993, maybe. So so anyway, this is a point back to calling. Yeah. Playing about the house, all you had to do is call and say, how's everything going? What's going on? Simple. Simple. But but you said, I'm so okay. So in between sales, we want to stay in touch. When you're working with a client, when you're in a transaction, let's say nothing's happening, you get no activity on a listing. Let's just say as an example, no new interest. Let's say a week goes by, what are you doing? Or are you doing anything to talk to the seller to say, okay, here's what's happening or what is your philosophy around that? DJ, that is the worst. The worst time when nothing's happening. And you know, Atlanta, the market has been so good that we haven't, we're still not experiencing that, but I believe me, I've been through that. I'm I'm sure live through, I live through the recession. So, you know, I think that in normal times, before too many days go by, you're getting a message from the market. The market, oh, we say the market will talk back. If we're not getting showings, if we're not getting offers, interest, then the market is telling us something. So, I think just planning the seed, obvious, I'm maybe this is an obvious, but it goes without saying that, okay, here's what I have been doing. You know, here's where your listing has been, how many hits you've had on the website, et cetera. So, a report to them, but then I think even after a week, we start planning the seeds for pricing, a pricing adjustment. Unless it's just like the recession or something like that, I think that normally, if a house isn't getting any activity, that's that's the message we need to be getting to the client. Does that make sense? Yeah, it does. It makes perfect sense. And are, I know that there can be some call reluctance or reluctance to pick up the phone when nothing is happening. Even, you know, a few days maybe where nothing's happening, what are you doing to keep the buyer or seller informed, even when there's not much to report, because I know a lot of agents don't maybe aren't as proactive when things aren't happening. I once had asked a top producer here in Chicago, so silly, but I said, why do you think she's number two in all of Chicago? And I said, why do you think out of 40,000 agents here number two? And she goes, I call my clients every week and tell them what's going on. And I said, well, and she goes, that's kind of it. And she goes, DJ, you'd be surprised. Very few agents do that. Yeah, really. And I would not claim to be perfect at that by any means. But again, just picking up the phone and touching base. And even when things are happening, I think that people just want to hear from you. I listed a new house yesterday and we've got some showings lined up. And I plan to just touch bases with them and say, you know, they're out of town actually, so they don't know precisely what's going on. But just to say, you know, we've had these showings. This first one said they weren't interested, but we know we've got some more lined up for the weekend. Just that communication. And honestly, I'm not always the best at it, but it's a goal to be more in communication. And I think people appreciate it. They never mind. When you've got their house on the market or a house for them under contract, I don't think you can call them too often. I don't think you can over, overdo it. Or they'll let you know if you're overdoing it. Yeah. And odds are, they're probably not going to say, stop communicating with me about this transaction. Right. And so that brings up a point that, you know, the best thing to start off with is to ask how you want to be communicated with. Do you want to have a phone call? Do you want me to text you? Do you want me to email you? So then the person who says, I want you to call me, they're not going to mind if you're calling. So we need to, we need to continue to do that. We kind of come and sometimes we kind of forget on that. But you know what I love about top producers? Is they say these really profound things, but to them it's like, like, I'm going to get a phone call. That question said something incredibly important, which was ask your clients, how do you prefer to be communicated? Would you like a phone call? Would you rather have a text? You know, is it okay if I leave a voice mail? Do you know what, what are the hours you want me to call you? When do you not want me to bother you? These these are the ones that just this is what she knows, but a lot of agents don't know this. So remember, the problem, so there's the golden rule, which is true. You want to be treated. The platinum rule is like, other people, they want to be treated. That's you have to ask questions to get that. So Kathy, again, seems like a small thing you said, maybe to you, but really, really profound. Don't just assume everyone communicates in the same manner because they don't. What are we doing to celebrate? Or what are you in your, oh, I'm sorry, I wanted to mention this other thing. You said that was really, really important because Kathy is very self-aware. She said at the beginning, you know, there's certain things I'm not as strong at, which is why her husband fills in those challenges. So she talked to Kathy, had mentioned she maybe isn't the most patient person, and that's not a negative. That's just part of your personality. You're good at some things, and other things you're weaker at. And maybe patients isn't always something that you can just learn to be more patient. So what Kathy said is instead of just while I'm going to fight against this, and do it, I'm going to get somebody who's really, really good at that because it is important that I have somebody that's super patient, and she has her husband step in. So what is the lesson from this? Well, we know that teams are on the rise, and look, the truth is you just can't do everything. You just can't. You're not going to be good at everything. So I love the fact that you have a, I mean, your husband, great, good thing that his skill set is different than yours, because you guys can then compliment each other and you go, oh, you know, this person's going to need some patients, you know, husband, you take care of this one, and it works really well. And then that client gets everything they want. Right. And we intentionally, when he, he joined me in the business a few years ago, and I never wanted there to be a situation where we would be like, oh, you said you were going to call him, no, you said you were going to call him and nobody's called him. So we have a very, very clear definition, Bob works with buyers. I work with the sellers. And occasionally we still are talking about our clients. And we know what's going on. And occasionally we'll, we'll be involved in in the other side, but for the most part, it's very well delineated. And that has worked very well for us. And that's that's fantastic. I'm fortunate that he loves doing the buyer. It's not everybody does. Well, and typically people who who are working agents that are working with buyers typically do need more patients because those transactions tend to take longer. And obviously there's a lot more that can go wrong on the buy side. Yep. Yep. Yeah. Yeah. And it is, it is great though that you do have somebody, your husband, of course, in this case, that's able to, to step in and, and help out in, in that way, and make, make it so that you don't say, well, I'm not really a buyer's agent. No, my husband, he's, he's the buyer's agent and he'll take awesome care of you. What, what are you, do you do any client appreciation events? I'm curious if you've started doing that or if you're working on that, or if those are going in your business. We love parties. My husband says that we are a and event company posing as a real estate company. You know, it's funny. I asked that question and I was like, I hope she's doing client appreciation. Well, she's going to be like, yeah, we, we don't do that. And because I had no knowledge, I'm like, she has to do this. And so I'm so glad. We love it. Oh, we love it. We love it. And we do all kinds of things. We, we love having dinner parties. We love having six people around the table and just breaking bread. That's really where you get to know people and and we like mixing people up that don't know each other. And sometimes we'll have people that know each other. So we do all kinds of things. We'll do some medium-sized parties where maybe we'll have 20 people over for drinks or something. And then a few times a year, we have a big event. We're planning right now a big pizza party. We have a person that a company that comes with this big wood wood fired grill and they grill the pizzas. They're delicious. We'll have wine and beer. This year I've got a gelato company coming to serve gelato. And we have a DJ and it's all in our driveway. So it's we're praying for good weather. But it's it's lots of fun. We've done a few, we've done it several times before and it's always a fun party. So that's one of our biggest parties. We will probably have 200 people here altogether and my husband doesn't know that yet. So I don't tell him. But you know we do pies. We do a pie party at Thanksgiving and we've done movie parties. We've done a little bit of everything. We love to travel and when we get back from a trip say to France, for example, we will last year we had a French wine and cheese party. So you know some things like that. Well, that's a great idea. So you go on a trip and I wasn't sure where you were going with that. So that's amazing. You go on a trip, you know, you experience the culture of another country and then you bring that culture back with you. So that is I have never heard of anyone doing that. That is a very fun. It's very fun. Yeah. Oh my gosh, brilliant. What a great thing. What a great I always love these. It's always I've been doing this for five or six years. Anytime I hear something new and I know it's not new. It's not like you're the first person to ever do that. I just have never heard of it. And so it's new to me and I love it. So that's you see it's it's a lot about activity, right? It's it's just like you were saying I make 10 phone calls every day. I bet most REALTORS don't even do that. And I'm not here to criticize everyone. I'm just here to challenge people to realize this is what tout producers do. They pick up the phone or some version of that. Are you are you doing a lot on social media or is that something that you know you're not as connected to? So almost two years ago I hired a marketing gal who was helping me and she is guiding me. She does she actually does most of the posts. I'll do I'll do some myself just personal ones but she's doing the business ones. And I originally came to you through Kim Rittberg and Kim is helping me with video trying to get me we're going to work on messaging this fall and really trying to create messages that resonate and that going back to your original point of value. It's not just about nothing. It's about something that hopefully will no message is going to appeal to everyone all the time. But if we can just make it something that's that's interesting and informative to a number of people. I think I'm real excited about that to try to kind of take it to the next level. I also think too and by the way I plug for Kim Rittberg. She has a her own series on our podcast. We love Kim. She's our social media expert. And I didn't realize that you were you came through by way of her. So I am so excited because Kim is one of my favorite people. I think I've just about ever met. So I am I just absolutely adore her and I encourage everyone to listen to her series on our show. Just look for for Kim's Kim's episodes. She is a real gem. And yeah, you're talking about value. I think because I know there's this a lot of us in this industry have a perfectionist mindset. We want our headshots to look perfect or we want our by the way. I'm going to divert from what I was saying. I was just at a Zillow conference the last two days I showing time, which is owned by basically by Zillow. I was at a conference for them. I was fortunate enough to get to go. And they said they showed a statistic that is so interesting. Speaking of headshots and it just came to me, I totally forgot. This is amazing. And I wish I could show people this although it's a podcast. So when most people wouldn't be able to see it anyway. But they showed some data that suggests that headshots are done. Nobody wants to see headshots anymore. What they want to see is a still a professional photo. But what they actually want to see is you being captured doing something that you enjoy, something that is a passion for you, whether it's real estate, maybe you play guitar, maybe you're into whatever. Maybe you just want, you know, you're a great mom or whatever you're into. They actually people, they had data to support this. They said, nobody wants to see the perfect airbrushed photo anymore. They want to see you in action, which makes sense because we follow people on social media and we see them doing what they do. So for anyone out there who's thinking about getting a new headshot, yes, get a new headshot, obviously get that and get some shots of you doing other things and people actually find that to be more inviting and more real and more authentic. So just a little plug from something I learned from from Zillow last couple days. But Kathy, sorry to interrupt you. That's really interesting. Really interesting. Yeah. Oh, here's another one real quick. Sorry, just because it's coming to me. Use white linens. If you can on your listing presentations for the master bedroom, sorry, for the primary bedroom, use white linens if possible because Zillow has found that by using a white, like a duvet or white, you know, comforter, 30% more clicks versus a colored, different color than white. I mean, crazy, weird things. So if I was an agent, I might just buy like a king size comfort and keep it in my trunk. So anyway, okay, back to Kathy. I'm so sorry. I just, I got no ideas. You're going to be good ideas. Well, I need to learn from you because you're really so much further along the path. And I'm Kathy, what? Let's talk about boundaries in the sense of, you know, we know that mothers parents know this as well as REALTORS know this. If we don't set some sort of boundaries for our, you know, for our people in our lives, especially if we have children, they may challenge those boundaries. Clients can do the same thing. How do you handle a 10 o'clock and that? Not everyone. Do you set certain expectations for your clients so that they know what to expect if they reach out at like an odd hour? I wouldn't say that I typically say, okay, you can call me between eight and six. I don't have that. I know some agents have that on their voice mail and all that. But honestly, I usually got a bet around 10 and I'm not answering the phone after that. But I do think that it's for me and my husband, it's more event or situation driven. I answered the phone last night because I just got a contract worked out at eight o'clock and the guy had a question. So I answered the phone at quarter of 10 and my know my husband has been up to midnight with people going, you know, when there's a deadline on an inspection or something like that. So I wouldn't say we have any hard and fast. Okay, these are our business hours. I don't think there's anything wrong with doing that. We're at a point in life when we don't have any kids at home. So it really takes the pressure off of that. And we are working on no phones at the dinner. You know, that kind of thing. That's sort of basic. But if a message comes in late at night that you don't want to handle, you've been a REALTOR for a very long time. Can we tell the rest of our audience that in most cases, it can wait. It can wait till the morning. Oh yeah, there's nothing wrong with voice mail. You can get it tomorrow. That's absolutely right. And the problem with text messages is there's no end to a text message conversation. Right. Phone calls have a start and yeah, text messages have a start. They don't have an end. Yeah, that's a very good point. I never thought about that. But yeah, if you start it, unless you say, I'm sorry, go to bed now. Night night. Yes. Which by the way, is an absolutely reasonable thing if the person is expecting some sort of response. You could just say, oh, I'm headed to bed first thing in the morning, I got it or whatever. Yeah. Who can, who can, you know, argue with that? Kathy, we should also mention too that, you know, our show is a show four agents by agents, listen to by agents as well. So, you know, we also want to promote referrals and we know that Kathy works in downtown Atlanta. She is and the nearby surrounding suburbs as well. But Atlanta is a hotbed for people moving in and out. Lots of big companies are there. And if anyone does have people moving into Atlanta, in particular, the metro area and the close suburbs, you know, Kathy is a great resource. So, Kathy, if there are agents out there that either maybe want to connect with you because you might have people that are moving from Atlanta, like down in Florida or wherever they may be retiring to. Absolutely. Yeah. So, what's the best way if somebody wants to connect with you that they can reach out? My website is just simplelemontime.com, l-a-m-o-n-t-m-o-n-team.com. I'm Kathy at LeMontime.com. I'm on Facebook Insta, all those good places. And I think you said you were going to put it in the show notes too. I will. Absolutely. But we, I really, you know, Kathy, it's funny. I was just sort of reflecting on what we've talked about today. And there are lots of great tips here that Kathy provided. So, on behalf of our audience, I mean, really, this was a chock full episode of actionable strategies by somebody who's been in real estate for over 30 years now. Congratulations, by the way. Did you do the math right on that? Yes. Yeah. That is impressive. And not, and Kathy has seen, oh, by the way, Kathy, you've been through some ups and downs last question. Are, are we worried right now about the market at all? Are we worried about interest rates? Are, are we like, we've seen this before? It's going to be fine. We are going to be fine. And as you pointed out on the big follow-up, Brian Bafini, he is very optimistic about what's going to happen with the rates and the market. His message right now is to focus on listings. We need to be listing, listing, listing, and learning. You know, if you don't have listings, go to a class and learn how to do them better. So just investing yourself, invest in your people. And really, he says we're going to have a great 2024. So, good things ahead. And for anyone out there who's like, how do I get more listings? There's a million ways to do it. But one one way that I think would be particularly applicable today is and Kathy can tell me if I'm nuts and wrong because I might be. But, um, well, I'm definitely nuts, but I'm also, I may be wrong. That's for sure. I'm definitely crazy. But, um, you know, people are always interested to know what their home value is, right? This is why Zillow became Zillow. It was the Zestimate. It wasn't the home search. It was actually the Zestimate. And the Zestimate then gave birth really to their home search. So, you know, people, whether, whatever we think of the Zestimate, people like to see the Zestimate, whatever, however accurate we think it is or not, this is a great opportunity to take a lesson from Zillow's playbook and maybe reach out to people who, whether they were your client or not, hey, I thought I would show you what I believe your home is approximately worth right now. Would you be interested in seeing that? I mean, I would always be interested in seeing that. So, I don't know if you do CMAs for your clients, I'm sure you would. I did one yesterday as a matter of fact, yes. Mm-hmm. And, and by the way, as much as I love, I think Zillow's a great company and I, I like Zillow a lot of agents do not. I understand and respect that as well. But, if I'm looking for an actual CMA, I don't, I don't use Zest, I use Zestimate as like a starting point. Like, okay, that's what Zillow thinks. But, I want somebody like Kathy showing me exactly what she thinks after 30 years of business because she knows the market better than, you know, an algorithm likely could. So, this is a great opportunity, guys, to exercise your, your experience and, and, you know, show people, hey, this is what I think right now, um, great opportunity there. But, on behalf of our audience for all the great tips and advice that Kathy provided, we say thank you to Kathy and her, her, her team, her husband's not on the call. But, we, we say thank you to him as well, um, for some of the tips that you mentioned that he has. And, on behalf of Kathy and myself, we'd be remiss if we didn't say thanks to the audience. Thanks for listening. Thanks for making me, thank you. And thanks for making it to the end of the episode. We just asked everybody to do two quick things for us. I know it's a lot to ask, but just tell, one thing, tell a friend, think of one other REALTOR that could benefit. This is a great episode. Send it to people that are struggling right now, agents that are like, what do I do? It's yes, send this to them. They'll get some great ideas. And also, please leave us a review. Whatever you're listening to the spot, guys, let us know what you think of the show. Um, constructive criticism is always important to us. We, we write that we do this episodes. We do the show for you. So please let us know how we can improve it and also what you like as well. Kathy, thank you so much. We are so honored to have you. You're a big deal.

You don't have it. That's something that comes with time and people like Kathy, I don't want to make you sound like you're older. Kathy, that is not what I'm saying. I don't think you're older, but just being in the business this long is is really a treasure. And it's no surprise that Kathy's a top producer.
