[00:01:27] Hello, and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real,
[00:01:35] the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents.
[00:01:39] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:01:41] I'm your guide.
[00:01:42] I'm your host through the show.
[00:01:43] And in just a moment, we're going to be speaking
[00:01:45] with new top producer, Erica Compos.
[00:01:49] And by the way, if you're new to the show,
[00:01:51] welcome, we're glad you're here.
[00:01:53] If you're returning, thank you for coming back.
[00:01:55] Also, as always, please tell a friend about the show
[00:01:58] let other agents know about us.
[00:02:00] I just got back from a market outlook here in Chicago
[00:02:04] where we had the National Association of REALTORS,
[00:02:06] Chief Economist, Dr. Lawrence Yoon,
[00:02:08] speaking on his predictions for 2024.
[00:02:10] Perhaps I'll do an episode on that myself.
[00:02:13] But it's gonna be a tricky year.
[00:02:15] So not as tricky as last year, hopefully,
[00:02:18] and he was actually fairly optimistic,
[00:02:20] but we're still gonna see relatively high rates this year,
[00:02:24] maybe dipping down into the lower sixes
[00:02:27] by the end of the year was his prediction.
[00:02:29] But regardless, this is gonna be a tricky year, just is.
[00:02:32] So let's help each other tell other agents about our show.
[00:02:35] Let us know if there's agents in your market
[00:02:38] where you're just like, I wonder how that person's doing it.
[00:02:41] Somebody who's really crushing it will reach out to them
[00:02:43] or they can reach out to us.
[00:02:44] But we wanna always continue to help our audience.
[00:02:47] We have the record number of listeners right now.
[00:02:49] So thank you for being here.
[00:02:51] Thank you for telling a friend.
[00:02:52] And let's just get to it, the main event.
[00:02:54] My conversation with Eric Acampus.
[00:03:10] All right, today my guest on the show is Erica Campos
[00:03:15] with Cold Well Banker in Chicago.
[00:03:17] Let me tell you more about Erica.
[00:03:20] And this is actually a really sort of unique episode for us.
[00:03:23] I'll tell you why in just a moment.
[00:03:24] But with over two decades of experience in insurance,
[00:03:28] finance, sales and customer service,
[00:03:31] Eric Acampus brings a wealth of knowledge
[00:03:32] and unique expertise to the table.
[00:03:35] She's a full-time REALTOR, member of National Association
[00:03:38] of course, Chicago Association and the resident
[00:03:41] real estate council.
[00:03:42] She's affiliated with Cold Well Banker in Oakland, Illinois.
[00:03:45] She services Chicago and the suburbs.
[00:03:47] Now, Erica's at 40 years old,
[00:03:49] Erica decided just recently to take her own leap of faith
[00:03:53] and dive headfirst into the world of real estate,
[00:03:56] leaving her nine to five behind as a financial literary coach.
[00:03:59] She joined Cold Well Banker with a fire in her eyes
[00:04:01] and a relentless dedication to succeed.
[00:04:03] I should mention that Erica just started practicing
[00:04:06] in the last, Erica was it last eight months, I believe?
[00:04:11] Yeah, about that like six, seven months.
[00:04:12] It was back in June.
[00:04:13] Six months, sorry.
[00:04:14] I was giving you more experience than you have.
[00:04:17] So six months.
[00:04:18] Yes, six months in change.
[00:04:21] I want to tell you more about Erica.
[00:04:22] I really shouldn't have asked her a question just yet,
[00:04:25] but I did, but I want you guys to hear this
[00:04:27] because this is really cool.
[00:04:28] Within her first six months,
[00:04:29] which she just just cleared six months,
[00:04:32] Erica closed an impressive four transactions
[00:04:35] as most of us remember our first six months.
[00:04:38] We probably didn't close four transactions.
[00:04:40] So congratulations to her,
[00:04:41] but this really proved her quick grasp
[00:04:43] of the real estate market and her ability to connect
[00:04:46] with clients.
[00:04:46] She didn't wait for the new year to even start making waves.
[00:04:50] Already this year, she closed a deal.
[00:04:52] By the way, the date that we're recording this
[00:04:54] is January 5th.
[00:04:56] So she already has a deal on the books
[00:04:57] a closed for 2024, congrats to her.
[00:05:00] But also, I want to also mention this
[00:05:02] because I think this oftentimes gets overlooked
[00:05:04] and forgotten about by REALTORS
[00:05:07] the longer they're in the business.
[00:05:08] So Erica's really dedicated herself
[00:05:10] to education in that first six months.
[00:05:12] So this are some of the accreditations
[00:05:14] that she has earned just within the last year.
[00:05:18] So she already is a pricing strategy advisor.
[00:05:22] She is also a property management trainer.
[00:05:24] She's gone through property management training,
[00:05:26] community investment corporation.
[00:05:28] She's real estate investing, working with investors.
[00:05:31] She is a financial literary coach,
[00:05:33] as we mentioned before,
[00:05:35] and she's a lead renovation, repair, and paint sort of expert.
[00:05:40] So she is doing a lot of different things
[00:05:42] and we're going to talk about why she's adding
[00:05:44] all of these designations
[00:05:46] and how they're helping her with her clients.
[00:05:48] But I want everyone to follow her
[00:05:50] on the various social channels, Facebook, Instagram,
[00:05:53] TikTok, LinkedIn.
[00:05:55] You can find her, well, LinkedIn,
[00:05:56] you just search for Erica Compos.
[00:05:58] But for all the others, she is REALTOR.erica.campos.
[00:06:03] And you can find her,
[00:06:04] we will have links to all of Erica's social media
[00:06:06] in the show notes.
[00:06:08] Erica, long intro, but welcome to the show.
[00:06:11] Thanks, CJ. Thank you.
[00:06:12] Thank you for having me.
[00:06:13] I am super excited that I got a chance to be on.
[00:06:18] I've been a fan of your channel for such a long time.
[00:06:23] Even before I decided to even enroll in real estate school,
[00:06:28] I would listen to your podcast.
[00:06:30] And it has been a true motivation for me to get my license,
[00:06:33] finally do it.
[00:06:34] Really?
[00:06:35] Well, yes.
[00:06:36] And while I was studying, I'd listen just to get
[00:06:40] everyone's perspective and what is going on
[00:06:43] in the real estate world.
[00:06:45] And again, it was just very motivational and inspirational
[00:06:47] and it's part of the motivation.
[00:06:49] That's a why I decided just go for it.
[00:06:51] Well, that, I am, boy, you've, you've, I am very surprised.
[00:06:57] I did not know any of this.
[00:06:59] So wow, that was, that was a lot to take.
[00:07:01] And thank you.
[00:07:02] It was, it's a real, it's a real honor to hear that.
[00:07:05] So thank you so much for sharing that.
[00:07:07] I was not expecting that.
[00:07:09] And we should also mention too that you are the,
[00:07:12] boy, you're really threw me off my game with that one.
[00:07:14] That one, that one hit, that one hit me pretty hard.
[00:07:16] Congratulations.
[00:07:17] 
[00:07:18] Well, I'm really proud of you as well because, you know,
[00:07:22] people don't usually have this kind of success
[00:07:24] in their first six months.
[00:07:25] And it wasn't handed to you.
[00:07:27] These are things you all earned.
[00:07:29] So I am, but I'm glad to hear that maybe I was a small part
[00:07:32] of that over the journey.
[00:07:34] And what I really want to talk about,
[00:07:36] I want to start with why the switch to real estate first.
[00:07:40] So you had this sort of, you know,
[00:07:42] traditional corporate life before.
[00:07:44] Why the switch?
[00:07:47] Well, it all started when I was 17 years old.
[00:07:50] I, I've been in, I was a insurance agent
[00:07:53] for a local state farm, you know, agent all state.
[00:07:56] And then eventually I went to work for brokerages,
[00:07:58] bigger companies, but I fell in love with the industry
[00:08:04] back then.
[00:08:04] I was 17 years old, started part time still finishing high school.
[00:08:08] And once I turned 18, I, you know,
[00:08:11] I became licensed for both property casualty life and health,
[00:08:14] passed them all the first time, same as my real estate license,
[00:08:18] which I know is a very difficult test.
[00:08:22] So, you know, again, I fell in love with the industry.
[00:08:24] I was always in contact with REALTORS
[00:08:28] and with loan officers and lenders.
[00:08:30] And I, I think it also comes naturally to me
[00:08:33] to understand this industry.
[00:08:36] You know, and I would always be on the phone
[00:08:37] with loan officers and processors and ask them,
[00:08:41] well, what's the, what's the interest rate now?
[00:08:43] What's going, what kind of conventional
[00:08:45] and FHA programs are happening?
[00:08:47] And so throughout my career,
[00:08:49] I, I learned a lot about risk management.
[00:08:52] So I would go out and inspect the property
[00:08:55] to make sure it would go through our underwriting,
[00:08:58] make sure that the house is not falling down,
[00:09:00] that what we are ensuring, right?
[00:09:02] So, you know, good structure for both the insurance company
[00:09:05] and foreign clients.
[00:09:07] And I think that goes a long way now as well with when I,
[00:09:11] I'm looking at houses with my clients,
[00:09:13] I'm able to detect you're going to need
[00:09:15] a roof in the next two years.
[00:09:16] You're going to need this furnace.
[00:09:19] It's a goner.
[00:09:20] You know, so I think my clients definitely,
[00:09:22] you know, love that about my experience.
[00:09:25] And then along the way, of course,
[00:09:27] you have to be a good salesperson
[00:09:29] because that was also hourly plus commission.
[00:09:32] And then you have to provide great customer service
[00:09:35] because you want to build that trust
[00:09:37] and you want them to continue coming to you as the expert.
[00:09:41] So I did that for about 17, 18 years.
[00:09:44] And in the midst of all that,
[00:09:47] I also was an educator.
[00:09:49] So I was building a little side business.
[00:09:51] Basically, I could say it was life skills,
[00:09:55] like a life skills educator teaching life skills
[00:09:58] and financial literacy since back then.
[00:10:01] And so I have a big education background too.
[00:10:04] I started teaching all over Chicago
[00:10:07] and high schools as well,
[00:10:09] financial literacy and life skills education.
[00:10:11] And I think all together with my experience
[00:10:16] and being so detailed and analytical
[00:10:18] and the plus education piece,
[00:10:20] I feel again that it's helped me transition into what I am now.
[00:10:26] And my last job, I was a financial literacy coach
[00:10:30] and I taught all over underserved communities
[00:10:34] and young adults, reentry folks.
[00:10:37] And that pretty much led me into real estate again.
[00:10:40] So I think it was just a lead way into that.
[00:10:43] And once I got licensed and I started doing open houses
[00:10:49] and I started getting clients right off the bat,
[00:10:51] I realized, okay, I don't know if I can juggle these two.
[00:10:55] And I don't like working for other people.
[00:10:58] I like to work for myself.
[00:11:01] And so I told my husband, listen,
[00:11:03] I really would love to focus on real estate.
[00:11:06] I know that I can hit the ground running,
[00:11:08] give me six months.
[00:11:10] If in six months, I don't sell one thing.
[00:11:13] I'll go work for somebody else, I guess.
[00:11:16] And six months out, you know,
[00:11:19] four transactions and then the fifth one this month
[00:11:22] and I have a couple more in the pipeline.
[00:11:25] So I guess the insurance and financial has always been
[00:11:30] in my life and I think I missed it for some time
[00:11:33] and now I'm back into that industry.
[00:11:36] So it's, I love it.
[00:11:39] I really love it.
[00:11:40] Yeah, it's very interesting.
[00:11:43] I think a lot about previous careers
[00:11:46] and how they relate.
[00:11:47] I'm always interested in thinking about, you know,
[00:11:50] how does somebody take skills from maybe,
[00:11:53] in this case, you had somewhat related careers
[00:11:56] but still weren't specifically, you know,
[00:11:58] super real estate focused,
[00:11:59] but the idea of customer service
[00:12:01] and being either a financial literacy coach
[00:12:04] or an insurance agent, these are all about,
[00:12:06] these are really service jobs in my mind.
[00:12:08] I know they're technically considered sales jobs,
[00:12:11] but I always think, you know, the best agents are the ones
[00:12:13] that serve the clients most effectively.
[00:12:15] And I think that does translate really well,
[00:12:18] customer service.
[00:12:18] So I imagine that skill that you honed over almost 20 years,
[00:12:24] probably served you very nicely
[00:12:25] when you stepped into real estate.
[00:12:27] Yeah, definitely did.
[00:12:28] I know that for me, my clients come first.
[00:12:31] I always go above and beyond for them.
[00:12:34] If I don't know something, I'm not afraid to say,
[00:12:36] you know what, let me get back to you.
[00:12:39] Let me find out.
[00:12:40] And so then I, then I'll go ask,
[00:12:42] I'll say someone for my brokerage.
[00:12:43] Sure.
[00:12:44] My managing broker, but it's very important to me.
[00:12:47] It's my reputation, but it's also important that the trust,
[00:12:51] I don't want to be known for real estate agents.
[00:12:56] We don't have a good reputation a lot of times, right?
[00:12:58] Some agents have made that for us, unfortunately.
[00:13:03] So I make sure that I go above and beyond.
[00:13:06] And even those clients that I've already closed deals with,
[00:13:10] I still contact them.
[00:13:12] I still ask how their house is coming along.
[00:13:14] I send them, you know, congratulations cards.
[00:13:16] Christmas cards, holiday cards.
[00:13:19] For Thanksgiving, I know it was only four,
[00:13:22] but I personally dropped off pumpkin pies
[00:13:25] with a thank you note in my business card
[00:13:28] to each and every one of my clients.
[00:13:31] So, and potential clients.
[00:13:33] So you just, you have to go above and beyond.
[00:13:35] And one of the things that I've listened to in your podcast
[00:13:38] and that I, I mean, I know myself is that clients
[00:13:42] can easily forget who their REALTOR was.
[00:13:46] You know, even who sold them their first house?
[00:13:48] I'm not going to be that agent.
[00:13:50] You're going to know who I am.
[00:13:51] And so even if I, I don't want to come across
[00:13:54] at the pain in the butt, right?
[00:13:55] But, you know, again, the holidays, birthdays.
[00:13:58] So I make sure I collect good information
[00:14:01] so that I can, you know, continue to communicate with them
[00:14:05] in more than just a business way.
[00:14:08] Like a person.
[00:14:10] Yeah, you just gave an idea just sprung forth
[00:14:13] from what you just said.
[00:14:15] So I want to share it with our audience,
[00:14:16] but I really going to credit Erica with this
[00:14:19] because it was her words that brought this up in my mind.
[00:14:22] That I was thinking about when somebody moves in,
[00:14:25] especially when, you know, somebody's buying a property.
[00:14:28] And whether it's their first property or not,
[00:14:30] I don't think it matters for this idea.
[00:14:33] But the idea that you were saying about how you're staying
[00:14:35] in touch after the sales, they don't forget about you.
[00:14:37] It's critical.
[00:14:38] Obviously we all know that.
[00:14:39] But sometimes it can be tricky to think about
[00:14:42] why to call somebody.
[00:14:44] And so I was just an idea that popped up as you were talking
[00:14:46] was that pretty much in every home,
[00:14:48] there's always an unfinished project of sorts, right?
[00:14:51] There's some sort of, you know, whether it's there,
[00:14:53] you have to redo a room or you want to do a bigger sort of thing
[00:14:57] or just cleaning out a closet or whatever project.
[00:15:00] There's, of course, everybody has lists of projects
[00:15:02] that are unfinished in there wherever they live.
[00:15:05] And I think too that would be a fun thing for agents
[00:15:08] to do once you sell them the home is reach out, you know,
[00:15:11] within that next year and say, hey, how's it going?
[00:15:13] How's the home as you had said?
[00:15:15] And then I probably would say, hey, do you have any projects
[00:15:17] that you're working on for the home?
[00:15:18] Just curious what you, if you're doing anything
[00:15:20] or things you want to do because the reason I'm asking
[00:15:22] is if you need any referrals, if you need, you know,
[00:15:26] if you're looking for a particular handyman
[00:15:27] or somebody to help you with this particular project,
[00:15:29] I've got people to talk to or at least I'll find
[00:15:32] good people for you.
[00:15:34] That would be a great reason to reach out
[00:15:36] and everyone's got a project that they need to do.
[00:15:38] So you just, you just spurn that within me.
[00:15:42] So I just wanted to share that.
[00:15:43] Let's, and I also want to say too, you are the, I believe,
[00:15:47] the newest agent to ever have been on our show.
[00:15:50] I should have mentioned that at the beginning
[00:15:52] because you are only six or, I guess, the year and year
[00:15:55] and seventh month now.
[00:15:56] So this is really a fun one for me
[00:15:58] because all of, really a lot of our listeners,
[00:16:01] it's not so much whether they're new,
[00:16:03] but they love, you know, our audience really loves
[00:16:06] sort of the new person's energy, right?
[00:16:09] The new REALTOR's energy because, you know,
[00:16:11] life has not kicked them around enough yet.
[00:16:14] So there's still a lot of optimism and excitement,
[00:16:17] but also you've just really hit the ground running.
[00:16:19] So tell us how you did it.
[00:16:21] You mentioned open houses.
[00:16:22] Was that sort of the first thing you did
[00:16:24] once you, once you, you know, joined Coldwell Banker?
[00:16:26] Was that a big deal to start getting out there
[00:16:28] and talking to clients or respective clients?
[00:16:31] Okay, well, one, I will say that I'm known to break records.
[00:16:35] So I've opened another record here.
[00:16:37] And all my other sales career,
[00:16:38] that I have broken records and have helped companies
[00:16:41] reach numbers that are impressive.
[00:16:44] So, you know, now I've broken another record
[00:16:46] and my goal is to break Coldwell Banker's record
[00:16:49] as the first, you know, Lewis A.J.
[00:16:50] to bring in so many at a certain time.
[00:16:53] I would like to hit Rookie of the Year,
[00:16:55] which I think I have one more transaction
[00:16:58] and they give you a year, 18 months to do it
[00:17:00] and I'm doing it hopefully in seven a month.
[00:17:02] So I'm hoping that's a record there.
[00:17:04] But so how did, how did I start?
[00:17:07] Well, one, I have a very big sphere of influence.
[00:17:11] I always say that because in one of my prior businesses,
[00:17:15] I've met thousands of people.
[00:17:17] And I make sure they followed me all
[00:17:19] through all the social medias.
[00:17:21] So I am very consistent as much as I can.
[00:17:24] And so when I decided to go into real estate
[00:17:26] and signed up for schooling,
[00:17:28] that is when I started posting like,
[00:17:30] okay, I'm studying for my real estate exam.
[00:17:32] This is what I do.
[00:17:32] This is, you know, I started giving out advice on how to study.
[00:17:38] And then when I passed,
[00:17:39] I took a picture of me celebrating downtown Chicago,
[00:17:43] you know, with the Chicago hot dog.
[00:17:46] And so, you know, so I think what helped me too
[00:17:50] is just announcing it out there,
[00:17:51] like being consistent about what I'm doing.
[00:17:54] And believe it or not, people are watching, you know,
[00:17:57] you do make a difference, you do empower people,
[00:18:00] you motivate and inspire others.
[00:18:03] And like I said, you didn't know, you know,
[00:18:05] how you inspired me.
[00:18:06] And so this is why I said we don't know it until we put it out there.
[00:18:10] And so I think that helped me a lot because again,
[00:18:13] before I even decided what broker I was going to join,
[00:18:17] I already had people asking me to be their agent, you know.
[00:18:21] And so, so then for me,
[00:18:24] I had already been interviewing a couple of companies.
[00:18:27] And I decided on code will bank a realty and no clause,
[00:18:30] it just felt right, you know,
[00:18:32] in terms of community is so important.
[00:18:35] So I needed and wanted an office environment
[00:18:38] that I can go into to talk to other agents.
[00:18:41] I'm very talkative and I love sharing my experiences
[00:18:45] and learning from others and vice versa.
[00:18:47] So that's what I needed.
[00:18:49] That, so I interviewed there.
[00:18:52] And I really fell in love with their mission
[00:18:56] and their support for newer agents and their programs.
[00:19:00] And their, you know, CBU universities,
[00:19:03] what they call it, or CBU university.
[00:19:05] Amazing training, you know.
[00:19:07] So that I believe also helped me hit the ground running.
[00:19:11] Code will banker is,
[00:19:13] Code will banker is very well known.
[00:19:16] And I also wanted to make sure I joined a well known company as well.
[00:19:21] So yeah, I mean, just, just walking and just inviting
[00:19:25] my sphere of influence to follow me through this journey,
[00:19:30] I think has helped me quite a bit
[00:19:32] in addition to my experience and expertise.
[00:19:35] Yeah, I think that's right.
[00:19:37] So you did what everybody is told to do
[00:19:41] and most people don't do,
[00:19:43] which is start telling everybody that you're a REALTOR
[00:19:46] and start conditioning them, which takes time
[00:19:48] because they were used to seeing you in different capacity.
[00:19:51] Obviously the finance world and insurance world,
[00:19:54] but certainly not the real estate world specifically.
[00:19:57] So you had to educate,
[00:19:59] I guess this goes back to education,
[00:20:00] or really you had to start educating
[00:20:03] not only the people in your life to know that you're a REALTOR,
[00:20:06] but then you started educating them about real estate.
[00:20:08] So that's what's really great in social media
[00:20:11] is such an effective medium to do that with.
[00:20:15] So, and okay, so you told everybody you know
[00:20:19] from all your different previous careers,
[00:20:22] your sphere of influence, your friends, family,
[00:20:24] of course, previous clients, which is amazing
[00:20:27] because of course with your background and insurance,
[00:20:31] boy, that's a lovely group of people to say,
[00:20:34] oh, by the way, I am doing this other thing too
[00:20:37] and everyone's got to live somewhere.
[00:20:38] So I love that.
[00:20:39] Well, I want to talk about open houses
[00:20:41] because I feel that whether you had a sphere of influence
[00:20:45] or not and you did, but a lot of people don't,
[00:20:48] they move to a new city, they get their license,
[00:20:50] they're like, well, that doesn't relate to me,
[00:20:51] I'm not from here, but anybody can do an open house.
[00:20:55] And so let's talk about how to do it
[00:20:58] because we have had people write in sometimes and say,
[00:21:01] well, I know you guys talk a lot about every person
[00:21:03] you talk to says I should do open houses,
[00:21:05] but I don't have any listings.
[00:21:07] I'm a little bit too shy to ask other agents in my office
[00:21:11] can I please sit at, you know, do an open house for you?
[00:21:13] How did you do it?
[00:21:15] I'm curious like, what was the process for you?
[00:21:18] Well, one, I know that that was one of the lead generation,
[00:21:24] I wouldn't say, I don't know, like, tactic, I guess,
[00:21:27] that is easier for newer agents, right?
[00:21:30] And it doesn't matter if you have listings or not,
[00:21:33] obviously, especially as a newer agent, you are not.
[00:21:36] But so I'm not shy.
[00:21:37] I will ask you and I'm not afraid of rejection.
[00:21:42] Being an insurance industry and in sales,
[00:21:45] rejection is nothing anymore.
[00:21:47] You know, all right, onto the next, right?
[00:21:50] So for me, I would write an email and introduce myself
[00:21:53] as a new Cold War banker REALTOR to our existing offices.
[00:21:58] So we have multiple offices all over Illinois.
[00:22:00] So I said, hey, I'm bilingual, I have this experience,
[00:22:03] sales, customer service, you know, I'm professional,
[00:22:07] and if you need help with your open houses,
[00:22:11] I would love, you know, I would love to help you.
[00:22:14] And so I started getting people, agents reaching out,
[00:22:18] you know, from different parts of the city too.
[00:22:20] I was really, really.
[00:22:21] Oh yeah, especially within your office,
[00:22:24] within your company, you would be surprised.
[00:22:27] And agents are, especially those seasoned agents,
[00:22:30] they're so busy, they need help, right?
[00:22:33] And I was not afraid.
[00:22:34] So I did research on open houses.
[00:22:37] I also took a Cold War banker course
[00:22:40] on successful open houses, how to do them,
[00:22:44] the safety protocols, safety is so important.
[00:22:47] You know, a checklist, I even added my own little things.
[00:22:51] So I made sure that everything that I brought
[00:22:55] had my, my name, my contact information.
[00:22:59] So I would make like these little sheets that I would put
[00:23:02] and I would stick onto the water bottles,
[00:23:05] I'm marketing and lucky for me, the agents would tell me,
[00:23:09] look, this is your open house.
[00:23:11] So you do whatever you, this is yours.
[00:23:13] You take all your leads, you, so I made sure that I do that.
[00:23:16] I wouldn't give people the option to sign in.
[00:23:19] I would say, let me sign you in.
[00:23:22] And if they would say, you know, oh no,
[00:23:24] well, this is a requirement of my entire,
[00:23:27] and for everybody's safety.
[00:23:28] And I would not let them sign in.
[00:23:30] I would do it for them.
[00:23:32] So at least tell me no, right?
[00:23:34] So let me have your name, your phone number, email address,
[00:23:37] are you working with an agent?
[00:23:39] Most of the times they are, most of the times they'll say no.
[00:23:43] So when they're not, I would make sure
[00:23:45] that I would really follow up with those particular people.
[00:23:49] But they all went into my CRM.
[00:23:52] And so I would follow up, I would send them newsletters,
[00:23:56] even if they have an agent.
[00:23:58] So let's, I'm gonna, I want to,
[00:24:01] you just said a lot and all of it was great.
[00:24:03] I want to slow it down a little bit
[00:24:04] and kind of go step by step because this is,
[00:24:07] this is really wonderful information for our listeners.
[00:24:11] So you, yes, you, you had the logo giveaways,
[00:24:15] you when, when people walk in,
[00:24:18] the way that you get them to sign in is you say,
[00:24:20] hey, let me sign you in.
[00:24:22] This is it.
[00:24:22] And if they say, well, you just go, oh, it's a compliance.
[00:24:25] It's a safety measure for us, you know, as agents,
[00:24:29] I'm just need your name, email, phone number, whatever.
[00:24:32] And yes, that's a, that's a really, really smart way
[00:24:35] just to not ever have any knows
[00:24:36] because who's gonna disagree with safety, right?
[00:24:39] So I love that.
[00:24:41] And you, how did you promote the open house?
[00:24:46] No, good.
[00:24:47] Well, if I had about a week or two,
[00:24:51] then that gave me a chance to create my own flyers,
[00:24:55] put it all together with my information,
[00:24:58] post it all over social media, do some door knocking,
[00:25:01] kind of post them in the library in that area.
[00:25:05] So kind of like scouting the neighborhood
[00:25:06] and the signs, talking to people.
[00:25:08] But I will tell you that for me,
[00:25:10] that was very rarely the case.
[00:25:13] Most agents would reach out to three days prior.
[00:25:16] So now I'm like rushing, trying to put things together,
[00:25:20] but as I went along, I learned, okay, Erica,
[00:25:23] make sure you print several of these
[00:25:25] so that if you get an agent that contacts,
[00:25:28] you have everything ready, you have your checklist,
[00:25:30] you have this.
[00:25:31] I made like a little, in my truck,
[00:25:35] I carry like this little box with all of my open house information,
[00:25:39] like things that I would need, snacks and tape,
[00:25:43] like everything you need.
[00:25:44] I have a whole checklist that I use
[00:25:47] to make sure that I even booties.
[00:25:50] I make sure that there's always booties,
[00:25:51] I make sure I have the sign-in information,
[00:25:54] the fly, different flyers, I guess, I business cards.
[00:25:58] Just cute things that you can place,
[00:26:01] and of course I go and purchase snacks for people,
[00:26:05] something that they can just grab and go.
[00:26:08] And then like I said, a flyer with my information on it.
[00:26:11] So person goes through the property,
[00:26:15] either they're asking questions
[00:26:17] or they leave, you already have their information,
[00:26:20] they're walking away with a flyer or whatever.
[00:26:23] Then how quickly do you reach back out to them?
[00:26:26] I reach out to them the next day.
[00:26:28] Okay, so hey, it was nice meeting you.
[00:26:30] Like email, phone call, how do you do it?
[00:26:32] Text? How do you do it?
[00:26:32] I do a text message.
[00:26:34] I start with text messages and I thank them
[00:26:37] for joining or for coming to our open house
[00:26:40] and if they have any interest, please let me know.
[00:26:43] I'd be more than willing to help you
[00:26:44] give you more information.
[00:26:46] And then I'd say, if you don't mind,
[00:26:48] I would like to put you into my newsletter.
[00:26:50] It gives you great homeowner tips, buy guides.
[00:26:54] And I really ever get a no.
[00:26:56] So for me, it's contacting them right away
[00:26:59] and kind of determining, okay, is this person
[00:27:01] like a green, okay, they're motivated?
[00:27:04] You have a REALTOR, do they not?
[00:27:07] And then Bill's there like, well, I'm just looking.
[00:27:09] Yeah, a lot of times you get people who are just wanting
[00:27:12] to look around, just, oh, there's open houses.
[00:27:13] Let me, I'm just curious.
[00:27:15] So I'm going to get a feel for them
[00:27:17] while I'm showing them the house as well.
[00:27:19] Right.
[00:27:20] Well, I also try to have a quick question.
[00:27:24] Hold on, quick question.
[00:27:25] So while you're taking their temperature
[00:27:27] as you're walking them around the property,
[00:27:30] do you make a little note of it somewhere?
[00:27:32] So you remember because I know for me, I would forget
[00:27:34] if, I mean, if only one person came through
[00:27:37] then you won't forget.
[00:27:37] But if 20 people come through, I'm going to be like,
[00:27:39] who's what? Do you take notes?
[00:27:41] Like how do you do it?
[00:27:42] So I have a clipboard, a cute little clipboard
[00:27:44] with the sign in.
[00:27:46] And then I have a comment section that I write notes.
[00:27:49] Like it was a couple that they're
[00:27:52] behind the second home or they're trying to upgrade
[00:27:54] or down, you know, downsize.
[00:27:57] So I do have a note section and I write it down
[00:27:59] because yeah, sometimes you get so many,
[00:28:02] you forget who they are.
[00:28:04] And so I definitely keep notes.
[00:28:06] Yes.
[00:28:06] And you can even reference that in your text
[00:28:09] if you wanted to.
[00:28:10] If you don't want to make too long of a text,
[00:28:12] obviously the next day.
[00:28:14] But you could say, hey, thanks for coming through.
[00:28:17] Really excited that you're looking at your second home
[00:28:19] or whatever.
[00:28:21] Looking, this is exciting that you're
[00:28:23] moving from the city to the suburbs or whatever.
[00:28:26] It's always great when people, I always
[00:28:29] love when sales people reference that
[00:28:31] and their follow-ups, something that they, you know,
[00:28:33] like I get pitched for a lot of technology companies
[00:28:36] for real estate.
[00:28:37] So I love it when I have a meeting.
[00:28:39] And then the next day they're like, hey, great conversation.
[00:28:41] Oh, by the way, this thing that you mentioned or, you know,
[00:28:44] is I always find that to be very flattering.
[00:28:46] And it's like, oh, they're listening.
[00:28:48] That's a good thing.
[00:28:49] I actually personalized it.
[00:28:50] I know we can all copy and paste, right?
[00:28:52] I've made this mistake where I've copied and paste
[00:28:55] and forgot to change somebody's name.
[00:28:56] And I'm like, oh, I've done the same thing.
[00:28:58] So that's lesson learned, right?
[00:29:01] So I make sure that I take notes and I personalize it.
[00:29:03] And that's pretty much with all of my clients,
[00:29:06] regardless of, you know, what transactions or where I met,
[00:29:10] I always want to make it personal.
[00:29:12] I always want to personalize it to our conversation.
[00:29:15] I think that makes you stand out.
[00:29:17] And, you know, they don't feel like, oh, they're,
[00:29:19] they're, they're selling to me.
[00:29:20] Nobody wants to be sold to, right?
[00:29:22] So it's that, yes, that's a great point
[00:29:25] that you brought up.
[00:29:26] You brought up.
[00:29:27] No, you're right.
[00:29:28] I mean, there are people that do like to be sold,
[00:29:30] but I think they are the minority of the public.
[00:29:35] Like I certainly do you think it's those
[00:29:37] that are in the sales industry that like to be sold?
[00:29:40] Probably.
[00:29:41] Yes.
[00:29:41] You know, like my boss, he loves to be sold.
[00:29:45] He just, because he's a business owner
[00:29:46] and he just, he loves that whole process.
[00:29:48] Me, I hate it.
[00:29:49] I just go just give me the information.
[00:29:50] I mean, personality types are all just different.
[00:29:53] And I'm like, give me the information.
[00:29:55] I'm a pretty smart guy.
[00:29:55] I'll figure it out on my own.
[00:29:57] Just be there to answer my questions
[00:30:00] and don't try to push me into anything,
[00:30:02] because I don't, I don't like being pushed.
[00:30:04] But some people do.
[00:30:05] Most people don't.
[00:30:06] So yeah, you're before you're doing that.
[00:30:08] And I know we're talking a lot about open houses,
[00:30:10] but only because I don't get to ever get this granular
[00:30:13] with it with somebody because you're so new,
[00:30:15] like this is a major thing for you.
[00:30:17] So, okay, so I think we covered open houses and oh,
[00:30:19] and follow up.
[00:30:20] So you basically are signing somebody a color or a temperature,
[00:30:24] you know, hey, Red Hot, you know, who knows?
[00:30:27] Super cold, whatever.
[00:30:28] And then you put them in your CRM.
[00:30:32] So they're getting your monthly newsletter
[00:30:34] about real estate.
[00:30:36] And then how often are you reaching out on top of that
[00:30:40] just to sort of make sure that they know you're not just,
[00:30:43] you know, somebody on their email list?
[00:30:45] So they're green, I would say.
[00:30:47] I like to touch like maybe one or every two weeks.
[00:30:51] I, you know, depending on what,
[00:30:52] well how fast and looking, if there's an area,
[00:30:55] they're not sure.
[00:30:56] So about one or twice, you know,
[00:31:00] maybe once every two weeks, I guess,
[00:31:02] I would say an average.
[00:31:04] And then those that are still on the fence,
[00:31:06] you know, maybe a yellow, I would say then,
[00:31:09] I met a couple at an open house
[00:31:12] and they were considering selling each of their own homes
[00:31:15] and moving it together and buying one.
[00:31:17] So me, I'm like, oh, that's three transactions,
[00:31:20] all in one, you know.
[00:31:22] So I, they were somewhat on the fence of,
[00:31:25] they were still thinking about it.
[00:31:27] So I put them in the yellow category.
[00:31:28] So what I did is I looked up their, their current homes
[00:31:32] and I sent out CMAs.
[00:31:34] And so I have them signed up for a monthly CMA,
[00:31:40] like a market report.
[00:31:41] And then I noticed that one of the houses,
[00:31:45] they were not getting any exempts or homeowner exempts.
[00:31:49] So in my email, I wrote to, you know, to her,
[00:31:53] and it was great meeting her, but, you know,
[00:31:56] I am here to help not just to sell.
[00:31:58] And I noticed that there was no exempt
[00:32:00] that in she could possibly apply for one.
[00:32:03] So, and that's money to their pocket.
[00:32:05] So you're essentially giving them an opportunity
[00:32:07] to possibly find income or find, you know,
[00:32:12] a bonus sort of, so to speak.
[00:32:13] I had the same issue when I bought my first home
[00:32:16] in Chicago a million years ago.
[00:32:18] I didn't know about the homeowner's exemption
[00:32:20] and I, for years, I never took advantage of it.
[00:32:23] And after like two or three years,
[00:32:25] somebody was like, you know, about this
[00:32:26] and I wasn't in real estate time.
[00:32:27] And I said, no, I was like, I had no idea.
[00:32:30] So like that is incredible.
[00:32:32] How do you, how do you look that up?
[00:32:35] The homeowner's exempt, or that's just a Chicago thing
[00:32:37] I'm thinking, right?
[00:32:38] That's not necessarily a nationwide thing.
[00:32:40] Is it?
[00:32:40] Well, I use, I use remind.
[00:32:43] Remind me.
[00:32:44] I use remind and then, you know, of course, most of it
[00:32:47] will tell you.
[00:32:48] It will tell you right there, you know, who the owner is.
[00:32:50] So I use remind quite a bit to figure out who the owners are.
[00:32:55] Then sometimes remind will give you the contact information
[00:32:59] for who the owner is.
[00:33:00] You have to make sure that they are not on do not call list.
[00:33:04] But many, you can mail all you want, right?
[00:33:07] That's sure.
[00:33:07] You know, you could do that.
[00:33:09] But then I checked like the deed as well,
[00:33:11] just to make sure.
[00:33:12] I've also found that people have made mistakes.
[00:33:16] Things have been filed under, you know, for instance,
[00:33:20] right now I'm working with the prospect.
[00:33:21] I'm hoping I'm able to list their condo.
[00:33:24] And I looked it up and I noticed that someone else's name was on there.
[00:33:29] And so I, you know, I asked him about it.
[00:33:31] And he says, I have no clue who that is.
[00:33:33] There it was.
[00:33:35] Oh my God.
[00:33:36] Someone else owns the property.
[00:33:37] So then I go to the title company, you know,
[00:33:39] Burnett title who's in Cold War banker.
[00:33:41] And I say, hey, do me a favor.
[00:33:43] Like, just confirm, is this a mistake?
[00:33:45] We confirmed that it was a mistake.
[00:33:46] And then it was fixed a year later.
[00:33:48] But for a whole year, it had somebody else's name on there
[00:33:52] as like a deed in a deed.
[00:33:54] And so it's so important that we look up our own properties
[00:33:57] but also provide that value to your clients.
[00:33:59] That's going to tell them that you are ready to work for them,
[00:34:04] that you're serious and that you are an expert.
[00:34:07] You know, here I found this.
[00:34:09] Even if you don't come with me,
[00:34:10] even if you decide maybe you want to list it
[00:34:13] with another agent that you've always worked with.
[00:34:16] But just know that I will go above and beyond.
[00:34:19] And if maybe I can't work for you,
[00:34:21] how about you refer business to me?
[00:34:24] So here's what I'm hearing from Erica,
[00:34:27] just speaking directly to our audience.
[00:34:29] And I hate to make it sound this simple,
[00:34:31] but I think it probably, oh, I'm going to say it's simple,
[00:34:34] but difficult.
[00:34:36] She basically outworks the competition, meaning.
[00:34:39] And I don't mean necessarily more hours,
[00:34:41] although probably more hours that she puts in as well.
[00:34:44] But most importantly, she takes the professionalism
[00:34:47] of the business very, very seriously.
[00:34:49] She wants to really cover all of her bases.
[00:34:52] You're very intentional about how your processes.
[00:34:55] You have a process for open houses.
[00:34:58] You have a process.
[00:34:59] I mean, I want to switch gears just for a moment
[00:35:02] because you went full steam into,
[00:35:04] I need lots of designation process.
[00:35:07] And you knocked them out.
[00:35:09] And I want to mention this to everybody.
[00:35:11] Look, there's a certain amount of marketing
[00:35:16] that is benefit to even if you don't learn anything
[00:35:21] from the designations.
[00:35:22] And of course you will, but even if you didn't,
[00:35:25] and it's all a big, you know, just not that helpful,
[00:35:28] although it will be, but even if it wasn't,
[00:35:31] it still looks really good when you have all of these
[00:35:34] designations after.
[00:35:36] Now nobody knows what they mean
[00:35:37] and nobody knows really, nobody cares.
[00:35:39] But what they do care about is that you're dedicated
[00:35:41] to the craft, you're dedicated to the industry
[00:35:44] and you're taking it seriously.
[00:35:46] And most people don't have seven different designations,
[00:35:49] which I think you have or close to that.
[00:35:51] The only one I would recommend that I didn't see on there
[00:35:54] and I'm sure you're gonna do it anyway
[00:35:55] because you're done all the others,
[00:35:58] certified negotiation expert, I think is a good one.
[00:36:01] And yeah, you're nodding.
[00:36:02] Of course you do that too.
[00:36:04] Yeah, that's cool.
[00:36:05] Yeah, but the point is is this is a way to gain an edge
[00:36:10] as a competition.
[00:36:12] And that's not why Eric is doing it.
[00:36:13] She's doing it because it'll better service her clients.
[00:36:16] That's really the main reason to do it,
[00:36:17] but it's a nice little side benefit to be like,
[00:36:20] oh, by the way, when you're talking to other agents,
[00:36:25] they may, she's not gonna say this,
[00:36:26] but they're not gonna have all of those initials
[00:36:28] after their names.
[00:36:29] So I absolutely really applaud you.
[00:36:32] You're probably the only guess we've had on
[00:36:37] with that many designations.
[00:36:38] And typically when people go down that path,
[00:36:40] they can tend to get caught up in education
[00:36:43] and then not production.
[00:36:45] And you're doing both.
[00:36:46] And that's what's really impressive is you're not like,
[00:36:49] well, I'm just gonna sit in a do online classes
[00:36:51] all day so I get designations.
[00:36:53] You've also closed six deals in, you know,
[00:36:56] in your first six months.
[00:36:58] And even a deal already this year, which is incredible.
[00:37:01] And you're really just following the process.
[00:37:04] You're doing all of the things that every single guest
[00:37:07] I've ever had on here says, this is what you should do.
[00:37:10] And you're actually doing it.
[00:37:11] So I am so excited to hear about your success.
[00:37:15] So let's talk about, so we talked about open houses.
[00:37:19] I wanna also, and we talked about after,
[00:37:22] what I call aftercare, which is just the following up,
[00:37:25] staying in touch.
[00:37:26] You're calling these people or texting
[00:37:28] or emailing them every couple of weeks.
[00:37:30] You're saying, hey, just check it in,
[00:37:31] how's everything going.
[00:37:32] You're providing value to them.
[00:37:34] Let's talk about social media.
[00:37:36] What are you doing on social to, well, what are you doing?
[00:37:39] How do you think about posting content?
[00:37:42] Are you doing mostly videos, images, both?
[00:37:46] Are you talking about yourself?
[00:37:48] Some, you know, some REALTORS are like,
[00:37:49] here's me at the gym this morning at 5 a.m.,
[00:37:52] other others just do, hey, here's this cool house
[00:37:55] I'm, you know, doing an open house for
[00:37:58] or doing a showing at.
[00:37:59] What is the kind of content that you push out there
[00:38:01] and how do you think about it?
[00:38:03] All of it, however, I need, my goal for 2024
[00:38:07] is to get better at being intentional
[00:38:11] with my social media as far as, you know,
[00:38:14] the content that I'm posting.
[00:38:15] Video is one that I am extremely afraid of.
[00:38:19] I don't know why I'm a big public speaker.
[00:38:22] I've done it for a gazillion years,
[00:38:24] but that camera hits and I'm like frozen, right?
[00:38:26] Like, or I feel like, what do I say?
[00:38:29] But I think people want to see you naturally,
[00:38:32] whether you stutter, whether you mess up
[00:38:34] or, you know, whether your hair's this way.
[00:38:35] I think people now, I think that's more acceptable.
[00:38:39] So I never wanted to sit there and edit, you know,
[00:38:43] my videos, I just felt like why?
[00:38:46] So I have to get better at posting videos
[00:38:48] that are educational as far as in rates dropping
[00:38:52] or, you know, program changes
[00:38:55] or what I do on a day to day basis.
[00:38:59] That's one thing I would like to show people is,
[00:39:02] okay, this is what I do from the minute I wake up.
[00:39:03] This is, it sounds boring, but this is what I search
[00:39:07] I'm a less, this is how I organize, you know,
[00:39:11] my whole day of taking a client to, to showing, you know,
[00:39:16] it can be boring, but that is something that I would like
[00:39:19] to show, you know, social media.
[00:39:24] Posting as well, I want to be a little more intentional
[00:39:26] as far as providing value, more value.
[00:39:31] But I will say that what I have posted are pictures
[00:39:35] and of course, of me studying when I was, when I passed.
[00:39:40] And I have a lot of followers that email me
[00:39:43] or send me private messages asking me,
[00:39:46] what advice can you give me for passing this exam, right?
[00:39:50] So I had a little secret that one of my instructors gave us,
[00:39:54] it's a guy that a lot of people don't know
[00:39:57] is out there in its free, every state has it,
[00:40:01] that it basically walks you through,
[00:40:03] hey, this is how your test is going to be structured
[00:40:05] and this is how many questions are going to be her topic.
[00:40:09] This is how many you're going to have.
[00:40:11] Where do you find that, by the way, for anyone
[00:40:13] who might be studying, we can provide a link to that
[00:40:16] in the show notes when we'll publish the episode.
[00:40:18] But do you happen to know off the top of your head?
[00:40:21] I will say that I have gotten, I think, over 20,000 views
[00:40:27] over it and it's been six, seven months.
[00:40:30] Oh, you made a video about it.
[00:40:31] Yeah, yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll link to it.
[00:40:33] There's my video on my TikTok that's there,
[00:40:36] but every, it's a handbook and every state has it.
[00:40:40] It's a candidate, Illinois candidate handbook.
[00:40:43] It would be cool.
[00:40:44] We will link to the TikTok video for sure.
[00:40:47] Yeah, every time.
[00:40:47] Because I've never heard of that.
[00:40:48] So that's amazing.
[00:40:50] Yep, on top of your real estate book and, you know,
[00:40:52] whatever else, that right there is like the Bible
[00:40:56] of real estate to pass.
[00:40:59] So, you know, that video got me a lot of comments
[00:41:02] and a lot of views.
[00:41:04] I think it's 15, 20,000 or more views, I think.
[00:41:07] It's amazing.
[00:41:08] It's amazing.
[00:41:08] So I post things, little things like that.
[00:41:11] I do post when I've done open houses,
[00:41:15] what, what I'm doing.
[00:41:17] I definitely post when I am under contract,
[00:41:21] especially when I close.
[00:41:23] My gifts that I take my clients,
[00:41:25] I would take pictures of my, the attorney,
[00:41:28] and the whole team that was involved in it.
[00:41:31] And I've gotten a lot of, you know, phrases for,
[00:41:34] wow, you just started and you're on fire.
[00:41:37] I had closing back to back to back to back.
[00:41:40] And so, you know, so just sharing your wins
[00:41:44] and even I have to get better at sharing
[00:41:46] some of my struggles too, you know, it's not always easy.
[00:41:50] So, 2024, I do plan on being more intentional
[00:41:54] with what I post.
[00:41:56] Yeah, I think sharing the losses or the struggles
[00:42:00] is something that agents tend to be afraid to do.
[00:42:04] We don't like to, you know, nobody wants to post
[00:42:06] vulnerabilities that are, you know, challenging
[00:42:10] to think things that are hard.
[00:42:11] Of course, everyone's going through hard things
[00:42:13] at all times.
[00:42:14] And I wish people were more courageous
[00:42:19] to want to share that on social media
[00:42:21] because I'm, I don't know about you,
[00:42:23] but I'm tired of seeing all the wins.
[00:42:25] I love seeing the wins, but I know that life is in all wins.
[00:42:29] And so, I think agents that are willing to be vulnerable,
[00:42:32] which again, takes courage and really not necessarily share,
[00:42:36] oh gosh, you know, I'm going through a divorce or something.
[00:42:38] I mean, you'd want to create healthy boundaries
[00:42:40] to make sure, you know, you're not giving information away
[00:42:43] that isn't appropriate.
[00:42:44] But, you know, if you're having a bad day,
[00:42:46] if you're struggling, if a deal falls through, you know,
[00:42:48] people want to want to hear about how you handle
[00:42:50] not you, Erica, but just I speak into the audience.
[00:42:53] People love to hear about how people move through struggle
[00:42:57] because we all struggle.
[00:42:59] And so I encourage everyone who is only posting, you know,
[00:43:03] here's me lifting my max at the gym in the morning,
[00:43:05] show a time where maybe you didn't have it
[00:43:08] and you couldn't get to the gym that morning.
[00:43:09] And you stayed in bed and, you know,
[00:43:11] and you ate bad food all morning and, you know,
[00:43:13] or whatever, you did something that wasn't perfect.
[00:43:16] And I think talking about imperfection
[00:43:18] is the most relatable thing on the planet.
[00:43:21] But you talked about being afraid of video.
[00:43:23] That is, which you would never know that
[00:43:25] if you're either watching our episode or listening
[00:43:28] because of course, Erica is seemingly super comfortable
[00:43:31] in front of the camera, super confident,
[00:43:33] very elegant and eloquent.
[00:43:36] But she is telling you something vulnerable.
[00:43:38] It's hard for her to get in front and film video.
[00:43:41] So I would recommend we have Kim Rippurg is our video expert
[00:43:45] for our channel here for keeping it real.
[00:43:49] Kim Rippurg literally all she teaches people
[00:43:51] is how to do great video, how to get comfortable.
[00:43:54] So little shout out to Kim Rippurg.
[00:43:56] We'll have a link to her stuff as well
[00:43:58] because we're the biggest Kim fan.
[00:44:00] She's out of New York and she's the queen of that.
[00:44:02] She comes from the media background
[00:44:04] and knows how to do video.
[00:44:06] So she is a great, great guide for you.
[00:44:09] So definitely check her out.
[00:44:10] But yes, let's, I want to finish up with challenges.
[00:44:14] So what is hard for you right now?
[00:44:16] And I don't mean necessarily in your personal life,
[00:44:18] although you could share that if you want to.
[00:44:20] But I'm mostly interested in your professional life
[00:44:23] where we heard about all these successes.
[00:44:26] Where is the struggle right now?
[00:44:27] What is hard for you right now?
[00:44:29] Well, what is hard for me right now?
[00:44:32] I will say being a new agent, it's not having
[00:44:36] a ton of experience, like not having sold or closed on
[00:44:41] 20, 40, 50, 60 deals, you know, like some agents have.
[00:44:46] And with each deal, each transaction,
[00:44:49] I learned something new.
[00:44:51] Wow, whether something that I helped with
[00:44:53] or something I might have already known or a mistake.
[00:44:57] So I would say we learn from our mistakes, right?
[00:45:00] So you take that along.
[00:45:02] I'm very hard on myself when it comes to making mistakes.
[00:45:06] I am a perfectionist.
[00:45:08] And so I always want to make sure that I have the information
[00:45:11] that I know what I'm speaking about.
[00:45:13] But when I do make a mistake or when there's something
[00:45:17] that I don't know, I'm not afraid to say or apologize.
[00:45:20] You know, I'm sorry, I didn't know that.
[00:45:22] But going forward, that always stays in my head.
[00:45:25] Like I will never make that mistake ever again.
[00:45:28] An example I'll give you is I also work with investors,
[00:45:32] my current clients that I'm working with,
[00:45:34] they're in the pipeline right now.
[00:45:36] They're new investors.
[00:45:37] And so for one of them, she wanted to buy a multi-unit
[00:45:40] property.
[00:45:42] So we went to go see one.
[00:45:43] And it was a very unique property, very nice.
[00:45:47] It was like four townhouses together in one building.
[00:45:50] And I remember the REALTOR saying to us,
[00:45:53] well, I can only show you two of those units
[00:45:55] because the tenants didn't allow us to go into the other two
[00:45:58] units, even though we gave them 48 hour notice.
[00:46:02] All right.
[00:46:02] So my client fell in love with it.
[00:46:04] And they said, all those other two units
[00:46:06] are practically the same.
[00:46:08] So we went with that.
[00:46:10] Day of the inspection, we were finding
[00:46:11] we're going to get into those two units.
[00:46:14] Turns out.
[00:46:15] And then, yes, it turns out that first off,
[00:46:19] those two units look nothing like the other two units.
[00:46:22] And there was water damage from both, you know,
[00:46:25] ceilings, meaning there's roof damage, right?
[00:46:27] So the inspector starts doing his thing.
[00:46:30] And he's like, well, I would think twice about this.
[00:46:34] And I said, you know what, yes.
[00:46:35] And learning that going forward with her and me and my client,
[00:46:39] we agreed we're not going to be placing any offers
[00:46:43] until we get to see all the units available.
[00:46:46] We're not going to this again.
[00:46:48] And I don't want to put my client in a situation
[00:46:51] where she's consistently paying for inspections
[00:46:53] and then for a mistake like that, right?
[00:46:56] So it's something I learned along the way
[00:46:58] and I take bits and pieces of what I learned in experiences
[00:47:02] throughout and I just get better.
[00:47:06] It's just getting better and better.
[00:47:08] 
[00:47:08] Well, I love that, you know, I think really what I'm hearing
[00:47:11] is embrace is uncomfortable as it is,
[00:47:15] embrace mistakes and embrace imperfection
[00:47:18] because it is, as you said, it is the effect
[00:47:20] is the only way we actually learn, believe it or not.
[00:47:23] So we don't learn when the stove is cold and we touch it.
[00:47:26] We learn when the stove is hot and we touch it.
[00:47:28] And hopefully we only have to learn that once.
[00:47:31] What we have to do as a REALTOR,
[00:47:33] even those who are very well seasoned,
[00:47:35] they still don't know everything.
[00:47:37] They still learn something with a loss, change so much.
[00:47:41] So that's why I'm so passionate about education
[00:47:43] and staying up to date with these laws,
[00:47:46] especially with Chicago and then the suburbs,
[00:47:49] all these little suburbs and Chicago has their own laws,
[00:47:53] you know, regulations, the city Illinois does as well.
[00:47:57] And you got to make sure you understand the contracts
[00:47:59] between Chicago and Illinois,
[00:48:00] which one goes with what?
[00:48:02] There's just so much.
[00:48:04] I've also made sure I'm bilingual,
[00:48:06] so that is also something that sets me apart.
[00:48:09] I want to say 98% of my clientele are Latinos.
[00:48:14] And I want to say maybe like 80% are Spanish-speaking.
[00:48:19] So I made sure that the team I built,
[00:48:21] and when I say team, I mean vendors,
[00:48:23] all were Spanish-speaking, right?
[00:48:25] Because as a loan officer, you need to be able to do your job.
[00:48:28] I can't do mine in your together as just impossible.
[00:48:31] And it's not my expertise.
[00:48:33] Same thing with the inspector and same thing with the attorneys.
[00:48:36] So I'm always looking for good vendors
[00:48:39] that can provide that service to my clients.
[00:48:43] And also my husband, he is a huge support.
[00:48:47] He's an electrical city inspector.
[00:48:50] Oh.
[00:48:51] Very knowledgeable.
[00:48:52] And so whenever I run into a situation,
[00:48:55] I face time him like, why does this look like this?
[00:48:59] Or what is this?
[00:49:00] And he's like, it has to be certain amps.
[00:49:02] I mean, he's so much help and so much support.
[00:49:04] I'm so grateful that I have someone,
[00:49:07] that can support me that way.
[00:49:09] And on top of that, I know you mentioned
[00:49:12] building like vendor list in one of your podcasts episodes.
[00:49:17] And that's so important because he knows the trade.
[00:49:22] He has a lot of friends in different trades, right?
[00:49:24] So he's an electrical guy.
[00:49:25] He has a plumber.
[00:49:27] He has a friend who also has his own electrical company.
[00:49:29] He has a tile guy, a flooring guy.
[00:49:32] So I am always able to refer them to my clients,
[00:49:36] which is good.
[00:49:38] But I'm also very tough and very particular
[00:49:41] on who gets to be on my vendor list.
[00:49:44] You should be.
[00:49:45] You should be because.
[00:49:46] Exactly.
[00:49:48] Yeah, well, you should be because you,
[00:49:50] they're your reputation.
[00:49:52] So if you send somebody,
[00:49:53] so yeah, so let's,
[00:49:54] you know, it's really a great lesson
[00:49:57] to make sure our vendors are doing good job.
[00:50:00] And what I recommend is once,
[00:50:02] when you refer, not you,
[00:50:04] Eric, of course, just as a general advice to our listeners,
[00:50:07] when you do refer an agent to,
[00:50:11] or sorry, a client to a particular vendor,
[00:50:13] what I would say is,
[00:50:14] hey, I'm referring you to so and so, they're amazing.
[00:50:17] If for some reason you don't have a good experience with them
[00:50:20] or if they don't get back to you,
[00:50:21] or something happens where you're not happy with it,
[00:50:24] please call me immediately.
[00:50:25] I have other people,
[00:50:27] and there's nothing wrong with saying that.
[00:50:29] And I think that really sets it up so that,
[00:50:32] because they might feel like,
[00:50:33] well, I don't want to tell Erica,
[00:50:34] the person was no good,
[00:50:35] because she really loved them.
[00:50:37] And I always like to set it up.
[00:50:38] So it allows for somebody to say,
[00:50:40] you know, I didn't really have a good experience,
[00:50:42] or they didn't get back to me in three days or whatever.
[00:50:45] So anyway, I think.
[00:50:46] I was in the follow up because a lot of times,
[00:50:49] they don't want to tell you, right?
[00:50:51] And for me, I need to know,
[00:50:53] because it's my reputation like you said,
[00:50:54] and I have to also let them know.
[00:50:57] It's a courtesy like, hey, just FYI,
[00:50:59] this is what my client said.
[00:51:01] And you know, okay, is that what happened?
[00:51:02] Or can you explain the situation?
[00:51:05] So that way they also have the opportunity to fix
[00:51:08] the issue or whatever that kind was unsatisfied for,
[00:51:12] or with, but I think having a good list of your vendors
[00:51:17] experienced as well,
[00:51:18] that makes a world of different,
[00:51:19] especially the lender and the attorney.
[00:51:22] Well, this is a perfect place to wrap up the episode.
[00:51:25] There's been so much value you've provided, Erica.
[00:51:28] I really can't thank you enough for not only being a listener
[00:51:32] of ours while you were building your business
[00:51:34] and still continue to be a listener
[00:51:35] as you're building your business.
[00:51:37] I really thank you as just a podcast host for our listeners.
[00:51:41] And I also want to thank all of our listeners
[00:51:42] for paying attention and listening to this episode.
[00:51:45] Being a supporter of our show means a lot to me.
[00:51:48] And if you are somebody that's like,
[00:51:50] I'd like to be on the show someday,
[00:51:52] Erica had that dream and here she is.
[00:51:55] And it's funny because I didn't know that
[00:51:57] and I was asking Erica just when she came on.
[00:52:00] I go, did we find you or did you find us?
[00:52:02] Cause I don't really do too much with the casting.
[00:52:05] And then she said, oh, yeah, no, I know about you.
[00:52:08] But the idea is that, you know,
[00:52:11] you can also be on the show over time.
[00:52:13] And Erica is somebody that you're gonna wanna watch.
[00:52:15] She's going to be rookie of the year this year.
[00:52:17] She is already crushing it.
[00:52:19] She's taking this job extremely seriously.
[00:52:22] And for anyone who's a little bit sad or depressed
[00:52:25] because of the condition of the market, yeah.
[00:52:27] A lot of people are, that's okay.
[00:52:29] But if you surround yourself with content from people
[00:52:32] who are just pushing through and doing the work,
[00:52:35] Erica doesn't know that this is a hard market
[00:52:37] cause it's the only market she's known.
[00:52:38] So to her, this is just what she's doing.
[00:52:40] So if you're a little bummed out
[00:52:42] because things are harder now, yes, I get it.
[00:52:44] I'm with you.
[00:52:45] We have 800 agents here.
[00:52:46] They're depressed too.
[00:52:48] Everyone's dealing with this.
[00:52:49] But if you can connect yourself with accounts like Erica's
[00:52:53] who's consistently just pushing forward,
[00:52:55] it's easier to be motivated to continue to do the same.
[00:52:58] So please, everybody follow her
[00:52:59] on the various social channels, Instagram, Facebook
[00:53:02] and TikTok.
[00:53:04] You can find her,
[00:53:05] eric, oh, sorry, REALTOR.erica.compos.
[00:53:08] And then LinkedIn, of course, just look for her name.
[00:53:10] We will have links to all this in the show notes.
[00:53:12] And if anyone out there is needs a REALTOR in Chicago,
[00:53:17] maybe you have a client moving,
[00:53:19] perhaps their Spanish speaking
[00:53:22] and they need someone to work with,
[00:53:24] Erica would love the opportunity to connect
[00:53:26] with agents from all over the country.
[00:53:27] And by the way, Chicago people don't,
[00:53:30] when they retire, a lot of times they move.
[00:53:31] They move somewhere warmer.
[00:53:33] So Erica's got people that at some point,
[00:53:35] she's gonna need to push out.
[00:53:36] And although I, Erica might just get licensed
[00:53:38] in every state,
[00:53:39] could do it now.
[00:53:40] I was just, I'm just,
[00:53:42] I'm just seriously she takes the business.
[00:53:43] But no, of course she's gonna refer business out.
[00:53:45] So if you wanna connect with her,
[00:53:47] what's the best way Erica that an agent or maybe even a client
[00:53:51] could reach out to you?
[00:53:52] You know, my social media platforms,
[00:53:55] they can reach out to me there.
[00:53:57] They can also reach out to me directly,
[00:54:00] 630-2915-971.
[00:54:03] Or they can email me at erica.compos at C.B.,
[00:54:08] which is C.A.S. and Charlie, B.S. and Boy,
[00:54:11] cbrealty.com.
[00:54:13] Link to those in the show notes as well.
[00:54:15] Stay in touch with Erica.
[00:54:16] She's got amazing energy.
[00:54:18] She takes the job seriously.
[00:54:19] And maybe,
[00:54:20] I mean, I'm gonna follow her
[00:54:21] because I need to be motivated sometimes too.
[00:54:24] And her energy is not only infectious,
[00:54:26] but she's just one of those rising stars
[00:54:29] that we can all learn from,
[00:54:31] even if we're 20 plus years in the business,
[00:54:33] because she is really doing it.
[00:54:35] Erica, thank you so much for being the newest REALTOR
[00:54:38] to ever be on our show.
[00:54:40] One of the first agents of the year to be on our show as well.
[00:54:43] And also, congratulations on doing a deal already this year
[00:54:46] in your first five days.
[00:54:47] That is incredible.
[00:54:49] Please check out Erica,
[00:54:50] follow her all over social media.

[00:54:57] Also, on behalf of Erica,
[00:54:59] and I thank you, the audience.
[00:55:00] Thanks for, gosh, I think we had,
[00:55:03] this was our sixth or seventh year.
[00:55:05] I don't know, six years maybe.
[00:55:06] Of doing the show, we have 500 plus,

[00:55:14] Please tell everybody who you know,
[00:55:16] especially new agents,
[00:55:17] they need to hear somebody having success.
[00:55:19] And Erica is doing that.
[00:55:21] And it's not just falling in her lap.
[00:55:22] She's literally making all of this happen herself.
[00:55:25] So send this episode to another agent
[00:55:27] who's maybe starting out or one who's just struggling right now.
[00:55:30] And most agents are struggling.
[00:55:31] So this is a great opportunity to tell other friends

And now, onto our show. Hello, and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide. I'm your host through the show. And in just a moment, we're going to be speaking with new top producer, Erica Compos. And by the way, if you're new to the show, welcome, we're glad you're here. If you're returning, thank you for coming back. Also, as always, please tell a friend about the show let other agents know about us. I just got back from a market outlook here in Chicago where we had the National Association of REALTORS, Chief Economist, Dr. Lawrence Yoon, speaking on his predictions for 2024. Perhaps I'll do an episode on that myself. But it's gonna be a tricky year. So not as tricky as last year, hopefully, and he was actually fairly optimistic, but we're still gonna see relatively high rates this year, maybe dipping down into the lower sixes by the end of the year was his prediction. But regardless, this is gonna be a tricky year, just is. So let's help each other tell other agents about our show. Let us know if there's agents in your market where you're just like, I wonder how that person's doing it. Somebody who's really crushing it will reach out to them or they can reach out to us. But we wanna always continue to help our audience. We have the record number of listeners right now. So thank you for being here. Thank you for telling a friend. And let's just get to it, the main event. My conversation with Eric Acampus. All right, today my guest on the show is Erica Campos with Cold Well Banker in Chicago. Let me tell you more about Erica. And this is actually a really sort of unique episode for us. I'll tell you why in just a moment. But with over two decades of experience in insurance, finance, sales and customer service, Eric Acampus brings a wealth of knowledge and unique expertise to the table. She's a full-time REALTOR, member of National Association of course, Chicago Association and the resident real estate council. She's affiliated with Cold Well Banker in Oakland, Illinois. She services Chicago and the suburbs. Now, Erica's at 40 years old, Erica decided just recently to take her own leap of faith and dive headfirst into the world of real estate, leaving her nine to five behind as a financial literary coach. She joined Cold Well Banker with a fire in her eyes and a relentless dedication to succeed. I should mention that Erica just started practicing in the last, Erica was it last eight months, I believe? Yeah, about that like six, seven months. It was back in June. Six months, sorry. I was giving you more experience than you have. So six months. Yes, six months in change. I want to tell you more about Erica. I really shouldn't have asked her a question just yet, but I did, but I want you guys to hear this because this is really cool. Within her first six months, which she just just cleared six months, Erica closed an impressive four transactions as most of us remember our first six months. We probably didn't close four transactions. So congratulations to her, but this really proved her quick grasp of the real estate market and her ability to connect with clients. She didn't wait for the new year to even start making waves. Already this year, she closed a deal. By the way, the date that we're recording this is January 5th. So she already has a deal on the books a closed for 2024, congrats to her. But also, I want to also mention this because I think this oftentimes gets overlooked and forgotten about by REALTORS the longer they're in the business. So Erica's really dedicated herself to education in that first six months. So this are some of the accreditations that she has earned just within the last year. So she already is a pricing strategy advisor. She is also a property management trainer. She's gone through property management training, community investment corporation. She's real estate investing, working with investors. She is a financial literary coach, as we mentioned before, and she's a lead renovation, repair, and paint sort of expert. So she is doing a lot of different things and we're going to talk about why she's adding all of these designations and how they're helping her with her clients. But I want everyone to follow her on the various social channels, Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn. You can find her, well, LinkedIn, you just search for Erica Compos. But for all the others, she is REALTOR.erica.campos. And you can find her, we will have links to all of Erica's social media in the show notes. Erica, long intro, but welcome to the show. Thanks, CJ. Thank you. Thank you for having me. I am super excited that I got a chance to be on. I've been a fan of your channel for such a long time. Even before I decided to even enroll in real estate school, I would listen to your podcast. And it has been a true motivation for me to get my license, finally do it. Really? Well, yes. And while I was studying, I'd listen just to get everyone's perspective and what is going on in the real estate world. And again, it was just very motivational and inspirational and it's part of the motivation. That's a why I decided just go for it. Well, that, I am, boy, you've, you've, I am very surprised. I did not know any of this. So wow, that was, that was a lot to take. And thank you. It was, it's a real, it's a real honor to hear that. So thank you so much for sharing that. I was not expecting that. And we should also mention too that you are the, boy, you're really threw me off my game with that one. That one, that one hit, that one hit me pretty hard. Congratulations. Well, I'm really proud of you as well because, you know, people don't usually have this kind of success in their first six months. And it wasn't handed to you. These are things you all earned. So I am, but I'm glad to hear that maybe I was a small part of that over the journey. And what I really want to talk about, I want to start with why the switch to real estate first. So you had this sort of, you know, traditional corporate life before. Why the switch? Well, it all started when I was 17 years old. I, I've been in, I was a insurance agent for a local state farm, you know, agent all state. And then eventually I went to work for brokerages, bigger companies, but I fell in love with the industry back then. I was 17 years old, started part time still finishing high school. And once I turned 18, I, you know, I became licensed for both property casualty life and health, passed them all the first time, same as my real estate license, which I know is a very difficult test. So, you know, again, I fell in love with the industry. I was always in contact with REALTORS and with loan officers and lenders. And I, I think it also comes naturally to me to understand this industry. You know, and I would always be on the phone with loan officers and processors and ask them, well, what's the, what's the interest rate now? What's going, what kind of conventional and FHA programs are happening? And so throughout my career, I, I learned a lot about risk management. So I would go out and inspect the property to make sure it would go through our underwriting, make sure that the house is not falling down, that what we are ensuring, right? So, you know, good structure for both the insurance company and foreign clients. And I think that goes a long way now as well with when I, I'm looking at houses with my clients, I'm able to detect you're going to need a roof in the next two years. You're going to need this furnace. It's a goner. You know, so I think my clients definitely, you know, love that about my experience. And then along the way, of course, you have to be a good salesperson because that was also hourly plus commission. And then you have to provide great customer service because you want to build that trust and you want them to continue coming to you as the expert. So I did that for about 17, 18 years. And in the midst of all that, I also was an educator. So I was building a little side business. Basically, I could say it was life skills, like a life skills educator teaching life skills and financial literacy since back then. And so I have a big education background too. I started teaching all over Chicago and high schools as well, financial literacy and life skills education. And I think all together with my experience and being so detailed and analytical and the plus education piece, I feel again that it's helped me transition into what I am now. And my last job, I was a financial literacy coach and I taught all over underserved communities and young adults, reentry folks. And that pretty much led me into real estate again. So I think it was just a lead way into that. And once I got licensed and I started doing open houses and I started getting clients right off the bat, I realized, okay, I don't know if I can juggle these two. And I don't like working for other people. I like to work for myself. And so I told my husband, listen, I really would love to focus on real estate. I know that I can hit the ground running, give me six months. If in six months, I don't sell one thing. I'll go work for somebody else, I guess. And six months out, you know, four transactions and then the fifth one this month and I have a couple more in the pipeline. So I guess the insurance and financial has always been in my life and I think I missed it for some time and now I'm back into that industry. So it's, I love it. I really love it. Yeah, it's very interesting. I think a lot about previous careers and how they relate. I'm always interested in thinking about, you know, how does somebody take skills from maybe, in this case, you had somewhat related careers but still weren't specifically, you know, super real estate focused, but the idea of customer service and being either a financial literacy coach or an insurance agent, these are all about, these are really service jobs in my mind. I know they're technically considered sales jobs, but I always think, you know, the best agents are the ones that serve the clients most effectively. And I think that does translate really well, customer service. So I imagine that skill that you honed over almost 20 years, probably served you very nicely when you stepped into real estate. Yeah, definitely did. I know that for me, my clients come first. I always go above and beyond for them. If I don't know something, I'm not afraid to say, you know what, let me get back to you. Let me find out. And so then I, then I'll go ask, I'll say someone for my brokerage. Sure. My managing broker, but it's very important to me. It's my reputation, but it's also important that the trust, I don't want to be known for real estate agents. We don't have a good reputation a lot of times, right? Some agents have made that for us, unfortunately. So I make sure that I go above and beyond. And even those clients that I've already closed deals with, I still contact them. I still ask how their house is coming along. I send them, you know, congratulations cards. Christmas cards, holiday cards. For Thanksgiving, I know it was only four, but I personally dropped off pumpkin pies with a thank you note in my business card to each and every one of my clients. So, and potential clients. So you just, you have to go above and beyond. And one of the things that I've listened to in your podcast and that I, I mean, I know myself is that clients can easily forget who their REALTOR was. You know, even who sold them their first house? I'm not going to be that agent. You're going to know who I am. And so even if I, I don't want to come across at the pain in the butt, right? But, you know, again, the holidays, birthdays. So I make sure I collect good information so that I can, you know, continue to communicate with them in more than just a business way. Like a person. Yeah, you just gave an idea just sprung forth from what you just said. So I want to share it with our audience, but I really going to credit Erica with this because it was her words that brought this up in my mind. That I was thinking about when somebody moves in, especially when, you know, somebody's buying a property. And whether it's their first property or not, I don't think it matters for this idea. But the idea that you were saying about how you're staying in touch after the sales, they don't forget about you. It's critical. Obviously we all know that. But sometimes it can be tricky to think about why to call somebody. And so I was just an idea that popped up as you were talking was that pretty much in every home, there's always an unfinished project of sorts, right? There's some sort of, you know, whether it's there, you have to redo a room or you want to do a bigger sort of thing or just cleaning out a closet or whatever project. There's, of course, everybody has lists of projects that are unfinished in there wherever they live. And I think too that would be a fun thing for agents to do once you sell them the home is reach out, you know, within that next year and say, hey, how's it going? How's the home as you had said? And then I probably would say, hey, do you have any projects that you're working on for the home? Just curious what you, if you're doing anything or things you want to do because the reason I'm asking is if you need any referrals, if you need, you know, if you're looking for a particular handyman or somebody to help you with this particular project, I've got people to talk to or at least I'll find good people for you. That would be a great reason to reach out and everyone's got a project that they need to do. So you just, you just spurn that within me. So I just wanted to share that. Let's, and I also want to say too, you are the, I believe, the newest agent to ever have been on our show. I should have mentioned that at the beginning because you are only six or, I guess, the year and year and seventh month now. So this is really a fun one for me because all of, really a lot of our listeners, it's not so much whether they're new, but they love, you know, our audience really loves sort of the new person's energy, right? The new REALTOR's energy because, you know, life has not kicked them around enough yet. So there's still a lot of optimism and excitement, but also you've just really hit the ground running. So tell us how you did it. You mentioned open houses. Was that sort of the first thing you did once you, once you, you know, joined Coldwell Banker? Was that a big deal to start getting out there and talking to clients or respective clients? Okay, well, one, I will say that I'm known to break records. So I've opened another record here. And all my other sales career, that I have broken records and have helped companies reach numbers that are impressive. So, you know, now I've broken another record and my goal is to break Coldwell Banker's record as the first, you know, Lewis A.J. to bring in so many at a certain time. I would like to hit Rookie of the Year, which I think I have one more transaction and they give you a year, 18 months to do it and I'm doing it hopefully in seven a month. So I'm hoping that's a record there. But so how did, how did I start? Well, one, I have a very big sphere of influence. I always say that because in one of my prior businesses, I've met thousands of people. And I make sure they followed me all through all the social medias. So I am very consistent as much as I can. And so when I decided to go into real estate and signed up for schooling, that is when I started posting like, okay, I'm studying for my real estate exam. This is what I do. This is, you know, I started giving out advice on how to study. And then when I passed, I took a picture of me celebrating downtown Chicago, you know, with the Chicago hot dog. And so, you know, so I think what helped me too is just announcing it out there, like being consistent about what I'm doing. And believe it or not, people are watching, you know, you do make a difference, you do empower people, you motivate and inspire others. And like I said, you didn't know, you know, how you inspired me. And so this is why I said we don't know it until we put it out there. And so I think that helped me a lot because again, before I even decided what broker I was going to join, I already had people asking me to be their agent, you know. And so, so then for me, I had already been interviewing a couple of companies. And I decided on code will bank a realty and no clause, it just felt right, you know, in terms of community is so important. So I needed and wanted an office environment that I can go into to talk to other agents. I'm very talkative and I love sharing my experiences and learning from others and vice versa. So that's what I needed. That, so I interviewed there. And I really fell in love with their mission and their support for newer agents and their programs. And their, you know, CBU universities, what they call it, or CBU university. Amazing training, you know. So that I believe also helped me hit the ground running. Code will banker is, Code will banker is very well known. And I also wanted to make sure I joined a well known company as well. So yeah, I mean, just, just walking and just inviting my sphere of influence to follow me through this journey, I think has helped me quite a bit in addition to my experience and expertise. Yeah, I think that's right. So you did what everybody is told to do and most people don't do, which is start telling everybody that you're a REALTOR and start conditioning them, which takes time because they were used to seeing you in different capacity. Obviously the finance world and insurance world, but certainly not the real estate world specifically. So you had to educate, I guess this goes back to education, or really you had to start educating not only the people in your life to know that you're a REALTOR, but then you started educating them about real estate. So that's what's really great in social media is such an effective medium to do that with. So, and okay, so you told everybody you know from all your different previous careers, your sphere of influence, your friends, family, of course, previous clients, which is amazing because of course with your background and insurance, boy, that's a lovely group of people to say, oh, by the way, I am doing this other thing too and everyone's got to live somewhere. So I love that. Well, I want to talk about open houses because I feel that whether you had a sphere of influence or not and you did, but a lot of people don't, they move to a new city, they get their license, they're like, well, that doesn't relate to me, I'm not from here, but anybody can do an open house. And so let's talk about how to do it because we have had people write in sometimes and say, well, I know you guys talk a lot about every person you talk to says I should do open houses, but I don't have any listings. I'm a little bit too shy to ask other agents in my office can I please sit at, you know, do an open house for you? How did you do it? I'm curious like, what was the process for you? Well, one, I know that that was one of the lead generation, I wouldn't say, I don't know, like, tactic, I guess, that is easier for newer agents, right? And it doesn't matter if you have listings or not, obviously, especially as a newer agent, you are not. But so I'm not shy. I will ask you and I'm not afraid of rejection. Being an insurance industry and in sales, rejection is nothing anymore. You know, all right, onto the next, right? So for me, I would write an email and introduce myself as a new Cold War banker REALTOR to our existing offices. So we have multiple offices all over Illinois. So I said, hey, I'm bilingual, I have this experience, sales, customer service, you know, I'm professional, and if you need help with your open houses, I would love, you know, I would love to help you. And so I started getting people, agents reaching out, you know, from different parts of the city too. I was really, really. Oh yeah, especially within your office, within your company, you would be surprised. And agents are, especially those seasoned agents, they're so busy, they need help, right? And I was not afraid. So I did research on open houses. I also took a Cold War banker course on successful open houses, how to do them, the safety protocols, safety is so important. You know, a checklist, I even added my own little things. So I made sure that everything that I brought had my, my name, my contact information. So I would make like these little sheets that I would put and I would stick onto the water bottles, I'm marketing and lucky for me, the agents would tell me, look, this is your open house. So you do whatever you, this is yours. You take all your leads, you, so I made sure that I do that. I wouldn't give people the option to sign in. I would say, let me sign you in. And if they would say, you know, oh no, well, this is a requirement of my entire, and for everybody's safety. And I would not let them sign in. I would do it for them. So at least tell me no, right? So let me have your name, your phone number, email address, are you working with an agent? Most of the times they are, most of the times they'll say no. So when they're not, I would make sure that I would really follow up with those particular people. But they all went into my CRM. And so I would follow up, I would send them newsletters, even if they have an agent. So let's, I'm gonna, I want to, you just said a lot and all of it was great. I want to slow it down a little bit and kind of go step by step because this is, this is really wonderful information for our listeners. So you, yes, you, you had the logo giveaways, you when, when people walk in, the way that you get them to sign in is you say, hey, let me sign you in. This is it. And if they say, well, you just go, oh, it's a compliance. It's a safety measure for us, you know, as agents, I'm just need your name, email, phone number, whatever. And yes, that's a, that's a really, really smart way just to not ever have any knows because who's gonna disagree with safety, right? So I love that. And you, how did you promote the open house? No, good. Well, if I had about a week or two, then that gave me a chance to create my own flyers, put it all together with my information, post it all over social media, do some door knocking, kind of post them in the library in that area. So kind of like scouting the neighborhood and the signs, talking to people. But I will tell you that for me, that was very rarely the case. Most agents would reach out to three days prior. So now I'm like rushing, trying to put things together, but as I went along, I learned, okay, Erica, make sure you print several of these so that if you get an agent that contacts, you have everything ready, you have your checklist, you have this. I made like a little, in my truck, I carry like this little box with all of my open house information, like things that I would need, snacks and tape, like everything you need. I have a whole checklist that I use to make sure that I even booties. I make sure that there's always booties, I make sure I have the sign-in information, the fly, different flyers, I guess, I business cards. Just cute things that you can place, and of course I go and purchase snacks for people, something that they can just grab and go. And then like I said, a flyer with my information on it. So person goes through the property, either they're asking questions or they leave, you already have their information, they're walking away with a flyer or whatever. Then how quickly do you reach back out to them? I reach out to them the next day. Okay, so hey, it was nice meeting you. Like email, phone call, how do you do it? Text? How do you do it? I do a text message. I start with text messages and I thank them for joining or for coming to our open house and if they have any interest, please let me know. I'd be more than willing to help you give you more information. And then I'd say, if you don't mind, I would like to put you into my newsletter. It gives you great homeowner tips, buy guides. And I really ever get a no. So for me, it's contacting them right away and kind of determining, okay, is this person like a green, okay, they're motivated? You have a REALTOR, do they not? And then Bill's there like, well, I'm just looking. Yeah, a lot of times you get people who are just wanting to look around, just, oh, there's open houses. Let me, I'm just curious. So I'm going to get a feel for them while I'm showing them the house as well. Right. Well, I also try to have a quick question. Hold on, quick question. So while you're taking their temperature as you're walking them around the property, do you make a little note of it somewhere? So you remember because I know for me, I would forget if, I mean, if only one person came through then you won't forget. But if 20 people come through, I'm going to be like, who's what? Do you take notes? Like how do you do it? So I have a clipboard, a cute little clipboard with the sign in. And then I have a comment section that I write notes. Like it was a couple that they're behind the second home or they're trying to upgrade or down, you know, downsize. So I do have a note section and I write it down because yeah, sometimes you get so many, you forget who they are. And so I definitely keep notes. Yes. And you can even reference that in your text if you wanted to. If you don't want to make too long of a text, obviously the next day. But you could say, hey, thanks for coming through. Really excited that you're looking at your second home or whatever. Looking, this is exciting that you're moving from the city to the suburbs or whatever. It's always great when people, I always love when sales people reference that and their follow-ups, something that they, you know, like I get pitched for a lot of technology companies for real estate. So I love it when I have a meeting. And then the next day they're like, hey, great conversation. Oh, by the way, this thing that you mentioned or, you know, is I always find that to be very flattering. And it's like, oh, they're listening. That's a good thing. I actually personalized it. I know we can all copy and paste, right? I've made this mistake where I've copied and paste and forgot to change somebody's name. And I'm like, oh, I've done the same thing. So that's lesson learned, right? So I make sure that I take notes and I personalize it. And that's pretty much with all of my clients, regardless of, you know, what transactions or where I met, I always want to make it personal. I always want to personalize it to our conversation. I think that makes you stand out. And, you know, they don't feel like, oh, they're, they're, they're selling to me. Nobody wants to be sold to, right? So it's that, yes, that's a great point that you brought up. You brought up. No, you're right. I mean, there are people that do like to be sold, but I think they are the minority of the public. Like I certainly do you think it's those that are in the sales industry that like to be sold? Probably. Yes. You know, like my boss, he loves to be sold. He just, because he's a business owner and he just, he loves that whole process. Me, I hate it. I just go just give me the information. I mean, personality types are all just different. And I'm like, give me the information. I'm a pretty smart guy. I'll figure it out on my own. Just be there to answer my questions and don't try to push me into anything, because I don't, I don't like being pushed. But some people do. Most people don't. So yeah, you're before you're doing that. And I know we're talking a lot about open houses, but only because I don't get to ever get this granular with it with somebody because you're so new, like this is a major thing for you. So, okay, so I think we covered open houses and oh, and follow up. So you basically are signing somebody a color or a temperature, you know, hey, Red Hot, you know, who knows? Super cold, whatever. And then you put them in your CRM. So they're getting your monthly newsletter about real estate. And then how often are you reaching out on top of that just to sort of make sure that they know you're not just, you know, somebody on their email list? So they're green, I would say. I like to touch like maybe one or every two weeks. I, you know, depending on what, well how fast and looking, if there's an area, they're not sure. So about one or twice, you know, maybe once every two weeks, I guess, I would say an average. And then those that are still on the fence, you know, maybe a yellow, I would say then, I met a couple at an open house and they were considering selling each of their own homes and moving it together and buying one. So me, I'm like, oh, that's three transactions, all in one, you know. So I, they were somewhat on the fence of, they were still thinking about it. So I put them in the yellow category. So what I did is I looked up their, their current homes and I sent out CMAs. And so I have them signed up for a monthly CMA, like a market report. And then I noticed that one of the houses, they were not getting any exempts or homeowner exempts. So in my email, I wrote to, you know, to her, and it was great meeting her, but, you know, I am here to help not just to sell. And I noticed that there was no exempt that in she could possibly apply for one. So, and that's money to their pocket. So you're essentially giving them an opportunity to possibly find income or find, you know, a bonus sort of, so to speak. I had the same issue when I bought my first home in Chicago a million years ago. I didn't know about the homeowner's exemption and I, for years, I never took advantage of it. And after like two or three years, somebody was like, you know, about this and I wasn't in real estate time. And I said, no, I was like, I had no idea. So like that is incredible. How do you, how do you look that up? The homeowner's exempt, or that's just a Chicago thing I'm thinking, right? That's not necessarily a nationwide thing. Is it? Well, I use, I use remind. Remind me. I use remind and then, you know, of course, most of it will tell you. It will tell you right there, you know, who the owner is. So I use remind quite a bit to figure out who the owners are. Then sometimes remind will give you the contact information for who the owner is. You have to make sure that they are not on do not call list. But many, you can mail all you want, right? That's sure. You know, you could do that. But then I checked like the deed as well, just to make sure. I've also found that people have made mistakes. Things have been filed under, you know, for instance, right now I'm working with the prospect. I'm hoping I'm able to list their condo. And I looked it up and I noticed that someone else's name was on there. And so I, you know, I asked him about it. And he says, I have no clue who that is. There it was. Oh my God. Someone else owns the property. So then I go to the title company, you know, Burnett title who's in Cold War banker. And I say, hey, do me a favor. Like, just confirm, is this a mistake? We confirmed that it was a mistake. And then it was fixed a year later. But for a whole year, it had somebody else's name on there as like a deed in a deed. And so it's so important that we look up our own properties but also provide that value to your clients. That's going to tell them that you are ready to work for them, that you're serious and that you are an expert. You know, here I found this. Even if you don't come with me, even if you decide maybe you want to list it with another agent that you've always worked with. But just know that I will go above and beyond. And if maybe I can't work for you, how about you refer business to me? So here's what I'm hearing from Erica, just speaking directly to our audience. And I hate to make it sound this simple, but I think it probably, oh, I'm going to say it's simple, but difficult. She basically outworks the competition, meaning. And I don't mean necessarily more hours, although probably more hours that she puts in as well. But most importantly, she takes the professionalism of the business very, very seriously. She wants to really cover all of her bases. You're very intentional about how your processes. You have a process for open houses. You have a process. I mean, I want to switch gears just for a moment because you went full steam into, I need lots of designation process. And you knocked them out. And I want to mention this to everybody. Look, there's a certain amount of marketing that is benefit to even if you don't learn anything from the designations. And of course you will, but even if you didn't, and it's all a big, you know, just not that helpful, although it will be, but even if it wasn't, it still looks really good when you have all of these designations after. Now nobody knows what they mean and nobody knows really, nobody cares. But what they do care about is that you're dedicated to the craft, you're dedicated to the industry and you're taking it seriously. And most people don't have seven different designations, which I think you have or close to that. The only one I would recommend that I didn't see on there and I'm sure you're gonna do it anyway because you're done all the others, certified negotiation expert, I think is a good one. And yeah, you're nodding. Of course you do that too. Yeah, that's cool. Yeah, but the point is is this is a way to gain an edge as a competition. And that's not why Eric is doing it. She's doing it because it'll better service her clients. That's really the main reason to do it, but it's a nice little side benefit to be like, oh, by the way, when you're talking to other agents, they may, she's not gonna say this, but they're not gonna have all of those initials after their names. So I absolutely really applaud you. You're probably the only guess we've had on with that many designations. And typically when people go down that path, they can tend to get caught up in education and then not production. And you're doing both. And that's what's really impressive is you're not like, well, I'm just gonna sit in a do online classes all day so I get designations. You've also closed six deals in, you know, in your first six months. And even a deal already this year, which is incredible. And you're really just following the process. You're doing all of the things that every single guest I've ever had on here says, this is what you should do. And you're actually doing it. So I am so excited to hear about your success. So let's talk about, so we talked about open houses. I wanna also, and we talked about after, what I call aftercare, which is just the following up, staying in touch. You're calling these people or texting or emailing them every couple of weeks. You're saying, hey, just check it in, how's everything going. You're providing value to them. Let's talk about social media. What are you doing on social to, well, what are you doing? How do you think about posting content? Are you doing mostly videos, images, both? Are you talking about yourself? Some, you know, some REALTORS are like, here's me at the gym this morning at 5 a.m., other others just do, hey, here's this cool house I'm, you know, doing an open house for or doing a showing at. What is the kind of content that you push out there and how do you think about it? All of it, however, I need, my goal for 2024 is to get better at being intentional with my social media as far as, you know, the content that I'm posting. Video is one that I am extremely afraid of. I don't know why I'm a big public speaker. I've done it for a gazillion years, but that camera hits and I'm like frozen, right? Like, or I feel like, what do I say? But I think people want to see you naturally, whether you stutter, whether you mess up or, you know, whether your hair's this way. I think people now, I think that's more acceptable. So I never wanted to sit there and edit, you know, my videos, I just felt like why? So I have to get better at posting videos that are educational as far as in rates dropping or, you know, program changes or what I do on a day to day basis. That's one thing I would like to show people is, okay, this is what I do from the minute I wake up. This is, it sounds boring, but this is what I search I'm a less, this is how I organize, you know, my whole day of taking a client to, to showing, you know, it can be boring, but that is something that I would like to show, you know, social media. Posting as well, I want to be a little more intentional as far as providing value, more value. But I will say that what I have posted are pictures and of course, of me studying when I was, when I passed. And I have a lot of followers that email me or send me private messages asking me, what advice can you give me for passing this exam, right? So I had a little secret that one of my instructors gave us, it's a guy that a lot of people don't know is out there in its free, every state has it, that it basically walks you through, hey, this is how your test is going to be structured and this is how many questions are going to be her topic. This is how many you're going to have. Where do you find that, by the way, for anyone who might be studying, we can provide a link to that in the show notes when we'll publish the episode. But do you happen to know off the top of your head? I will say that I have gotten, I think, over 20,000 views over it and it's been six, seven months. Oh, you made a video about it. Yeah, yeah, we'll, we'll, we'll link to it. There's my video on my TikTok that's there, but every, it's a handbook and every state has it. It's a candidate, Illinois candidate handbook. It would be cool. We will link to the TikTok video for sure. Yeah, every time. Because I've never heard of that. So that's amazing. Yep, on top of your real estate book and, you know, whatever else, that right there is like the Bible of real estate to pass. So, you know, that video got me a lot of comments and a lot of views. I think it's 15, 20,000 or more views, I think. It's amazing. It's amazing. So I post things, little things like that. I do post when I've done open houses, what, what I'm doing. I definitely post when I am under contract, especially when I close. My gifts that I take my clients, I would take pictures of my, the attorney, and the whole team that was involved in it. And I've gotten a lot of, you know, phrases for, wow, you just started and you're on fire. I had closing back to back to back to back. And so, you know, so just sharing your wins and even I have to get better at sharing some of my struggles too, you know, it's not always easy. So, 2024, I do plan on being more intentional with what I post. Yeah, I think sharing the losses or the struggles is something that agents tend to be afraid to do. We don't like to, you know, nobody wants to post vulnerabilities that are, you know, challenging to think things that are hard. Of course, everyone's going through hard things at all times. And I wish people were more courageous to want to share that on social media because I'm, I don't know about you, but I'm tired of seeing all the wins. I love seeing the wins, but I know that life is in all wins. And so, I think agents that are willing to be vulnerable, which again, takes courage and really not necessarily share, oh gosh, you know, I'm going through a divorce or something. I mean, you'd want to create healthy boundaries to make sure, you know, you're not giving information away that isn't appropriate. But, you know, if you're having a bad day, if you're struggling, if a deal falls through, you know, people want to want to hear about how you handle not you, Erica, but just I speak into the audience. People love to hear about how people move through struggle because we all struggle. And so I encourage everyone who is only posting, you know, here's me lifting my max at the gym in the morning, show a time where maybe you didn't have it and you couldn't get to the gym that morning. And you stayed in bed and, you know, and you ate bad food all morning and, you know, or whatever, you did something that wasn't perfect. And I think talking about imperfection is the most relatable thing on the planet. But you talked about being afraid of video. That is, which you would never know that if you're either watching our episode or listening because of course, Erica is seemingly super comfortable in front of the camera, super confident, very elegant and eloquent. But she is telling you something vulnerable. It's hard for her to get in front and film video. So I would recommend we have Kim Rippurg is our video expert for our channel here for keeping it real. Kim Rippurg literally all she teaches people is how to do great video, how to get comfortable. So little shout out to Kim Rippurg. We'll have a link to her stuff as well because we're the biggest Kim fan. She's out of New York and she's the queen of that. She comes from the media background and knows how to do video. So she is a great, great guide for you. So definitely check her out. But yes, let's, I want to finish up with challenges. So what is hard for you right now? And I don't mean necessarily in your personal life, although you could share that if you want to. But I'm mostly interested in your professional life where we heard about all these successes. Where is the struggle right now? What is hard for you right now? Well, what is hard for me right now? I will say being a new agent, it's not having a ton of experience, like not having sold or closed on 20, 40, 50, 60 deals, you know, like some agents have. And with each deal, each transaction, I learned something new. Wow, whether something that I helped with or something I might have already known or a mistake. So I would say we learn from our mistakes, right? So you take that along. I'm very hard on myself when it comes to making mistakes. I am a perfectionist. And so I always want to make sure that I have the information that I know what I'm speaking about. But when I do make a mistake or when there's something that I don't know, I'm not afraid to say or apologize. You know, I'm sorry, I didn't know that. But going forward, that always stays in my head. Like I will never make that mistake ever again. An example I'll give you is I also work with investors, my current clients that I'm working with, they're in the pipeline right now. They're new investors. And so for one of them, she wanted to buy a multi-unit property. So we went to go see one. And it was a very unique property, very nice. It was like four townhouses together in one building. And I remember the REALTOR saying to us, well, I can only show you two of those units because the tenants didn't allow us to go into the other two units, even though we gave them 48 hour notice. All right. So my client fell in love with it. And they said, all those other two units are practically the same. So we went with that. Day of the inspection, we were finding we're going to get into those two units. Turns out. And then, yes, it turns out that first off, those two units look nothing like the other two units. And there was water damage from both, you know, ceilings, meaning there's roof damage, right? So the inspector starts doing his thing. And he's like, well, I would think twice about this. And I said, you know what, yes. And learning that going forward with her and me and my client, we agreed we're not going to be placing any offers until we get to see all the units available. We're not going to this again. And I don't want to put my client in a situation where she's consistently paying for inspections and then for a mistake like that, right? So it's something I learned along the way and I take bits and pieces of what I learned in experiences throughout and I just get better. It's just getting better and better. Well, I love that, you know, I think really what I'm hearing is embrace is uncomfortable as it is, embrace mistakes and embrace imperfection because it is, as you said, it is the effect is the only way we actually learn, believe it or not. So we don't learn when the stove is cold and we touch it. We learn when the stove is hot and we touch it. And hopefully we only have to learn that once. What we have to do as a REALTOR, even those who are very well seasoned, they still don't know everything. They still learn something with a loss, change so much. So that's why I'm so passionate about education and staying up to date with these laws, especially with Chicago and then the suburbs, all these little suburbs and Chicago has their own laws, you know, regulations, the city Illinois does as well. And you got to make sure you understand the contracts between Chicago and Illinois, which one goes with what? There's just so much. I've also made sure I'm bilingual, so that is also something that sets me apart. I want to say 98% of my clientele are Latinos. And I want to say maybe like 80% are Spanish-speaking. So I made sure that the team I built, and when I say team, I mean vendors, all were Spanish-speaking, right? Because as a loan officer, you need to be able to do your job. I can't do mine in your together as just impossible. And it's not my expertise. Same thing with the inspector and same thing with the attorneys. So I'm always looking for good vendors that can provide that service to my clients. And also my husband, he is a huge support. He's an electrical city inspector. Oh. Very knowledgeable. And so whenever I run into a situation, I face time him like, why does this look like this? Or what is this? And he's like, it has to be certain amps. I mean, he's so much help and so much support. I'm so grateful that I have someone, that can support me that way. And on top of that, I know you mentioned building like vendor list in one of your podcasts episodes. And that's so important because he knows the trade. He has a lot of friends in different trades, right? So he's an electrical guy. He has a plumber. He has a friend who also has his own electrical company. He has a tile guy, a flooring guy. So I am always able to refer them to my clients, which is good. But I'm also very tough and very particular on who gets to be on my vendor list. You should be. You should be because. Exactly. Yeah, well, you should be because you, they're your reputation. So if you send somebody, so yeah, so let's, you know, it's really a great lesson to make sure our vendors are doing good job. And what I recommend is once, when you refer, not you, Eric, of course, just as a general advice to our listeners, when you do refer an agent to, or sorry, a client to a particular vendor, what I would say is, hey, I'm referring you to so and so, they're amazing. If for some reason you don't have a good experience with them or if they don't get back to you, or something happens where you're not happy with it, please call me immediately. I have other people, and there's nothing wrong with saying that. And I think that really sets it up so that, because they might feel like, well, I don't want to tell Erica, the person was no good, because she really loved them. And I always like to set it up. So it allows for somebody to say, you know, I didn't really have a good experience, or they didn't get back to me in three days or whatever. So anyway, I think. I was in the follow up because a lot of times, they don't want to tell you, right? And for me, I need to know, because it's my reputation like you said, and I have to also let them know. It's a courtesy like, hey, just FYI, this is what my client said. And you know, okay, is that what happened? Or can you explain the situation? So that way they also have the opportunity to fix the issue or whatever that kind was unsatisfied for, or with, but I think having a good list of your vendors experienced as well, that makes a world of different, especially the lender and the attorney. Well, this is a perfect place to wrap up the episode. There's been so much value you've provided, Erica. I really can't thank you enough for not only being a listener of ours while you were building your business and still continue to be a listener as you're building your business. I really thank you as just a podcast host for our listeners. And I also want to thank all of our listeners for paying attention and listening to this episode. Being a supporter of our show means a lot to me. And if you are somebody that's like, I'd like to be on the show someday, Erica had that dream and here she is. And it's funny because I didn't know that and I was asking Erica just when she came on. I go, did we find you or did you find us? Cause I don't really do too much with the casting. And then she said, oh, yeah, no, I know about you. But the idea is that, you know, you can also be on the show over time. And Erica is somebody that you're gonna wanna watch. She's going to be rookie of the year this year. She is already crushing it. She's taking this job extremely seriously. And for anyone who's a little bit sad or depressed because of the condition of the market, yeah. A lot of people are, that's okay. But if you surround yourself with content from people who are just pushing through and doing the work, Erica doesn't know that this is a hard market cause it's the only market she's known. So to her, this is just what she's doing. So if you're a little bummed out because things are harder now, yes, I get it. I'm with you. We have 800 agents here. They're depressed too. Everyone's dealing with this. But if you can connect yourself with accounts like Erica's who's consistently just pushing forward, it's easier to be motivated to continue to do the same. So please, everybody follow her on the various social channels, Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. You can find her, eric, oh, sorry, REALTOR.erica.compos. And then LinkedIn, of course, just look for her name. We will have links to all this in the show notes. And if anyone out there is needs a REALTOR in Chicago, maybe you have a client moving, perhaps their Spanish speaking and they need someone to work with, Erica would love the opportunity to connect with agents from all over the country. And by the way, Chicago people don't, when they retire, a lot of times they move. They move somewhere warmer. So Erica's got people that at some point, she's gonna need to push out. And although I, Erica might just get licensed in every state, could do it now. I was just, I'm just, I'm just seriously she takes the business. But no, of course she's gonna refer business out. So if you wanna connect with her, what's the best way Erica that an agent or maybe even a client could reach out to you? You know, my social media platforms, they can reach out to me there. They can also reach out to me directly, 630-2915-971. Or they can email me at erica.compos at C.B., which is C.A.S. and Charlie, B.S. and Boy, cbrealty.com. Link to those in the show notes as well. Stay in touch with Erica. She's got amazing energy. She takes the job seriously. And maybe, I mean, I'm gonna follow her because I need to be motivated sometimes too. And her energy is not only infectious, but she's just one of those rising stars that we can all learn from, even if we're 20 plus years in the business, because she is really doing it.
