[00:01:29] I'm so happy to be back on Keeping It Real.
[00:01:32] I always have so much fun and please keep following me on social.
[00:01:35] Everyone who's reached out to me, I love engaging with and I love hearing from you.
[00:01:38] I'm Kim Rittberg.
[00:01:40] I help real estate agents grow their leads, income and credibility with video and podcasts.
[00:01:45] And I got here from being a TV news producer for about a decade.
[00:01:48] I launched the digital video unit for us weekly, meaning I turned an office into a live TV studio,
[00:01:53] which is basically what every single business owner has to do today.
[00:01:57] And I worked in video marketing at Netflix and Pop Shugger.
[00:02:00] And so now I take all of that experience to empower and teach real estate agents how they
[00:02:05] can leverage video and podcast to grow their own business.
[00:02:09] It's really, really fun for me.
[00:02:10] I do one-on-one and group coaching.
[00:02:13] And one thing I really want to focus on today is about being camera shy.
[00:02:19] And how you can go from camera shy to camera shine.
[00:02:23] I recently spoke at the Berkshire Hathaway Home Services National Sales Convention in Las Vegas.
[00:02:28] Yes, I flew to Vegas.
[00:02:29] I was like the only person not participating in Sin City in the world.
[00:02:32] I really was there just to speak and meet people.
[00:02:36] Anyway, it was really, really fun.
[00:02:38] There were thousands of agents there.
[00:02:40] I met so many incredible people looking to grow and invest in themselves.
[00:02:44] And one of, I taught two sessions and one of the sessions I want to drop some of the lessons that
[00:02:50] people really responded to here.
[00:02:53] And it's about how to cut through your camera shyness.
[00:02:56] How to go from camera shy to camera shine.
[00:02:58] And I want to start by saying obviously I'm a believer in video.
[00:03:02] But not just because I come from video and TV.
[00:03:05] But rather, there are all of these studies and all of these statistics that show that if you're
[00:03:11] using video, you're getting better conversion rates.
[00:03:15] And like over 85% of buyers and sellers want an agent who's using video.
[00:03:20] 90% of companies are seeing video convert to sales.
[00:03:24] So it's just a better sales tool.
[00:03:27] And when you think about a filtered headshot with three sentences on social media versus
[00:03:33] a video of a real estate agent talking about their neighborhood.
[00:03:37] Why they love it so much.
[00:03:38] Walking their dog, letting you get to know them.
[00:03:41] When you think about those two agents, if you were a buyer, who are you going to work with?
[00:03:44] So I love teaching agents how to really grow with video.
[00:03:47] But one of the things you got to get that bandaid off, you got to rip off that bandaid.
[00:03:51] I personally was camera shy when I started my business when I left corporate.
[00:03:56] But I realized very quickly that you can't be shy because hiding from the camera means hiding
[00:04:02] from clients. So today I'm going to give you a couple of tips on how to get over that fear
[00:04:07] and some tactical ways to get you on camera.
[00:04:11] So number one, I want to say by the way, when you start showing up on camera,
[00:04:14] you will have some early wins. But the truth is it's not like you make one video and suddenly
[00:04:18] a bunch of leads come in. But when you start using video in a consistent and effective and
[00:04:21] strategic way, like you have a plan, you know your messaging, you know who your ideal client is.
[00:04:27] And you understand broadly the things you're talking about.
[00:04:30] And then you're showing up consistently, whether that's twice a month or seven times a month,
[00:04:34] it really will unlock a lot of leads.
[00:04:37] I'm seeing this with my one-on-one real estate clients.
[00:04:39] I'm seeing with my group coaching clients,
[00:04:42] the people who are showing up consistently are having dormant leads, meaning people who
[00:04:48] I hadn't seen in years come back, see their content re-engage with it, and they're connecting to
[00:04:53] new people because if someone is considering you, then they go to your social page, you're in
[00:04:58] their consideration set. They're checking you out on social. They're getting to know you better
[00:05:01] there. So the more you can show up, the more you can be competitive. And the reason why it's so
[00:05:07] important to put yourself on camera is because you are your unique special sauce.
[00:05:13] Basically, if I have one video idea and I give it to a hundred real estate agents,
[00:05:16] I'm going to get a hundred different videos back because you each bring your own unique
[00:05:20] special something. So don't forget that. You know sometimes I think people feel like, oh
[00:05:24] every idea has been out there. But you are what makes it unique. Your perspective, your why,
[00:05:29] why you're an agent, why you love that neighborhood, why you love helping people.
[00:05:33] So I want to start with that. So I'm going to start with being on camera, basically.
[00:05:39] Hiding from the camera means hiding from clients. I was very camera shy when I started my business.
[00:05:44] I've really had all those negative voices in my head that you all have. I feel self-conscious.
[00:05:50] Oh my voice. Oh how do I look? I feel awkward. It's of normal feeling. Everybody feels it.
[00:05:57] I've trained on camera coach CEOs, members of Congress, celebrities, every single person feels
[00:06:03] that way. So you're in great company. And then I basically once you get your mindset, you have
[00:06:10] to really think about getting out of what I call supermodel mode. So get out of supermodel mode,
[00:06:16] stop thinking about how you look and who's looking at you and get into teacher mode.
[00:06:21] Start thinking about who you're teaching, how you're educating them. Basically, if you're showing
[00:06:28] up on camera, it's to speak to your ideal client. It's to tell them what you're about. It's to tell
[00:06:33] them who you are. It's to bring your experience and personality to the forefront. So step one,
[00:06:42] quiet those negative voices. And the best way to quiet those voices is to remember why you're
[00:06:46] putting yourself on camera. Sure, you can keep just doing home tours. You can keep posting photos
[00:06:51] of homes. But the truth is you're going to be more effective as a salesperson if you're putting
[00:06:55] videos out there. And additionally, think about this. How many meetings can you have in person each
[00:06:58] week? With one video, you can reach hundreds or thousands of people while you're out doing your
[00:07:05] business, while you're having lunch with your spouse while you're walking your dog. So just remember
[00:07:10] the power of social media is that it's working in the background. You know, those of you who are
[00:07:14] doing social a lot, you look, you're like, oh, you've even not posting a lot. You're still having
[00:07:19] hundreds or thousands of people see your content. So the time you put in gets exponentially grown.
[00:07:26] Anyway, so I'm going to return back to the concept of camera shy to camera shine.
[00:07:30] I felt that same way. I was self-conscious. The limiting beliefs I had, I'm self-conscious. Who wants
[00:07:35] to hear from me? Am I really an expert? I mean, I do think of an expert. That was one of the beliefs
[00:07:41] I had less, but I know a lot of people feel like, who am I? Why does anyone want to hear my
[00:07:46] perspective? But you have to remember, you're only talking to your ideal client. So you're going to
[00:07:51] ignore any of those negative voices you're hearing in your head. When you're feeling self-conscious,
[00:07:55] you're envisioning Nancy from high school, who was mean to you in the cafeteria or you're envisioning
[00:08:00] John, the colleague who stabbed you in the back. Those people are not following on social. If they are,
[00:08:05] and you feel like they're writing mean things, it's in their own head. It's their negative. It's their
[00:08:11] negativity, but truly, attention is so hard to get. It's so hard to get attention. So probably
[00:08:16] they're not paying attention to you. They're probably thinking about what they're cooking for dinner.
[00:08:21] So don't give them any power. Don't give them any weight. Really talk to your ideal client.
[00:08:27] Identify who you're talking to and make every video for that person. And then the more you do that,
[00:08:33] you'll start realizing that they're responding. They're there. They're there for you.
[00:08:37] So we're going to stop hiding from the clients. Once I personally, once I stopped hiding from the camera,
[00:08:43] I started putting myself on camera and I'm seeing this for all of my clients. I had one video,
[00:08:49] bring me three new clients. I did one video. I immediately got three new clients. I've tripled my
[00:08:55] speaking engagements. I've quadrupled my inbound leads, meaning on LinkedIn, on Instagram,
[00:09:00] I get notifications. I get emails for discovery calls every single week, because I'm not there on
[00:09:06] podcasts, because I'm out there speaking, because I'm out there putting myself on social. But
[00:09:12] it took me a while to get there. So it's not like it just happened overnight.
[00:09:16] And so I want you to get there. I'm seeing that happen to my agent, one of my agents David. He had
[00:09:19] somebody pop into his phone. Hey, loving what you're putting out there, you want to grab lunch.
[00:09:25] Somebody hadn't seen in years. This CEO of his company had messaged him saying he's liking his
[00:09:30] content. So it's both for your clients, but it's also for peers. It's for referrals. You know,
[00:09:36] we're getting out of basically to go from camera shy to camera shine. We're getting out of
[00:09:42] supermodel mode. We're getting into teacher mode. That's the biggest, biggest thing. That's the
[00:09:48] number one mindset thing. I cannot stress it enough. I'm not a huge person who reads books about
[00:09:54] mindset and self-help, but I'm very much in touch with who I am and fighting through the things that
[00:09:59] hold me back. I had a lot of fear to start my own business. I had a lot of fear to put myself out
[00:10:03] there. I'm now speaking on national stages. I'm now contributing to Fast Company magazine.
[00:10:07] I've been written up in business insider. Those things are all happening because I started showing
[00:10:11] up. So I'm such an advocate of bringing yourself out there, putting yourself out there,
[00:10:16] telling yourself you deserve it and you're worth it because it's worth it to push through.
[00:10:20] So you have to get through that mindset. And then after you're getting through that mindset,
[00:10:25] you're repairing your body. So you have to remember that when you're talking,
[00:10:30] the camera is stealing our energy. So the best way to counteract that is to practice being
[00:10:37] authentic on camera. And I realize that's a little ironic, but people are like, just be yourself.
[00:10:41] Don't try to be yourself. Try to be yourself on video. It's a different version of you.
[00:10:47] It's one where you have to practice breathing and get yourself psyched up before you go on camera.
[00:10:52] But remember that we all are a little frozen, a little robotic on camera at first. That's okay.
[00:10:58] Video number one will be worse than video five. We'll be worse than video 10. But once you're
[00:11:03] 10 videos in, 20 videos in, 30 videos in, you're going to be like, oh, okay, I'm showing up more
[00:11:08] as myself, but you have it takes practice. It takes practice just like every other thing. So
[00:11:15] preparing your mindset is you're getting on a supermodel mode. You're getting into teacher mode.
[00:11:19] And you're preparing your body. You are actually preparing and practicing. And the best way to
[00:11:26] practice is by putting yourself on camera. So I'm going to give you a challenge this week.
[00:11:31] I'm going to check in on you. I know a lot of you are following me on social now, which is amazing.
[00:11:34] And I love it. You are going to put yourself on camera. And basically putting yourself on camera
[00:11:41] can be any of these things. The best way to do it is just start talking to your camera in a very
[00:11:46] casual way. You just like, what does your day look like? So for example, I would put my camera up.
[00:11:53] Hold it out as far as I can. Hold it up a little higher than I line. So we're not getting that
[00:11:57] up the nose, up the chin angle. And I'm just going to bring my social followers into my day.
[00:12:04] Hey, everyone. I'm back from Vegas. I'm super jet lag. I'm going to drink a little
[00:12:07] lots of coffee. My kids are on spring break. So I'm going to spend some time with them. And then
[00:12:11] I have a lot of follow up emails from all the great people I met. And a couple of a few calls.
[00:12:17] And then I'm going to take my kids to paint art at a new craft studio in Brooklyn.
[00:12:22] And then I might also, here's a tip, we put that video out on Instagram Stories.
[00:12:29] Basically Instagram Stories disappears after 24 hours. So if you hate the video, don't worry, it's
[00:12:33] gone. But Instagram Stories is a great way to really connect with people and bring them in in a
[00:12:38] more sincere way. It's less filtered. It's not necessarily like a home tour. And it's not
[00:12:44] necessarily even commentary on the market. It's just you bringing people into your day. Obviously,
[00:12:50] you want to tie it a little bit to your job. So as I mentioned in that video, I just shot. I
[00:12:55] mentioned I just went to a speaking engagement. I mentioned I'm a parent because that is a part
[00:12:59] of my life. And other parents really connect with that. So in those videos, you can mention
[00:13:04] things about your life. If you have a pet, if you play basketball, if you love football, if
[00:13:10] you have kids, something that lets people connect with you on a personal level. And then my other
[00:13:15] tip is in Instagram Stories, there are these things called stickers. It's that little smiley
[00:13:20] face square. If you put out a poll like if I wrote, I'm having my coffee, I'm super jet lagged,
[00:13:27] I love coffee. I can't live without my coffee. A poll you could put in there is coffee or tea.
[00:13:34] And people will vote coffee or tea. This is just a way to engage with people, just to say,
[00:13:38] actually, who's watching my stories? And you'll be surprised. Sometimes people will respond to
[00:13:42] the poll and I'm like, oh, I didn't realize that person is following me or engaging with my content.
[00:13:46] That's interesting. Maybe you want to reach out to that person. You should engage with their
[00:13:50] content. So we're bringing that social aspect back into social media. But again, the best way to do
[00:13:56] that is by putting our face in there because you want to give people a chance to get to know you.
[00:14:03] That was my first tip on how to get yourself on camera. I want to see you putting yourself on
[00:14:08] an Instagram story. And if you're not on Instagram, Facebook also has a similar feature where it's
[00:14:13] just you putting it up just for today. And tag me in it. First of all, tag me. It's Kim RITT-B-E-R-G,
[00:14:23] Kim Rittberg. Tag me. I will share it. I will engage. I will cheer you on. I love seeing people
[00:14:28] get on camera because as I mentioned before, showing up has completely skyrocketed my business.
[00:14:34] It's skyrocketing the business of my agents. I'm seeing it all over. So I really want that for you
[00:14:39] too. So tip number one, you're going to show up on Instagram stories. You're going to use that
[00:14:44] engagement sticker to encourage people to interact with you, putting the social back in social media.
[00:14:50] Another thing to do is practice talking to your camera. So even if you're not going to run the
[00:14:56] video on social media, which I think you should, but basically every time you're introducing yourself,
[00:15:01] every time you're thinking of something that you want to talk about, practice saying it to your
[00:15:06] camera. Your mouth and your body is a muscle just like anything else. So you actually have to say
[00:15:12] the words. Basically, if I ask you who you are and what you do, and I hear likes and ums,
[00:15:17] it means you didn't practice it enough. As I mentioned before, I do a lot of on-camera coaching.
[00:15:22] We all say ums and likes when we're reaching for words. We're trying to figure out what we're
[00:15:31] ready to go. Like basically I worked in TV, I would get to pick people who got to be on camera.
[00:15:36] I would select our guests. If I can't be confident that you can like have a really strong sound bite,
[00:15:41] you can't get on TV. So likewise, similarly, you're going to present better. Would you really
[00:15:46] understand your message? And message message is like a phrase, but message means hi, I'm Kim Rittberg.
[00:15:52] I helped real estate agents grow with income leads and credibility with video and podcasts.
[00:15:56] I came from 15 years in media and marketing and now I love helping business owners grow because I'm
[00:16:00] a business owner too. It's important to me to help people, business owners, let their content
[00:16:06] work harder for them. Do more with less. So I love empowering people to make great content
[00:16:12] that stands out without the burnout. So a little bit of that, to be honest, I was kind of making it
[00:16:17] up on the spot, but you hear there's not a lot of ums and likes because I've been practicing my
[00:16:22] pitch, practicing what I'm saying a lot. So when you're going on camera, your voice should be
[00:16:28] comfortable saying those things. So those are a few of my tips today about getting on camera.
[00:16:32] One, you're going to put yourself on video, you're going to bring people into your life on
[00:16:35] Instagram stories. Two, you're going to start talking to your camera and recording it. You're
[00:16:40] going to record it because that red light, like I said, when you record everyone feels uncomfortable,
[00:16:46] the red light steals your soul a little bit to record it. And then the third step,
[00:16:52] once you're really doing this a lot, I recommend watching it back without being super judgmental.
[00:16:57] You know, is your area lit enough? Are you standing in a dark room? Do you know what you're saying?
[00:17:04] You know, do you need to practice saying what you want to say more? It is really important to watch
[00:17:08] it back, but I recommend that for people who are really doing it for a while because I know everybody
[00:17:11] hates watching their footage back, but it is a really important aspect of improving. So that's
[00:17:17] a couple of tips of ways to improve and practice your speaking. My last tip on practicing being on
[00:17:24] camera is the same as practicing public speaking. Anytime you're in a room with other people,
[00:17:29] consider that an opportunity to be on camera, to be presentational, to speak in a
[00:17:35] presentation way. So let's say you have a caravan or you have an agent meeting, a broker meeting,
[00:17:40] and you're talking in front of 10 people or 20 people. Don't mumble casually like you would to
[00:17:45] colleagues, which is something I always did. I didn't really think to take those opportunities
[00:17:49] when I was in a more corporate setting. Take any opportunity where you're feeling a little nervous,
[00:17:55] a little sweaty baby, maybe your heart's beating a little faster. Take that opportunity to be an
[00:18:00] opportunity where you're saying, this is practice for me to get my message straight, to really speak
[00:18:07] confidently, to speak presentationally, and by presentationally, I mean just like a little more
[00:18:13] energy, a little more confidence that you might then you might at lunch with a friend. So
[00:18:18] anytime you're about to speak in front of a group, start using these tips before you go on.
[00:18:24] So basically before you go on camera, you're going to practice your breathing, you're going to
[00:18:28] breathe in for a count of four or five, then you're going to breathe out for a count of four or five.
[00:18:32] That's a great way to regulate your body, and you're going to practice what you're saying.
[00:18:38] You've already been practicing what you're saying in the privacy of your own home,
[00:18:41] recording it, and then practicing it out loud to people. These things seem small, but I'll tell you,
[00:18:45] those small moments in life adds up. They add up. More comfortable you can get on camera,
[00:18:51] the more you're attracting those ideal clients and letting them get to know you. Again,
[00:18:54] we're talking about bringing your expertise and your unique perspective and letting people see that.
[00:18:59] So, all right, those were three great tips to be on camera. So now, I'm challenging you,
[00:19:04] be on camera, put yourself on camera. No matter your social platform, find me. I'm at
[00:19:15] touch me and say, I heard you're on keeping it real and I will cheer you on. And I want to

And now, onto our show. I'm so happy to be back on Keeping It Real. I always have so much fun and please keep following me on social. Everyone who's reached out to me, I love engaging with and I love hearing from you. I'm Kim Rittberg. I help real estate agents grow their leads, income and credibility with video and podcasts. And I got here from being a TV news producer for about a decade. I launched the digital video unit for us weekly, meaning I turned an office into a live TV studio, which is basically what every single business owner has to do today. And I worked in video marketing at Netflix and Pop Shugger. And so now I take all of that experience to empower and teach real estate agents how they can leverage video and podcast to grow their own business. It's really, really fun for me. I do one-on-one and group coaching. And one thing I really want to focus on today is about being camera shy. And how you can go from camera shy to camera shine. I recently spoke at the Berkshire Hathaway Home Services National Sales Convention in Las Vegas. Yes, I flew to Vegas. I was like the only person not participating in Sin City in the world. I really was there just to speak and meet people. Anyway, it was really, really fun. There were thousands of agents there. I met so many incredible people looking to grow and invest in themselves. And one of, I taught two sessions and one of the sessions I want to drop some of the lessons that people really responded to here. And it's about how to cut through your camera shyness. How to go from camera shy to camera shine. And I want to start by saying obviously I'm a believer in video. But not just because I come from video and TV. But rather, there are all of these studies and all of these statistics that show that if you're using video, you're getting better conversion rates. And like over 85% of buyers and sellers want an agent who's using video. 90% of companies are seeing video convert to sales. So it's just a better sales tool. And when you think about a filtered headshot with three sentences on social media versus a video of a real estate agent talking about their neighborhood. Why they love it so much. Walking their dog, letting you get to know them. When you think about those two agents, if you were a buyer, who are you going to work with? So I love teaching agents how to really grow with video. But one of the things you got to get that bandaid off, you got to rip off that bandaid. I personally was camera shy when I started my business when I left corporate. But I realized very quickly that you can't be shy because hiding from the camera means hiding from clients. So today I'm going to give you a couple of tips on how to get over that fear and some tactical ways to get you on camera. So number one, I want to say by the way, when you start showing up on camera, you will have some early wins. But the truth is it's not like you make one video and suddenly a bunch of leads come in. But when you start using video in a consistent and effective and strategic way, like you have a plan, you know your messaging, you know who your ideal client is. And you understand broadly the things you're talking about. And then you're showing up consistently, whether that's twice a month or seven times a month, it really will unlock a lot of leads. I'm seeing this with my one-on-one real estate clients. I'm seeing with my group coaching clients, the people who are showing up consistently are having dormant leads, meaning people who I hadn't seen in years come back, see their content re-engage with it, and they're connecting to new people because if someone is considering you, then they go to your social page, you're in their consideration set. They're checking you out on social. They're getting to know you better there. So the more you can show up, the more you can be competitive. And the reason why it's so important to put yourself on camera is because you are your unique special sauce. Basically, if I have one video idea and I give it to a hundred real estate agents, I'm going to get a hundred different videos back because you each bring your own unique special something. So don't forget that. You know sometimes I think people feel like, oh every idea has been out there. But you are what makes it unique. Your perspective, your why, why you're an agent, why you love that neighborhood, why you love helping people. So I want to start with that. So I'm going to start with being on camera, basically. Hiding from the camera means hiding from clients. I was very camera shy when I started my business. I've really had all those negative voices in my head that you all have. I feel self-conscious. Oh my voice. Oh how do I look? I feel awkward. It's of normal feeling. Everybody feels it. I've trained on camera coach CEOs, members of Congress, celebrities, every single person feels that way. So you're in great company. And then I basically once you get your mindset, you have to really think about getting out of what I call supermodel mode. So get out of supermodel mode, stop thinking about how you look and who's looking at you and get into teacher mode. Start thinking about who you're teaching, how you're educating them. Basically, if you're showing up on camera, it's to speak to your ideal client. It's to tell them what you're about. It's to tell them who you are. It's to bring your experience and personality to the forefront. So step one, quiet those negative voices. And the best way to quiet those voices is to remember why you're putting yourself on camera. Sure, you can keep just doing home tours. You can keep posting photos of homes. But the truth is you're going to be more effective as a salesperson if you're putting videos out there. And additionally, think about this. How many meetings can you have in person each week? With one video, you can reach hundreds or thousands of people while you're out doing your business, while you're having lunch with your spouse while you're walking your dog. So just remember the power of social media is that it's working in the background. You know, those of you who are doing social a lot, you look, you're like, oh, you've even not posting a lot. You're still having hundreds or thousands of people see your content. So the time you put in gets exponentially grown. Anyway, so I'm going to return back to the concept of camera shy to camera shine. I felt that same way. I was self-conscious. The limiting beliefs I had, I'm self-conscious. Who wants to hear from me? Am I really an expert? I mean, I do think of an expert. That was one of the beliefs I had less, but I know a lot of people feel like, who am I? Why does anyone want to hear my perspective? But you have to remember, you're only talking to your ideal client. So you're going to ignore any of those negative voices you're hearing in your head. When you're feeling self-conscious, you're envisioning Nancy from high school, who was mean to you in the cafeteria or you're envisioning John, the colleague who stabbed you in the back. Those people are not following on social. If they are, and you feel like they're writing mean things, it's in their own head. It's their negative. It's their negativity, but truly, attention is so hard to get. It's so hard to get attention. So probably they're not paying attention to you. They're probably thinking about what they're cooking for dinner. So don't give them any power. Don't give them any weight. Really talk to your ideal client. Identify who you're talking to and make every video for that person. And then the more you do that, you'll start realizing that they're responding. They're there. They're there for you. So we're going to stop hiding from the clients. Once I personally, once I stopped hiding from the camera, I started putting myself on camera and I'm seeing this for all of my clients. I had one video, bring me three new clients. I did one video. I immediately got three new clients. I've tripled my speaking engagements. I've quadrupled my inbound leads, meaning on LinkedIn, on Instagram, I get notifications. I get emails for discovery calls every single week, because I'm not there on podcasts, because I'm out there speaking, because I'm out there putting myself on social. But it took me a while to get there. So it's not like it just happened overnight. And so I want you to get there. I'm seeing that happen to my agent, one of my agents David. He had somebody pop into his phone. Hey, loving what you're putting out there, you want to grab lunch. Somebody hadn't seen in years. This CEO of his company had messaged him saying he's liking his content. So it's both for your clients, but it's also for peers. It's for referrals. You know, we're getting out of basically to go from camera shy to camera shine. We're getting out of supermodel mode. We're getting into teacher mode. That's the biggest, biggest thing. That's the number one mindset thing. I cannot stress it enough. I'm not a huge person who reads books about mindset and self-help, but I'm very much in touch with who I am and fighting through the things that hold me back. I had a lot of fear to start my own business. I had a lot of fear to put myself out there. I'm now speaking on national stages. I'm now contributing to Fast Company magazine. I've been written up in business insider. Those things are all happening because I started showing up. So I'm such an advocate of bringing yourself out there, putting yourself out there, telling yourself you deserve it and you're worth it because it's worth it to push through. So you have to get through that mindset. And then after you're getting through that mindset, you're repairing your body. So you have to remember that when you're talking, the camera is stealing our energy. So the best way to counteract that is to practice being authentic on camera. And I realize that's a little ironic, but people are like, just be yourself. Don't try to be yourself. Try to be yourself on video. It's a different version of you. It's one where you have to practice breathing and get yourself psyched up before you go on camera. But remember that we all are a little frozen, a little robotic on camera at first. That's okay. Video number one will be worse than video five. We'll be worse than video 10. But once you're 10 videos in, 20 videos in, 30 videos in, you're going to be like, oh, okay, I'm showing up more as myself, but you have it takes practice. It takes practice just like every other thing. So preparing your mindset is you're getting on a supermodel mode. You're getting into teacher mode. And you're preparing your body. You are actually preparing and practicing. And the best way to practice is by putting yourself on camera. So I'm going to give you a challenge this week. I'm going to check in on you. I know a lot of you are following me on social now, which is amazing. And I love it. You are going to put yourself on camera. And basically putting yourself on camera can be any of these things. The best way to do it is just start talking to your camera in a very casual way. You just like, what does your day look like? So for example, I would put my camera up. Hold it out as far as I can. Hold it up a little higher than I line. So we're not getting that up the nose, up the chin angle. And I'm just going to bring my social followers into my day. Hey, everyone. I'm back from Vegas. I'm super jet lag. I'm going to drink a little lots of coffee. My kids are on spring break. So I'm going to spend some time with them. And then I have a lot of follow up emails from all the great people I met. And a couple of a few calls. And then I'm going to take my kids to paint art at a new craft studio in Brooklyn. And then I might also, here's a tip, we put that video out on Instagram Stories. Basically Instagram Stories disappears after 24 hours. So if you hate the video, don't worry, it's gone. But Instagram Stories is a great way to really connect with people and bring them in in a more sincere way. It's less filtered. It's not necessarily like a home tour. And it's not necessarily even commentary on the market. It's just you bringing people into your day. Obviously, you want to tie it a little bit to your job. So as I mentioned in that video, I just shot. I mentioned I just went to a speaking engagement. I mentioned I'm a parent because that is a part of my life. And other parents really connect with that. So in those videos, you can mention things about your life. If you have a pet, if you play basketball, if you love football, if you have kids, something that lets people connect with you on a personal level. And then my other tip is in Instagram Stories, there are these things called stickers. It's that little smiley face square. If you put out a poll like if I wrote, I'm having my coffee, I'm super jet lagged, I love coffee. I can't live without my coffee. A poll you could put in there is coffee or tea. And people will vote coffee or tea. This is just a way to engage with people, just to say, actually, who's watching my stories? And you'll be surprised. Sometimes people will respond to the poll and I'm like, oh, I didn't realize that person is following me or engaging with my content. That's interesting. Maybe you want to reach out to that person. You should engage with their content. So we're bringing that social aspect back into social media. But again, the best way to do that is by putting our face in there because you want to give people a chance to get to know you. That was my first tip on how to get yourself on camera. I want to see you putting yourself on an Instagram story. And if you're not on Instagram, Facebook also has a similar feature where it's just you putting it up just for today. And tag me in it. First of all, tag me. It's Kim RITT-B-E-R-G, Kim Rittberg. Tag me. I will share it. I will engage. I will cheer you on. I love seeing people get on camera because as I mentioned before, showing up has completely skyrocketed my business. It's skyrocketing the business of my agents. I'm seeing it all over. So I really want that for you too. So tip number one, you're going to show up on Instagram stories. You're going to use that engagement sticker to encourage people to interact with you, putting the social back in social media. Another thing to do is practice talking to your camera. So even if you're not going to run the video on social media, which I think you should, but basically every time you're introducing yourself, every time you're thinking of something that you want to talk about, practice saying it to your camera. Your mouth and your body is a muscle just like anything else. So you actually have to say the words. Basically, if I ask you who you are and what you do, and I hear likes and ums, it means you didn't practice it enough. As I mentioned before, I do a lot of on-camera coaching. We all say ums and likes when we're reaching for words. We're trying to figure out what we're ready to go. Like basically I worked in TV, I would get to pick people who got to be on camera. I would select our guests. If I can't be confident that you can like have a really strong sound bite, you can't get on TV. So likewise, similarly, you're going to present better. Would you really understand your message? And message message is like a phrase, but message means hi, I'm Kim Rittberg. I helped real estate agents grow with income leads and credibility with video and podcasts. I came from 15 years in media and marketing and now I love helping business owners grow because I'm a business owner too. It's important to me to help people, business owners, let their content work harder for them. Do more with less. So I love empowering people to make great content that stands out without the burnout. So a little bit of that, to be honest, I was kind of making it up on the spot, but you hear there's not a lot of ums and likes because I've been practicing my pitch, practicing what I'm saying a lot. So when you're going on camera, your voice should be comfortable saying those things. So those are a few of my tips today about getting on camera. One, you're going to put yourself on video, you're going to bring people into your life on Instagram stories. Two, you're going to start talking to your camera and recording it. You're going to record it because that red light, like I said, when you record everyone feels uncomfortable, the red light steals your soul a little bit to record it. And then the third step, once you're really doing this a lot, I recommend watching it back without being super judgmental. You know, is your area lit enough? Are you standing in a dark room? Do you know what you're saying? You know, do you need to practice saying what you want to say more? It is really important to watch it back, but I recommend that for people who are really doing it for a while because I know everybody hates watching their footage back, but it is a really important aspect of improving. So that's a couple of tips of ways to improve and practice your speaking. My last tip on practicing being on camera is the same as practicing public speaking. Anytime you're in a room with other people, consider that an opportunity to be on camera, to be presentational, to speak in a presentation way. So let's say you have a caravan or you have an agent meeting, a broker meeting, and you're talking in front of 10 people or 20 people. Don't mumble casually like you would to colleagues, which is something I always did. I didn't really think to take those opportunities when I was in a more corporate setting. Take any opportunity where you're feeling a little nervous, a little sweaty baby, maybe your heart's beating a little faster. Take that opportunity to be an opportunity where you're saying, this is practice for me to get my message straight, to really speak confidently, to speak presentationally, and by presentationally, I mean just like a little more energy, a little more confidence that you might then you might at lunch with a friend. So anytime you're about to speak in front of a group, start using these tips before you go on. So basically before you go on camera, you're going to practice your breathing, you're going to breathe in for a count of four or five, then you're going to breathe out for a count of four or five. That's a great way to regulate your body, and you're going to practice what you're saying. You've already been practicing what you're saying in the privacy of your own home, recording it, and then practicing it out loud to people. These things seem small, but I'll tell you, those small moments in life adds up. They add up. More comfortable you can get on camera, the more you're attracting those ideal clients and letting them get to know you. Again, we're talking about bringing your expertise and your unique perspective and letting people see that. So, all right, those were three great tips to be on camera. So now, I'm challenging you, be on camera, put yourself on camera. No matter your social platform, find me. I'm at touch me and say, I heard you're on keeping it real and I will cheer you on.
