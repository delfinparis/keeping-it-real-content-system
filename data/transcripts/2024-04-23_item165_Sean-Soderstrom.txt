[00:03:19] But let's get to the main event.
[00:03:20] My conversation with Sean Sotistrum.
[00:03:36] Today on the show we have Sean Sotistrum from corded.io which is a recruiting and retention
[00:03:43] platform for agents, brokerages and teams.
[00:03:47] Let me tell you more about Sean.
[00:03:48] Now Sean is the co founder and CEO of accorded which provides brokerages and teams with recruiting
[00:03:55] retention and coaching software.
[00:03:57] Now prior to accorded Sean was an associate partner and the co lead from a Kinseyan company's
[00:04:02] residential real estate practice in North America where he advised leading brokerages, online
[00:04:07] listing portals and software companies.
[00:04:10] Prior to that Sean joined urban Compass which is now known as Compass where he was there
[00:04:15] when there was only 30 employees at the company and he built and led the expansion and growth
[00:04:20] function for the company launching and managing compasses first 40 offices outside of New York
[00:04:26] and we've all seen what has happened with Compass over the years.
[00:04:29] And Sean please everybody visit corded at courtd.io.
[00:04:36] We'll have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:04:38] I have been testing this piece of software.
[00:04:41] It's one of the most incredible things I've seen in 14 years of working in this industry.
[00:04:45] So Sean welcome to keeping it real.
[00:04:49] DJ thanks so much for having me on and and protesting out corded.
[00:04:53] I really appreciate the opportunity to chat with you this afternoon.
[00:04:57] Yeah let's talk about and by the way your background is really impressive.
[00:05:03] For those that don't know, McKinsey is widely respected as one of the top white glove consulting
[00:05:09] agencies in the world.
[00:05:10] They have their reputation is is beyond reproach as well as of course working with Compass
[00:05:16] and you help them expand and really start to grow their brand and now they feel like
[00:05:21] feels like they've taken over the whole country.
[00:05:23] It's just incredible.
[00:05:24] Even though technically we're a competitor of theirs in a sense, I've been nothing but
[00:05:30] in by everybody I know who works in McKinsey and everybody I know that works at Compass.
[00:05:34] So you've come from some some good stock there and I love your new tool because I rarely
[00:05:40] ever have tech partners on our show because I oftentimes I'm really just not that impressed
[00:05:47] quite honestly with a lot of tools.
[00:05:49] Of course there are tools I like but yours is really something unique and different.
[00:05:54] So before we get to corded, tell us about your background.
[00:05:57] Tell us how you got started in real estate.
[00:06:01] Yeah thanks for that very warm introduction.
[00:06:04] So yeah, as you mentioned, I started my career at McKinsey and for me graduating from
[00:06:11] college actually in Chicago, I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do.
[00:06:15] So I figured if I got the opportunity to work in a few different industries with companies
[00:06:22] and maybe test out things from strategy to operations to some more technology related
[00:06:29] projects, then I'd maybe get a better sense of what I wanted to do.
[00:06:34] And I think one of the fun things after that, you know, I spent about three years there
[00:06:39] and then I had the opportunity, I had the opportunity to go meet Robert Reffkin over at Compass.
[00:06:45] And you know if anyone's nothing as met him, he's a very convincing guy and he's got a
[00:06:52] big vision about things that he wants to do and the way that he sees the world.
[00:06:57] I think it was 36 hours later, I was working for him at urban Compass now Compass.
[00:07:04] And so it was a really, really fun experience for me.
[00:07:07] I learned a lot.
[00:07:09] There were some exceptionally talented people that I got to work alongside.
[00:07:12] And yeah, even the first week was really funny there.
[00:07:17] I can talk about it for a minute.
[00:07:18] The way he recruited me was he said, Sean, you know, I know you're coming from the structured
[00:07:24] job at McKinsey, he had had that job as well himself a few years before.
[00:07:28] And he said, the first thing that you're going to do on your first day is write the job
[00:07:31] description for yourself in the company.
[00:07:33] And I was like, that sounds amazing.
[00:07:35] I'm coming from this super organized, super structured company where we're giving people
[00:07:39] advice and helping them with things.
[00:07:40] I get to write my own job description, that sounds amazing.
[00:07:44] So I jumped in, I started doing that in the first morning and I came up with leading national
[00:07:50] expansion and growth of the company.
[00:07:52] And he looked at me and he's like, you know, we have no market share in New York.
[00:07:56] And we're just getting started.
[00:07:58] And we're not even close to expanding this business.
[00:08:01] And I don't even know what you'd be figuring out.
[00:08:03] This sounds like a good job description for a few years from now.
[00:08:06] I said, bro, but you know, give me a few minutes to like put it all together.
[00:08:10] And a few months later, we had expanded into DC.
[00:08:12] And then, you know, we obviously had a number of new markets off to that.
[00:08:16] So that was a really fun experience getting to get it, you know, really, that was my first
[00:08:21] experience in residential real estate.
[00:08:23] And I was fascinated by the opportunity and also so many that, you know, that I encountered
[00:08:28] and that we were trying to solve a Compass, some well and some still probably need to
[00:08:32] be figured out.
[00:08:33] And then I actually went back to McKinsey after that and helped to start build out their
[00:08:39] real estate practice and had the chance to work with some really fantastic brokerages,
[00:08:43] developers, had the opportunity to work with private equity firms that were looking at
[00:08:48] tech companies in the real estate space.
[00:08:50] So I could kind of take a look at the landscape from a few different angles and vantage points,
[00:08:55] which was really helpful and just, you know, I think has informed a lot of my perspectives
[00:09:00] today.
[00:09:02] Yeah, it's really, it's really interesting.
[00:09:04] So your background really wasn't so much in real estate until you got to the Compass
[00:09:10] side and then back to McKinsey.
[00:09:11] And it's interesting that you saw this opportunity to create a new piece of software that really
[00:09:19] really didn't exist.
[00:09:21] And I know it didn't exist because I have been searching for a tool like this personally
[00:09:25] for my own work here at Kale Realty for since 2011.
[00:09:31] And there are a few solutions out there, but they don't really do what courted does.
[00:09:36] And I think this is, I was telling Sean, he already knows this, but I was telling him
[00:09:40] how I think this is so well positioned at the, really where we are presently in the timeline
[00:09:47] of REALTOR stuff because obviously things are changing in NAR.
[00:09:51] We're starting to see some concerns about things like buyer commissions and agents having
[00:09:57] to understand how to express their value proposition and get paid a little bit in a different
[00:10:02] way possibly.
[00:10:04] And we're seeing a lot of flight to teams.
[00:10:06] We're seeing a lot of flight all over the place.
[00:10:07] I know that you guys keep really close tabs on migration when it comes to agents moving
[00:10:13] brokerages.
[00:10:14] And I know last year was a huge year for movement.
[00:10:17] And I know that because I saw that as well here at R firm and to have a tool that actually
[00:10:22] really does give somebody like me.
[00:10:26] Now, I have a unique position.
[00:10:27] So I know this can be a little bit of a disconnect for our audience.
[00:10:30] I want to reconnect everybody.
[00:10:32] So I know people listening are probably not recruiters, but are you thinking about either
[00:10:37] building a team or joining a team or you already have a team and you want to keep the
[00:10:42] people you have on it?
[00:10:43] This is a tool that is really designed to do all of that.
[00:10:47] And I have not seen any real leaps forward in the technology in the last 10 years or so.
[00:10:57] And then Sean came along and said you should check this out.
[00:11:00] And boy was I blown away.
[00:11:01] So tell us about Corden.
[00:11:03] Yes.
[00:11:04] So much of the inspiration for the platform, I think comes from the series of experiences
[00:11:11] that my self and some of our co-founders have as well.
[00:11:14] So I think in my seat at Compass, we're obviously tasked with wanting to grow the business.
[00:11:21] And I think as we look at just some of the dynamics in the space, you have, we're on track
[00:11:31] to see about 25% of productive agents.
[00:11:33] So agents who have done at least one deal in the last 12 months move between brokerages
[00:11:38] this year.
[00:11:40] And that number was about 17 and a half percent last year.
[00:11:43] This data is relatively hard to track down.
[00:11:45] So we just think about that.
[00:11:47] One in four agents moving is significant, right?
[00:11:51] It's a significant amount of turnover.
[00:11:54] And so when we think about that, then obviously, most agents would say, I'm the one paying
[00:11:59] the brokerage and I agree with that.
[00:12:01] And so as a result, the agents obviously make a very, typically a very large portion of
[00:12:07] the commissions that are earned.
[00:12:08] And so agents are really important to the brokerages.
[00:12:11] And as a result, and of course, agents are the folks that formulate into teams, inform
[00:12:19] into teams.
[00:12:20] And so for me, in this industry, I still believe it's all about the agent, regardless
[00:12:25] of what happens with settlements and other things in the future.
[00:12:29] It's a very personal experience and the agent has so much leverage.
[00:12:33] It's great for agents to understand that, right?
[00:12:37] And realize that brokerage or team should be lucky to have you, right?
[00:12:40] And in that respect, it's this interesting dynamic in this industry where usually the brokerage
[00:12:49] of the team doesn't just gather applications and then sort through them.
[00:12:52] There's actually an opportunity to hunt, right?
[00:12:54] To actually go through and identify who meets my criteria and then go through a process
[00:13:00] and then hopefully bring someone on.
[00:13:02] And my, you know, back to your question, I think part of the reason to start the platform
[00:13:07] is that process of hunting, that process of building the team with the right people,
[00:13:12] to me, that's always felt very time consuming and very expensive.
[00:13:19] And I do believe that there's an opportunity to use the data that's available in the industry,
[00:13:25] right?
[00:13:25] People often talk about how much data that is available.
[00:13:28] But I think a technology company that's working for you should make sense of it
[00:13:32] and should really put you in a position where you can make those decisions,
[00:13:36] good decisions and also make those decisions quickly.
[00:13:39] And so that's really how we try to orient the platform to be helpful.
[00:13:43] And we do have many teams that use the platform for a variety of brokerages,
[00:13:47] from brokerages where the teams themselves are incentivized to get other people
[00:13:52] to join the teams, to very traditional teams with three or four agents
[00:13:56] or maybe a solo practitioner who's looking to recruit their first agent
[00:14:01] and they want that person to actually be profitable and help them
[00:14:04] in the first three months from a financial perspective,
[00:14:07] not just someone who's going to take a bunch of time to get ramped up
[00:14:12] and learn the business at the new team.
[00:14:15] And so we can observe across the space,
[00:14:17] but yeah, it's been a really fun journey so far.
[00:14:20] Yeah, and so let's talk about sort of the existing tools out there
[00:14:23] and then what you are doing that's different.
[00:14:25] So for everyone who is interested in building a team
[00:14:29] or increasing the head count at their brokerage
[00:14:32] or even just retaining who you already have,
[00:14:35] there are some tools that assist and they're usually in the form of a CRM.
[00:14:39] The CRM may be connected to MLS data.
[00:14:43] So you can basically take a look and slice and dice data
[00:14:46] and you say, oh, this person might appear that they had a bad year last year.
[00:14:51] So maybe there's a reason to reach out and see if they may want to move
[00:14:54] or they had a really good year and maybe that's a reason to reach out.
[00:14:58] And it also, these tools have been around actually for a long time,
[00:15:01] but yours goes really a step way beyond that
[00:15:04] because the data is there.
[00:15:06] It's almost like I was thinking about this with Google Analytics.
[00:15:11] So if anyone's ever set up Google Analytics on a website,
[00:15:13] it's really easy to do.
[00:15:14] It's just a little basically a little identifier you put it in
[00:15:17] and it starts tracking, but trying to make sense of Google Analytics data
[00:15:21] is actually somewhat complicated and at least in my opinion.
[00:15:24] And you really almost need somebody who understands Google Analytics data
[00:15:28] and say, here's what all this really means.
[00:15:30] Here are some action steps.
[00:15:31] Google Analytics, maybe one day it'll get there
[00:15:33] and it'll tell you you should really do this and this,
[00:15:35] but doesn't really do that yet.
[00:15:37] Your system does a couple of things.
[00:15:40] First of all, I want to say, there's so many cool things about this tool.
[00:15:43] It's going to sound like I'm doing a commercial for it,
[00:15:45] but I am so impressed with this.
[00:15:47] I've wanted something like this.
[00:15:48] First of all, what it can do is you as the brokerage or the team,
[00:15:53] you can literally go in and say, here are all the things I offer for my agents.
[00:15:58] Here's what I do for splits.
[00:16:00] Here are the awards we've won.
[00:16:02] Here's how we train.
[00:16:04] Here's our marketing we do, the tools, etc.
[00:16:07] You can literally tell, courted.
[00:16:09] Here's all the stuff we do.
[00:16:10] By the way, courted also can scan your recruiting website
[00:16:13] and pull all sorts of information and it will do that anyway.
[00:16:17] And then on top of that, you can feed it information about,
[00:16:20] here's what we offer.
[00:16:21] Here's our value proposition.
[00:16:22] So in doing that, then what it does is courted, again,
[00:16:27] does have access to this MLS data,
[00:16:29] but it goes a step beyond just saying, hey, this is this person's production.
[00:16:33] Here's what they did in the last year,
[00:16:34] which is what other tools have done.
[00:16:36] It actually interprets the data and then gives you an action step.
[00:16:40] So what will literally tell you, I'll give you a great example.
[00:16:43] One of the ways that this system works is it looks at people who have left your firm
[00:16:48] or maybe your team.
[00:16:49] If someone who was a good producer and they've left,
[00:16:51] well, you hopefully would want to get them back someday if you want them to come back.
[00:16:55] And this tool gives you a reason to reach out to somebody who's maybe left your firm.
[00:17:00] And it says, hey, you should reach out to this person.
[00:17:02] They, Sean and his team called these boomerang agents.
[00:17:05] These are agents that Sean and his team have decided based on various data points
[00:17:11] that this person is probably poised to move.
[00:17:14] And so I actually used that a lot this week.
[00:17:16] I reached out to a bunch of agents that had left us over the last several years.
[00:17:20] And I was, and I had reasons to reach out to them.
[00:17:22] Not just, hey, we want you back because we send those out anyway.
[00:17:25] I send that out every quarter.
[00:17:26] Hey, I want you back.
[00:17:27] But now I was like, hey, I want you back.
[00:17:29] And congratulations.
[00:17:30] You're up 54% from last year.
[00:17:32] That's incredible.
[00:17:33] And so anyway, that's just one of the, one of the cool features.
[00:17:36] But this idea of indicators of interest or indicators of movement,
[00:17:42] you guys have that magic formula that you're continually refining
[00:17:45] based on all these different signals.
[00:17:48] And you're basically telling us, it's basically like a CRM that tells you what to do when.
[00:17:54] Is essentially the way I think about it.
[00:17:58] Yeah, so I think I just reflect on my own experience, right?
[00:18:03] Where over the course of a few years, my team and I have recruited about 1,500 agents
[00:18:09] to a company.
[00:18:10] And when we looked at that, conversion rates were still something that we were working on,
[00:18:16] right? They were relatively low, right?
[00:18:19] And we were looking at that and we were kind of thinking about a few things.
[00:18:22] One is the agents who are more lower on the production spectrum or kind of emerging agents
[00:18:30] tend to move more.
[00:18:31] And then the agents who are more established tend to move less.
[00:18:33] So in the one to five million dollar segment, close to one in five agents move between
[00:18:38] companies every year.
[00:18:39] In the $50 million plus segment, only one in 20 agents are moving between firms every year.
[00:18:45] So that's just one just kind of data point.
[00:18:48] I think the other component that we started to pay attention to was
[00:18:53] not every agent every day is as likely to move as another day.
[00:18:58] And so at the individual agent level, it can be really hard to identify
[00:19:04] for whom it's the right time for them to hear from you, right?
[00:19:08] So we can now start to not think about what's easy for me, the team lead,
[00:19:11] but what's good for the candidate hearing for me, right?
[00:19:15] So in terms of the right time.
[00:19:16] And then as you mentioned, there's another kind of aspect to this, which is,
[00:19:21] so what do I say now?
[00:19:22] Do I send ever on the same trick campaign?
[00:19:25] And we've inserted their name and so we think it's personalized.
[00:19:28] Or can we go a step beyond that?
[00:19:30] And I think what's interesting now is that as we said, there's so much data available in the
[00:19:35] industry and technology has advanced so much over the last even just two or three years
[00:19:41] that we can start to formulate really personalized messages in seconds and they can actually
[00:19:46] be generated for you that are highly specific.
[00:19:49] That follow all of the best practices a coach would tell you, right?
[00:19:52] So a coach would say, you know, be specific, show that you've done your homework,
[00:19:57] talk about your connection to them if you have one.
[00:20:00] Then you have the right, maybe to talk about the company.
[00:20:02] And so we can actually create those for you in a way that helps you save a lot of time.
[00:20:07] And so we think of, we think of this as kind of precision targeting, but doing it really quickly.
[00:20:14] And then the other aspect to it that you're alluding to is there's a very strong
[00:20:19] predictive analytics and data science component to what we do.
[00:20:23] And so these terms are complicated and they all branches of AI, but we actually interact with
[00:20:29] them all the time.
[00:20:30] So when Netflix recommends another action movie from the 80s, that's an example of Netflix helping
[00:20:36] you to get to the point where you can watch a movie quickly, right?
[00:20:40] It's not always the perfect recommendation, but oftentimes you'll just click on it and start watching.
[00:20:44] And so that's an example of the core to candidates where we will kind of start to understand
[00:20:48] different types of segments that are good for you and that you interact with them and
[00:20:51] recommend more agents like that in the interest of not having analysis paralysis,
[00:20:57] but in the interest of you having five minutes and still being able to try to reach out to
[00:21:01] somebody in five minutes or less.
[00:21:03] And I think the other element to it is, I think, again, reflect on my own experience.
[00:21:09] It was really hard for me to understand based on historical production, whether a five million
[00:21:15] dollar producer or a 20 million dollar producer had just had the best year of their career or
[00:21:20] their best years were in front of them.
[00:21:21] The only way I really felt like I could understand that was by meeting them and having a personal
[00:21:25] relationship. But it's really hard to have a personal relationship with 25,000 agents in Chicago,
[00:21:31] right? And so how do you go from that long list down to the people who you should even call
[00:21:36] today? So this is a process where we use a very kind of deep, deep data analysis where we essentially
[00:21:44] reconstruct every single agent over the course of their career and we start to compare not only
[00:21:48] their production changes to relative to themselves, but we start to look at things like
[00:21:53] quality of sales metrics. So close to list price ratio and price for square foot and days on market
[00:21:58] and compare it to other agents who sell similar homes at the same time. And then we look at
[00:22:03] quality of sales metrics. Like, are you selling high floor in the apartment? What is your interior
[00:22:08] lot square footed interior square footage ratio to the lot square footage to try to understand
[00:22:13] the types of homes that you're selling? And then even office dynamics. So any agent listening
[00:22:17] that's been unfortunately through a process where your loved manager has turned over after 10 years
[00:22:23] and the three top agents just left your office, that creates a question at least for yourself.
[00:22:27] Is this still the right place for me? And so we measured those dynamics in real time as well.
[00:22:33] And those are all formulated into predictions of sales volume and predictions of folks being likely
[00:22:37] to potentially leave their firm, which can help a team lead to really kind of narrow in on who are
[00:22:44] the five people I should actually speak to today because I have just a few minutes. Yeah, boy,
[00:22:49] you said so much and I really love the fact that I can look at a candidate in courted and you have
[00:22:57] predicted what their next 12 months is going to look like. I can see all of their production pretty
[00:23:02] much through their entire career, the data that you have. But the most important thing again is that
[00:23:07] what do we think they're going to do next year? And that isn't something that I would easily be able
[00:23:13] to, I wouldn't be able to do it in the way that you have you guys have all these data points that
[00:23:17] are used, you know, into reference, for example, like the Netflix example Netflix is a self-correcting
[00:23:23] system. So it sends you, so is Google and many other pieces of software that are self-correcting.
[00:23:31] So they predict then they then they they correct, right? And so what I love is that you have all
[00:23:37] of these data points that are able to do what I just, I'm not able to, not only to determine who
[00:23:42] might be wanting to move and who's going to have a next couple of great years in front of them
[00:23:48] that maybe their own managing broker, their own team doesn't see in them. Maybe because again,
[00:23:52] they just don't have these predictive analytics. And also who might be leaving my company,
[00:23:58] even though everything on on the surface looks great, they're had a great year, everything looks good
[00:24:03] and all of a sudden there's a like a warning in courted, hey, this person might might be considering
[00:24:08] moving. Well, and if we think like how would courted know that? Well, this is just all database.
[00:24:13] There's that famous story that probably everyone has has read or heard about with Target being able
[00:24:19] to predict pregnancy before the person even knows their pregnant. And that's not just a cute story.
[00:24:25] It actually is true. Their predictive analytics are so strong that there was a story of a woman who
[00:24:30] didn't even know she was pregnant, starting to get pregnancy coupons in the mail from Target,
[00:24:34] because Target figured it out before she even knew. And that's how smart this data can be and how
[00:24:39] predictive and how accurate it can be. So I love that you're taking some of what what consumer,
[00:24:46] you know, retail consumer big box stores have had for years, groceries have it and big retailers have
[00:24:53] it, but bringing that to the real estate space. It is it is remarkable. And I if nothing else, if
[00:25:01] you're like, well, I don't want to recruit, you definitely want to retain. So if you're not recruiting,
[00:25:06] you got to and well, you should do both. But this is a tool, even if you're not looking to grow,
[00:25:11] you just want to keep your your your your people happy. And yes, personal relationships,
[00:25:16] of course, are going to ultimately win the day. But this is going to tell you who Sean and his
[00:25:20] team think maybe considering a move and you can and you can then begin to give that person more
[00:25:26] individual attention and hopefully change it so that that if they have that urge that that urge
[00:25:32] is is quashed. I think you just said it again, right? It connects to to my point earlier about
[00:25:41] this being an industry that's really built around agents. It's really also built around relationships,
[00:25:46] right? So we're talking about relatively complicated technology. But at the end of the day,
[00:25:52] the application is very simple. And the what the intent here is as a team lead from a recruiting
[00:25:59] perspective, what your best at is probably sitting face to face with the potential candidate and
[00:26:05] talking to them about how their business is going to change and their career is going to change
[00:26:09] when they join my team, right? What we are attempting to do is take the guesswork of figuring out
[00:26:14] who's the right fit and what's the right time and what do I say to them in order to get them into
[00:26:19] that meeting. We kind of will handle a lot of that for you so that you can spend more time
[00:26:24] maximizing your time in that recruiting session. Or as you said from a retention perspective,
[00:26:30] yes, we do identify vulnerability in a team or in a brokerage, but it's also so much information
[00:26:36] in one place that's relatively easily digestible. At least we've tried to make it so that your
[00:26:41] conversation doesn't need to start with how's it going unless you want to unless you want to start
[00:26:47] that way. It can start with, hey, DJ, congrats on six closes on the list side last year. You're
[00:26:53] your days on market. It was 15 days and your 100 and your close list price ratio was 103%,
[00:26:59] which is way higher than people who sell the similar homes in Skokie, Illinois.
[00:27:04] Tell me about your approach to pricing and the only thing I'm going to try to help you with is
[00:27:08] how do we elevate that price point a little bit because you're doing a fantastic job.
[00:27:12] And so we can elevate the conversation, but it doesn't take any more time. In fact,
[00:27:17] it should take less time to start that conversation, but it's still about your relationship with your
[00:27:21] own nature. So there's no AI, you know, talking on the half review or doing anything crazy like that.
[00:27:27] It's really just how do we how do we kind of make sense of the data that's available and kind of
[00:27:32] bring it to your needs. Yeah, I'll tell you exactly what this the the itch that this scratch the scratch
[00:27:38] that this is to say the expression right. This scratch is an itch for me and I'll tell you exactly
[00:27:43] what it is. I have been waiting and I'm sure this will come very shortly, but it isn't quite here
[00:27:48] yet with AI. I am waiting for the day that we have a personal assistant that every we wake up in
[00:27:54] the morning and it's like, Hey, I looked at calendar. I looked at your to do's. It's connected with,
[00:27:58] you know, all of my different software solutions. You're going to do this first. You're going to do
[00:28:03] this second. Here's what your day looks like and oh, by the way, remember to pick up this on the
[00:28:06] way home and it's coming. It's going to happen all the to do systems. I'm sure are working on that.
[00:28:11] It's not here yet, but you've actually built kind of that already, which is really cool because
[00:28:16] what I can do is I can log in and I can get a prompt to like Sean, you were saying, it is time
[00:28:22] consuming to look up someone's production. It is time consuming to look up, you know, different
[00:28:27] data points that and then try to make sense of it. I log in to court it and it literally shows me
[00:28:33] right to my face, call this person for this reason, say this. It even gives me prompts on what to say
[00:28:38] or what to email. If you want to email, you can you can text as well. But it actually again,
[00:28:44] it knows all about your firm because you've given it this information. It starts to formulate a
[00:28:50] argument or a persuasive reason to maybe reach out. And what Sean said is really cool because
[00:28:55] there's so many cool data points in here that when I'm doing a recruiting call, people typically
[00:29:00] know their production. They know about what they've sold in the number of units, but they don't know,
[00:29:05] a lot of times they don't know like days on market compared to other people or that it's sold for
[00:29:10] higher, you know, over asking than, then, you know, other homes that have been sold recently.
[00:29:16] And what I can do when I have that conversation is say, hey, just out of curiosity, I don't know if
[00:29:20] you knew this, but you're actually selling homes 10% faster than everybody in your market. How are you,
[00:29:26] and what Sean says is, there's two ways to go with that. You can just be like, that's amazing.
[00:29:31] We want to have somebody who can do that on our team. You're amazing. But you could also use it
[00:29:36] as a conversation starter. Like, God, I'd love to know how you do that. And that is one of the
[00:29:41] most flattering things you could ever say. And again, think about not recruiting, but retention,
[00:29:48] knowing this about your own agents, going, God, I'm so proud you're on our team. You sell things 10%
[00:29:53] faster. How are you doing that? Imagine what that would do to somebody's feeling of connection to
[00:29:59] their own brokerage. Right? Now, are their own managing brokers doing that? Probably not. So you
[00:30:03] need a tool like this to keep the people because guys like me are going to come along and call
[00:30:08] those agents and be like, did you know this? And they're going to say, I didn't even know that
[00:30:11] myself. Nobody at my firm told me. So these are these are the reasons and you and I can't tell you
[00:30:17] how time consuming it used to be to even find any bit of this data and then research it, reach out,
[00:30:24] you're right. It was a time killer. So this is it. And I will say this too for any teams that are
[00:30:29] listening. I know a lot of teams here in Chicago, we have a lot of teams at our firm as well. I am,
[00:30:34] I am really immersed in the in in teams just because it's so commonplace. And the top teams
[00:30:41] always have the same biggest complaint. It's so hard to recruit. That's what every top team tells
[00:30:47] me. They're like, it's hard to get good people. This is a tool that will just allow allow that
[00:30:51] to happen much more simply. And if you're a brokerage where the managing broker is doing recruiting,
[00:30:56] I'm not the managing broker. I get to recruit all day. Most most firms don't have somebody like me.
[00:31:01] So they're doing a lot of different things, keeping the business running, making sure compliance is
[00:31:06] in place, doing all of the other hats that they have to wear. This allows them to literally log in
[00:31:10] and they don't have to think about it. They just click on somebody that they either want to recruit
[00:31:14] or retain and they have reasons to reach out and courted prompts you. It's so cool. It tells you
[00:31:19] exactly what they might suggest as a prompt to have a conversation.
[00:31:26] Yeah, I think there's another kind of dynamic here, right? Which is, I'm often I'm an avid consumer
[00:31:32] of real estate news, right? So I'm on these different websites, many times a day trying to understand
[00:31:38] what's happening. And I found that that only told me one small part of the market, right? There
[00:31:45] was a few firms that tend to get covered a lot in the news and that's kind of the only ones that I
[00:31:51] really was kind of learning about. And then when we had the system, we decided to also build a
[00:31:56] view of the brokerages and of the teams. And so we could start to understand in Chicago, which are
[00:32:01] the teams that are growing faster than the other ones, which are the brokerages that in the last month
[00:32:05] lost the most agents, or gained the most agents. And so some of this kind of migration analysis,
[00:32:10] but specifically thinking about it from a team and brokerage perspective, I think is, it's just
[00:32:15] really helpful in terms of making a decision about where you want to end up, or who do you want to
[00:32:20] attach to in the long run, right? And so I think that information can be powerful. And I think that
[00:32:26] the idea, though, of our platform, or that the intent, right, is to try to have a guided experience
[00:32:33] so that it's not kind of create your own adventure. Of course, you can if you want to, but the idea
[00:32:38] is to try to bring you what you need when you need it, such that you can save time and get back
[00:32:44] to selling real estate or get back to all the hundred other things that you need to do that are not
[00:32:47] recruiting and retention. And so it's hopefully a kind of saving time through that. Yeah, it's amazing.
[00:32:52] And just to wet our appetites on any any future features or benefits are, and I don't know what
[00:33:00] you're able to share, what gives kept under wraps, but whatever you're able to share, where do you
[00:33:04] see the evolution of courted going in the future? Yeah, so there's a whole bunch of things that we have
[00:33:14] on our kind of near term road that I think are really just kind of logical extensions and enhancements
[00:33:21] to what we're doing today. So I was starting to describe this concept of kind of market share analysis
[00:33:26] and whatnot. So we're going to do it really a lot deeper in that section. I think that's going to
[00:33:30] be really helpful to try to really put some of the statistics that I was saying at my finger tips.
[00:33:35] Right. So what types of agents are actually moving now? How does the rate of agents moving this year
[00:33:40] compared to last year? That's helpful as a as a team leader as an agent, I try to understand,
[00:33:44] oh, I didn't realize so many other people were moving just because in my office, nothing happened.
[00:33:48] It's good for me to have that type of understanding. I think the second component is to be, again,
[00:33:53] create more of a guided experience around coaching. So a lot of the ways that we look at agents today are
[00:33:59] either from a recruiting or retention perspective on on courted. But how about in between?
[00:34:04] Right. We're just we're coaching a happy agent. Right. And so I think this concept of a scorecard
[00:34:11] where you can almost get a grade of different types of things that you're doing in your business. So
[00:34:16] sure, sales volume is something that everyone cares about, but but something as simple as,
[00:34:21] you know, how are we doing specifically versus peers on some of these quality of sales metrics.
[00:34:27] Right. So we did really well on our speed to close, but our closing price relative to the
[00:34:32] list price was something that could have been improved on relative to others or even questions
[00:34:36] that team leads who are using the system can ask of their team members to try to encourage them to
[00:34:43] kind of get to the next level of their business. And so a number of kind of coaching related
[00:34:47] pieces, I think are, you know, forthcoming in the near future as well. So but I think what's exciting
[00:34:54] for us is we leave a lot of capacity in our future plans open because DJ as you use the platform,
[00:35:02] you have ideas of things that you want us to build. And so we actually deeply listened. So
[00:35:06] I think we've heard from some of our customers that, you know, and they work with some with some
[00:35:10] companies. It's kind of wishing that the customer doesn't say anything to them in terms of changing
[00:35:15] something because that's annoying because they're going to have to go build something else. But we
[00:35:19] actually really kind of fascinated by really what is your workflow today outside of our system.
[00:35:25] So most of our customers, you know, they're not using the system before they, for they, you know,
[00:35:29] maybe any system before they they work with us. So we're literally sitting with them, watching them,
[00:35:35] take a list, they look at Instagram and they see an interesting listing and then they're sending
[00:35:39] a DM and then they're writing something down on a piece of paper. So we're trying to kind of take
[00:35:43] that whole experience that's across your pen and your paper and multiple systems and kind of put
[00:35:48] it all in one place, you can say a bunch of time. So that that research is very much ongoing. So there's
[00:35:53] a whole bunch of stuff. I'm curious to if there's a social media component that could be utilized for
[00:36:00] predictive for migration for agents moving. For example, we know agents do a lot of marketing on social,
[00:36:07] obviously, as a probably their biggest place that they market themselves to find clients. I'm curious
[00:36:13] if an increase in posting or a decrease in the rate of posting content or certain types of content
[00:36:20] video versus images and again, frequency of it and I'm wondering if there is a way over time to
[00:36:28] ultimately evaluate someone's social media profiles. Again, understand, you know, if you're able to
[00:36:33] connect to those and then be able to use that to further predict whether somebody may move or not.
[00:36:38] I suspect that's on the horizon as well. It's really interesting, right? So there are
[00:36:46] increasingly, increasing number of interesting data sets that are available. So if I gave you
[00:36:53] the example of, if I could see that one of my agents on my team was Googling another team or
[00:36:58] Googling another brokerage, wouldn't that be interesting? And I think what's interesting about
[00:37:04] that example is I'll get technical here for a second. In order for us to run our predictive models,
[00:37:10] we need what's called longitudinally consistent data over time. So we need for the entire time that
[00:37:16] we're looking at these 20 years, we're running these models, we need to have this input consistently
[00:37:21] going backwards that they Googled back in 2017 and they didn't move and that's what we used to train
[00:37:27] the models. So that type of thing is interesting but really hard to do from our perspective,
[00:37:34] but the spirit of what you're asking about can actually be measured in analyst data.
[00:37:39] So for example, someone on your team has an expired transaction because they're holding back
[00:37:43] a listing because they're planning to move that we can observe and that we can we can pick up
[00:37:48] in real time. So there's, you know, number of active listings going from five to three to one to
[00:37:53] zero, that we that whole, any point in that journey, we can see that too and compare that to
[00:37:59] what they were doing in a different time period. So the, it's trying not to have to be a copat,
[00:38:05] but I guess by one point here is, MLOS data is exceptionally powerful if you know how to use it.
[00:38:13] And there's, there's a lot of different, they may not be exact fields in the MLOS, but there's
[00:38:17] different things that you can kind of extrapolate from the data if you can kind of work your way
[00:38:24] through it. And what I would say is no team lead should ever need to do it. You should work with
[00:38:29] a vendor, whether it's also someone else who kind of makes sense of that for you and get you to
[00:38:33] that point again where you're just in that meeting where it's that face-to-face meeting where you're
[00:38:37] you're probably with a client or you're with an agent who can get you even more than one client.
[00:38:42] And that's really what it's all about. Yeah, it's really neat and right now, I, you guys do give sort
[00:38:47] of a grades on on an agent's sort of prediction of whether they will move. And I, for example, I,
[00:38:54] it does something emotionally or psychologically to the recruiter as well that I think is really
[00:38:59] powerful. And you know, again, I'm sure not every prediction is accurate, of course, like any,
[00:39:04] any predictive analytics, but it's, it's pretty close to, I found it to be pretty accurate in all
[00:39:08] the times I've used it. And what's really cool is I get excited when I see a little prompt that
[00:39:13] comes up that says, we think this person is five times more likely to move in the next 12 months.
[00:39:19] Now, again, I don't know how they arrived at that, you know, Sean and his team and his data scientists
[00:39:24] obviously know how to figure that out. I don't care how they figured it out. I just want to know
[00:39:29] that that's the case. And then I'm going to hit that person as hard as I can because I get excited.
[00:39:34] I'm like, cool. And it really does help somebody who's recruiting to just make it again, the hard,
[00:39:42] the hard part isn't the conversation. The hard part isn't like, here's what I do for you. Here's
[00:39:47] what I, those, that's interpersonal stuff. We can all do that. The hard part is knowing who to call.
[00:39:53] And the vast majority of the time when you call agents, because we used to do this too, we just
[00:39:57] cold call everybody. And we had cold callers. And it was very expensive, very time consuming.
[00:40:01] And nobody really wants a cold call. I mean, nobody really wants that anyway. So this gives people
[00:40:06] a reason to reach out and say, Hey, you know, yeah, I want to recruit you. But even if you're not
[00:40:10] interested in moving, here's what I noticed about you. And I just wanted to let you know, I got my
[00:40:14] eye on you. This is super cool. I'm going to keep tracking this. And I hope one day you are ready
[00:40:19] to move because you're exactly who we want. Even if you're just doing that, remember, teams don't move
[00:40:25] all that easily individuals within teams don't move all that easily. It takes time. I've been doing
[00:40:30] this 14 years. I know how long it can take to recruit somebody. If you can build a relationship
[00:40:36] starting, you know, from a really cool data, data point from a data set that Sean and his team
[00:40:41] can provide, that this person didn't even know was their own data point. You're giving them
[00:40:46] a superlative and almost like an award that they didn't even know they won. You're saying, Hey,
[00:40:50] did you know you do this? That's really cool. Hey, I know you probably don't want to move right
[00:40:54] now, but I want you to move to us someday. So I'm going to stay on top of it. I want to build a
[00:40:59] relationship with you because you're exactly why I want. And again, you know, you'll say it in
[00:41:02] whatever way makes sense for you, but just knowing that you don't have to find those people.
[00:41:08] Sean and his team can find those people. I can't tell. And again, who's most likely on my team
[00:41:13] or my brokerage to leave? Right? You got to know that. And or there really wasn't a solution that
[00:41:19] did that up until this. There were solutions that could easily, it could look at very simple
[00:41:24] data sets. Well, production's going down. So I guess that person might might be leaving or that
[00:41:29] production's going up. So they might leave. But it wasn't very sophisticated. It wasn't comprehensive
[00:41:34] data. It was just based on like, well, yeah, if I see Google analytics for the people who visit my
[00:41:40] website going up, well, I mean, it's a good thing. But you go so far beyond that to say, here's what
[00:41:44] we think this means. And here's what we think you should do as an action step. And I can't even tell
[00:41:50] you how brilliant this is. It's amazing. I've probably been gushing over this for so long because
[00:41:57] this is exactly what I've been needing. And by the way, everybody who is on a team is a recruiter.
[00:42:04] You are recruiting constantly and you want something like this. Because if you can find the, especially
[00:42:09] if you can find these diamonds and the rough, that's another thing that Sean's team can find is
[00:42:13] these up and coming superstars. They for like, keep your eye on this person. So these especially
[00:42:18] like these part timers who are like really doing some big things, we can, you know, we can sort of
[00:42:23] see that probably a part timer, but they're right on the precipice and I can help get them over
[00:42:27] that edge. And that's another good reason to reach out. And Sean's team finds all this stuff for
[00:42:32] you. It is so cool. Yeah, I know. Thank you, DJ. I think I think whether it's recruiting or,
[00:42:39] you know, people often say, re-recruiting your agents every day, right? So it's like, it's a
[00:42:44] competitive market. So really, if you're an agent, know that three out of, you know, one out of four
[00:42:51] of your peers to your left and right are potentially leaving and considering many more than that,
[00:42:56] considering going in the next 12 months for team leads that aren't planning on recruiting.
[00:43:02] It would be wise to at least assume that a quarter of your team is going to depart in the next 12
[00:43:08] months. And then for a brokerage, obviously, that the same holds. And so I think it's an interesting
[00:43:14] time, right? Because the market's currently depressed. And I think the depressed market, the extended
[00:43:20] depression of the market has resulted obviously in frustration and inability to pay bills. And
[00:43:26] all of these other kind of challenging things in the industry. And so I think it's this time now
[00:43:31] where we're, we can see it in the data where people are actually kind of taking an action now,
[00:43:37] right? They're saying, okay, I'm, it's time for a reset. It's time to go to a place that I feel
[00:43:43] better supported or a team where I can get more resources and whatnot. And I think, you know,
[00:43:48] from the perspective of the team, that's maybe looking to start doing this for the first time.
[00:43:54] Or you're about to form a team. I think I encourage you not only to look at your peers who have
[00:44:01] just recruited brand new people into the industry or kind of moved someone from an assistant to a
[00:44:05] to a team, you know, to a producing agent role, but also to know that with some of this new
[00:44:11] technology, you can essentially have some of the tools that the top brokerages have access to.
[00:44:17] They're using it to find you. We can now give it to you to so that to almost levels the playing field
[00:44:23] out of fraction of the cost that it would take to hire a recruiter or build out the self or yourself
[00:44:29] would cost millions of dollars, right? So, you know, for, you know, relatively inexpensive. And the
[00:44:33] payback period is two to four weeks usually recruiting one agent can do can do a, a profitable,
[00:44:39] a two million dollar producer, a three million dollar producers already producing. That doesn't
[00:44:43] need to be as hard as it used to be. And just doing that alone can really change the business can
[00:44:48] actually help you in terms of your financials over the next two to three months versus something
[00:44:55] that you feel like. I'm going to wait for the market to turn back and then I'm going to focus on this.
[00:45:01] And then I'm going to do that. Well, at that point, a number of your competitors might have
[00:45:04] actually gone through that process and actually scooped up some of that emerging talent or rising
[00:45:09] stars as you're talking about. And I think it's a really recruiting can be a really good hedge
[00:45:14] against the slow market. And I think innovative teams are thinking about it. Yeah, no, you're so
[00:45:21] right. Now is the time to recruit because everyone's got a little bit more extra spare time in
[00:45:27] their day. Even top producers are busy, but they're not as busy maybe as they would be in other
[00:45:34] years. So now, you know, this is the time when when producers start looking at things like,
[00:45:40] what am I spending right now with my brokerage? What are the tools that I'm paying for out of pocket?
[00:45:44] You know, how is my and they're getting these recruiting calls, right? So this is exactly why
[00:45:50] you need a tool like this because right now it's it's kind of like this is the feast time with
[00:45:56] the feast of famine, sort of a matrix like now is feast because everything's a little depressed.
[00:46:03] People are a little depressed and now is a time to say, hey, tell me your biggest problem right now
[00:46:08] and I want to see if I can help you solve it, right? And that's essentially what a recruiting call is.
[00:46:12] As Sean said, the brokerage just isn't that important, right? It's the individual is always the
[00:46:17] most important component of it, but of course the brokerage needs those individuals to join that
[00:46:22] brokerage. And so you need to know who to reach out to when and that's exactly what this tells you.
[00:46:27] And I'm really excited because I'm curious if you'll ever create a B2C component where it would
[00:46:35] be for agents to use for their clients, right? Those predictive models of, hey, you should reach
[00:46:40] out to this client from seven years ago because they're probably ready to move. Obviously,
[00:46:45] tools like that are coming. They probably already exist to some extent, but this tool too for
[00:46:49] for me to be broker to broker or agent to agent has not yet entered the market except for you.
[00:46:55] And it is so cool. And we know that the solution really to broker a brokerage's success is agent
[00:47:03] headcount. It just is and retaining the headcount that you have. So that's why brokerage is
[00:47:09] are always recruiting. It's not a mystery. And margins are so slim right now at brokerages that
[00:47:16] it's becoming a bit of a feeding frenzy. So right now is the time to take advantage of the fact
[00:47:22] that use a system like courted that's going to tell you data that the other firms don't even know
[00:47:27] about their own agents. So they they won't even they'll be a little bit one step behind. And by the
[00:47:33] way, I'm in I have a very close friend. I won't say their name who is one of the very top producers
[00:47:39] here in the Chicago and area out of forty six thousand REALTORS that we have in the entire
[00:47:43] Chicago and area. We're talking top 10 person. And I asked this person, how often do you get recruited?
[00:47:50] And this person said, I get recruited all the time. I said, okay, how often does your own brokerage
[00:47:56] to which this person is one of the top agents at their brokerage, of course, as well?
[00:48:00] How often is your broker? Did you know top producer that you have this statistic and I pulled it
[00:48:06] from courted and this agents, I'm just I don't want to give a gender or anything. So I'm being very
[00:48:10] deliberate. Now I'm saying this, this person said, wow, can you send me a screenshot of that? I had no
[00:48:15] idea. Now this person's not going to join our firm. It wouldn't be a fit as much as I'd love to
[00:48:20] have this person. But I was like, wow, their own brokerage isn't even telling them about this.
[00:48:26] And this gives you a great foot in the door. Yeah, I think I was sitting with the team lead
[00:48:31] and Boulder two weeks ago. And I was kind of sharing her the platform. And the first thing she did
[00:48:37] was actually pull up the person that she competes with head to head on the listing presentations.
[00:48:41] And then she saw a difference in their in their statistics head to head. And it was like, I'm
[00:48:47] going to use this the next time I go head to head against against this person with the seller and
[00:48:50] Boulder, which was an unintended use of the platform, but makes it, you know, makes makes total sense.
[00:48:57] So yeah, I think, you know, one thing you mentioned was kind of using these predictive analytics and
[00:49:02] other things like that in other in other areas. I think even though this soul might sound
[00:49:10] complicated, I'm sure your customers are using this today. So if anyone goes to the
[00:49:15] Zestimate, it's the same type of technology applied to home prices. And so I and I've seen
[00:49:21] brokerages develop the likelihood to sell models in house. And I've seen some vendors doing it as
[00:49:26] well. My advice to anybody here's thinking about working with a company that is purporting
[00:49:32] including courted to to have these predictive analytics. Make sure you ask them to show the
[00:49:37] results of the model. If they if a company cannot show it's through a process called backtesting
[00:49:44] where they actually say how accurate were we last year, I predicting last year with all the
[00:49:50] all the data leading up until that year. If they can't show you that, I would walk away because
[00:49:55] many of these technologies and the applications of them are in their infancy. I can tell you
[00:50:01] that you've seen it. But I would kind of push the vendor to be very clear on exactly how
[00:50:11] accurate they're all. Otherwise, maybe that's not the right time or maybe not the right group to go in.
[00:50:16] So that's my one kind of buyer beware kind of caveat for as a practitioner in the space. We're
[00:50:23] very proud of our results, but I encourage everyone to ask specifically what the results are before
[00:50:28] they spend a lot of money on something that they may or may not be. I love that. That's
[00:50:32] absolutely. We should we should demand that from our vendors and from our brokerages. Now is the
[00:50:37] time to really ask, hey, what tools are you providing? And again, this is something that you can
[00:50:43] also bring to your managing broker. If you want to stay at your brokerage and you want to help
[00:50:48] that brokerage succeed, introduce this tool to them because this is probably what your managing
[00:50:53] broker needs to recruit more agents like you. And it will actually help you along the way if you're
[00:50:58] able to help the success of the brokerage. But of course, if you want to build a team, this is perfect
[00:51:02] for that. If you want to keep your team, this is perfect. Or even if you are a recruiter of sorts
[00:51:08] managing broker, for example, and you need some help because you're already doing 25 other things
[00:51:13] in a given day, but you have to hit some sort of quota. And that is really, really exciting stuff.
[00:51:22] So Sean, I wanted to thank you for coming on our show. It's courted is the product. I want
[00:51:29] everybody to check out courted at courted.io. You can reach out to Sean and his sales team.
[00:51:36] And they will give you a demo and you can take a look and see what I've been playing around with
[00:51:41] and boy is it powerful. It's really neat stuff. And they are at the forefront of this. And it's
[00:51:46] only going to get more and more integrated with other data sets. And it's going to even get
[00:51:54] more predictive and better along the way. But right now as it is, unbelievable. So I want to have
[00:52:00] everyone go to courted.io learn about the the system, see if it would be a good fit for you.
[00:52:06] Sean, on behalf of our audience, I thank you for coming on today. This was very exciting for me.
[00:52:11] Just to talk to somebody, something like this together. It's so cool. And I see only huge things
[00:52:17] obviously for your company going forward. On behalf of Sean and myself, I want to thank
[00:52:21] everybody for sending us or for sticking around to the end. We appreciate it. We appreciate you.

[00:52:33] broker. They need to hear this. So shoot it over to them. We'd appreciate that. And I as always
[00:52:38] let us know what you think of the show. We are always trying to improve ourselves to make this
[00:52:42] better for you. All right, Sean, thank you so much. We will see everybody on the next episode.
[00:52:49] Thanks, TJ. Really appreciate the time and enjoy the conversation.

Today on the show we have Sean Sotistrum from corded.io which is a recruiting and retention platform for agents, brokerages and teams. Let me tell you more about Sean. Now Sean is the co founder and CEO of accorded which provides brokerages and teams with recruiting retention and coaching software. Now prior to accorded Sean was an associate partner and the co lead from a Kinseyan company's residential real estate practice in North America where he advised leading brokerages, online listing portals and software companies. Prior to that Sean joined urban Compass which is now known as Compass where he was there when there was only 30 employees at the company and he built and led the expansion and growth function for the company launching and managing compasses first 40 offices outside of New York and we've all seen what has happened with Compass over the years. And Sean please everybody visit corded at courtd.io. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. I have been testing this piece of software. It's one of the most incredible things I've seen in 14 years of working in this industry. So Sean welcome to keeping it real. DJ thanks so much for having me on and and protesting out corded. I really appreciate the opportunity to chat with you this afternoon. Yeah let's talk about and by the way your background is really impressive. For those that don't know, McKinsey is widely respected as one of the top white glove consulting agencies in the world. They have their reputation is is beyond reproach as well as of course working with Compass and you help them expand and really start to grow their brand and now they feel like feels like they've taken over the whole country. It's just incredible. Even though technically we're a competitor of theirs in a sense, I've been nothing but in by everybody I know who works in McKinsey and everybody I know that works at Compass. So you've come from some some good stock there and I love your new tool because I rarely ever have tech partners on our show because I oftentimes I'm really just not that impressed quite honestly with a lot of tools. Of course there are tools I like but yours is really something unique and different. So before we get to corded, tell us about your background. Tell us how you got started in real estate. Yeah thanks for that very warm introduction. So yeah, as you mentioned, I started my career at McKinsey and for me graduating from college actually in Chicago, I didn't know exactly what I wanted to do. So I figured if I got the opportunity to work in a few different industries with companies and maybe test out things from strategy to operations to some more technology related projects, then I'd maybe get a better sense of what I wanted to do. And I think one of the fun things after that, you know, I spent about three years there and then I had the opportunity, I had the opportunity to go meet Robert Reffkin over at Compass. And you know if anyone's nothing as met him, he's a very convincing guy and he's got a big vision about things that he wants to do and the way that he sees the world. I think it was 36 hours later, I was working for him at urban Compass now Compass. And so it was a really, really fun experience for me. I learned a lot. There were some exceptionally talented people that I got to work alongside. And yeah, even the first week was really funny there. I can talk about it for a minute. The way he recruited me was he said, Sean, you know, I know you're coming from the structured job at McKinsey, he had had that job as well himself a few years before. And he said, the first thing that you're going to do on your first day is write the job description for yourself in the company. And I was like, that sounds amazing. I'm coming from this super organized, super structured company where we're giving people advice and helping them with things. I get to write my own job description, that sounds amazing. So I jumped in, I started doing that in the first morning and I came up with leading national expansion and growth of the company. And he looked at me and he's like, you know, we have no market share in New York. And we're just getting started. And we're not even close to expanding this business. And I don't even know what you'd be figuring out. This sounds like a good job description for a few years from now. I said, bro, but you know, give me a few minutes to like put it all together. And a few months later, we had expanded into DC. And then, you know, we obviously had a number of new markets off to that. So that was a really fun experience getting to get it, you know, really, that was my first experience in residential real estate. And I was fascinated by the opportunity and also so many that, you know, that I encountered and that we were trying to solve a Compass, some well and some still probably need to be figured out. And then I actually went back to McKinsey after that and helped to start build out their real estate practice and had the chance to work with some really fantastic brokerages, developers, had the opportunity to work with private equity firms that were looking at tech companies in the real estate space. So I could kind of take a look at the landscape from a few different angles and vantage points, which was really helpful and just, you know, I think has informed a lot of my perspectives today. Yeah, it's really, it's really interesting. So your background really wasn't so much in real estate until you got to the Compass side and then back to McKinsey. And it's interesting that you saw this opportunity to create a new piece of software that really really didn't exist. And I know it didn't exist because I have been searching for a tool like this personally for my own work here at Kale Realty for since 2011. And there are a few solutions out there, but they don't really do what courted does. And I think this is, I was telling Sean, he already knows this, but I was telling him how I think this is so well positioned at the, really where we are presently in the timeline of REALTOR stuff because obviously things are changing in NAR. We're starting to see some concerns about things like buyer commissions and agents having to understand how to express their value proposition and get paid a little bit in a different way possibly. And we're seeing a lot of flight to teams. We're seeing a lot of flight all over the place. I know that you guys keep really close tabs on migration when it comes to agents moving brokerages. And I know last year was a huge year for movement. And I know that because I saw that as well here at R firm and to have a tool that actually really does give somebody like me. Now, I have a unique position. So I know this can be a little bit of a disconnect for our audience. I want to reconnect everybody. So I know people listening are probably not recruiters, but are you thinking about either building a team or joining a team or you already have a team and you want to keep the people you have on it? This is a tool that is really designed to do all of that. And I have not seen any real leaps forward in the technology in the last 10 years or so. And then Sean came along and said you should check this out. And boy was I blown away. So tell us about Corden. Yes. So much of the inspiration for the platform, I think comes from the series of experiences that my self and some of our co-founders have as well. So I think in my seat at Compass, we're obviously tasked with wanting to grow the business. And I think as we look at just some of the dynamics in the space, you have, we're on track to see about 25% of productive agents. So agents who have done at least one deal in the last 12 months move between brokerages this year. And that number was about 17 and a half percent last year. This data is relatively hard to track down. So we just think about that. One in four agents moving is significant, right? It's a significant amount of turnover. And so when we think about that, then obviously, most agents would say, I'm the one paying the brokerage and I agree with that. And so as a result, the agents obviously make a very, typically a very large portion of the commissions that are earned. And so agents are really important to the brokerages. And as a result, and of course, agents are the folks that formulate into teams, inform into teams. And so for me, in this industry, I still believe it's all about the agent, regardless of what happens with settlements and other things in the future. It's a very personal experience and the agent has so much leverage. It's great for agents to understand that, right? And realize that brokerage or team should be lucky to have you, right? And in that respect, it's this interesting dynamic in this industry where usually the brokerage of the team doesn't just gather applications and then sort through them. There's actually an opportunity to hunt, right? To actually go through and identify who meets my criteria and then go through a process and then hopefully bring someone on. And my, you know, back to your question, I think part of the reason to start the platform is that process of hunting, that process of building the team with the right people, to me, that's always felt very time consuming and very expensive. And I do believe that there's an opportunity to use the data that's available in the industry, right? People often talk about how much data that is available. But I think a technology company that's working for you should make sense of it and should really put you in a position where you can make those decisions, good decisions and also make those decisions quickly. And so that's really how we try to orient the platform to be helpful. And we do have many teams that use the platform for a variety of brokerages, from brokerages where the teams themselves are incentivized to get other people to join the teams, to very traditional teams with three or four agents or maybe a solo practitioner who's looking to recruit their first agent and they want that person to actually be profitable and help them in the first three months from a financial perspective, not just someone who's going to take a bunch of time to get ramped up and learn the business at the new team. And so we can observe across the space, but yeah, it's been a really fun journey so far. Yeah, and so let's talk about sort of the existing tools out there and then what you are doing that's different. So for everyone who is interested in building a team or increasing the head count at their brokerage or even just retaining who you already have, there are some tools that assist and they're usually in the form of a CRM. The CRM may be connected to MLS data. So you can basically take a look and slice and dice data and you say, oh, this person might appear that they had a bad year last year. So maybe there's a reason to reach out and see if they may want to move or they had a really good year and maybe that's a reason to reach out. And it also, these tools have been around actually for a long time, but yours goes really a step way beyond that because the data is there. It's almost like I was thinking about this with Google Analytics. So if anyone's ever set up Google Analytics on a website, it's really easy to do. It's just a little basically a little identifier you put it in and it starts tracking, but trying to make sense of Google Analytics data is actually somewhat complicated and at least in my opinion. And you really almost need somebody who understands Google Analytics data and say, here's what all this really means. Here are some action steps. Google Analytics, maybe one day it'll get there and it'll tell you you should really do this and this, but doesn't really do that yet. Your system does a couple of things. First of all, I want to say, there's so many cool things about this tool. It's going to sound like I'm doing a commercial for it, but I am so impressed with this. I've wanted something like this. First of all, what it can do is you as the brokerage or the team, you can literally go in and say, here are all the things I offer for my agents. Here's what I do for splits. Here are the awards we've won. Here's how we train. Here's our marketing we do, the tools, etc. You can literally tell, courted. Here's all the stuff we do. By the way, courted also can scan your recruiting website and pull all sorts of information and it will do that anyway. And then on top of that, you can feed it information about, here's what we offer. Here's our value proposition. So in doing that, then what it does is courted, again, does have access to this MLS data, but it goes a step beyond just saying, hey, this is this person's production. Here's what they did in the last year, which is what other tools have done. It actually interprets the data and then gives you an action step. So what will literally tell you, I'll give you a great example. One of the ways that this system works is it looks at people who have left your firm or maybe your team. If someone who was a good producer and they've left, well, you hopefully would want to get them back someday if you want them to come back. And this tool gives you a reason to reach out to somebody who's maybe left your firm. And it says, hey, you should reach out to this person. They, Sean and his team called these boomerang agents. These are agents that Sean and his team have decided based on various data points that this person is probably poised to move. And so I actually used that a lot this week. I reached out to a bunch of agents that had left us over the last several years. And I was, and I had reasons to reach out to them. Not just, hey, we want you back because we send those out anyway. I send that out every quarter. Hey, I want you back. But now I was like, hey, I want you back. And congratulations. You're up 54% from last year. That's incredible. And so anyway, that's just one of the, one of the cool features. But this idea of indicators of interest or indicators of movement, you guys have that magic formula that you're continually refining based on all these different signals. And you're basically telling us, it's basically like a CRM that tells you what to do when. Is essentially the way I think about it. Yeah, so I think I just reflect on my own experience, right? Where over the course of a few years, my team and I have recruited about 1,500 agents to a company. And when we looked at that, conversion rates were still something that we were working on, right? They were relatively low, right? And we were looking at that and we were kind of thinking about a few things. One is the agents who are more lower on the production spectrum or kind of emerging agents tend to move more. And then the agents who are more established tend to move less. So in the one to five million dollar segment, close to one in five agents move between companies every year. In the $50 million plus segment, only one in 20 agents are moving between firms every year. So that's just one just kind of data point. I think the other component that we started to pay attention to was not every agent every day is as likely to move as another day. And so at the individual agent level, it can be really hard to identify for whom it's the right time for them to hear from you, right? So we can now start to not think about what's easy for me, the team lead, but what's good for the candidate hearing for me, right? So in terms of the right time. And then as you mentioned, there's another kind of aspect to this, which is, so what do I say now? Do I send ever on the same trick campaign? And we've inserted their name and so we think it's personalized. Or can we go a step beyond that? And I think what's interesting now is that as we said, there's so much data available in the industry and technology has advanced so much over the last even just two or three years that we can start to formulate really personalized messages in seconds and they can actually be generated for you that are highly specific. That follow all of the best practices a coach would tell you, right? So a coach would say, you know, be specific, show that you've done your homework, talk about your connection to them if you have one. Then you have the right, maybe to talk about the company. And so we can actually create those for you in a way that helps you save a lot of time. And so we think of, we think of this as kind of precision targeting, but doing it really quickly. And then the other aspect to it that you're alluding to is there's a very strong predictive analytics and data science component to what we do. And so these terms are complicated and they all branches of AI, but we actually interact with them all the time. So when Netflix recommends another action movie from the 80s, that's an example of Netflix helping you to get to the point where you can watch a movie quickly, right? It's not always the perfect recommendation, but oftentimes you'll just click on it and start watching. And so that's an example of the core to candidates where we will kind of start to understand different types of segments that are good for you and that you interact with them and recommend more agents like that in the interest of not having analysis paralysis, but in the interest of you having five minutes and still being able to try to reach out to somebody in five minutes or less. And I think the other element to it is, I think, again, reflect on my own experience. It was really hard for me to understand based on historical production, whether a five million dollar producer or a 20 million dollar producer had just had the best year of their career or their best years were in front of them. The only way I really felt like I could understand that was by meeting them and having a personal relationship. But it's really hard to have a personal relationship with 25,000 agents in Chicago, right? And so how do you go from that long list down to the people who you should even call today? So this is a process where we use a very kind of deep, deep data analysis where we essentially reconstruct every single agent over the course of their career and we start to compare not only their production changes to relative to themselves, but we start to look at things like quality of sales metrics. So close to list price ratio and price for square foot and days on market and compare it to other agents who sell similar homes at the same time. And then we look at quality of sales metrics. Like, are you selling high floor in the apartment? What is your interior lot square footed interior square footage ratio to the lot square footage to try to understand the types of homes that you're selling? And then even office dynamics. So any agent listening that's been unfortunately through a process where your loved manager has turned over after 10 years and the three top agents just left your office, that creates a question at least for yourself. Is this still the right place for me? And so we measured those dynamics in real time as well. And those are all formulated into predictions of sales volume and predictions of folks being likely to potentially leave their firm, which can help a team lead to really kind of narrow in on who are the five people I should actually speak to today because I have just a few minutes. Yeah, boy, you said so much and I really love the fact that I can look at a candidate in courted and you have predicted what their next 12 months is going to look like. I can see all of their production pretty much through their entire career, the data that you have. But the most important thing again is that what do we think they're going to do next year? And that isn't something that I would easily be able to, I wouldn't be able to do it in the way that you have you guys have all these data points that are used, you know, into reference, for example, like the Netflix example Netflix is a self-correcting system. So it sends you, so is Google and many other pieces of software that are self-correcting. So they predict then they then they they correct, right? And so what I love is that you have all of these data points that are able to do what I just, I'm not able to, not only to determine who might be wanting to move and who's going to have a next couple of great years in front of them that maybe their own managing broker, their own team doesn't see in them. Maybe because again, they just don't have these predictive analytics. And also who might be leaving my company, even though everything on on the surface looks great, they're had a great year, everything looks good and all of a sudden there's a like a warning in courted, hey, this person might might be considering moving. Well, and if we think like how would courted know that? Well, this is just all database. There's that famous story that probably everyone has has read or heard about with Target being able to predict pregnancy before the person even knows their pregnant. And that's not just a cute story. It actually is true. Their predictive analytics are so strong that there was a story of a woman who didn't even know she was pregnant, starting to get pregnancy coupons in the mail from Target, because Target figured it out before she even knew. And that's how smart this data can be and how predictive and how accurate it can be. So I love that you're taking some of what what consumer, you know, retail consumer big box stores have had for years, groceries have it and big retailers have it, but bringing that to the real estate space. It is it is remarkable. And I if nothing else, if you're like, well, I don't want to recruit, you definitely want to retain. So if you're not recruiting, you got to and well, you should do both. But this is a tool, even if you're not looking to grow, you just want to keep your your your your people happy. And yes, personal relationships, of course, are going to ultimately win the day. But this is going to tell you who Sean and his team think maybe considering a move and you can and you can then begin to give that person more individual attention and hopefully change it so that that if they have that urge that that urge is is quashed. I think you just said it again, right? It connects to to my point earlier about this being an industry that's really built around agents. It's really also built around relationships, right? So we're talking about relatively complicated technology. But at the end of the day, the application is very simple. And the what the intent here is as a team lead from a recruiting perspective, what your best at is probably sitting face to face with the potential candidate and talking to them about how their business is going to change and their career is going to change when they join my team, right? What we are attempting to do is take the guesswork of figuring out who's the right fit and what's the right time and what do I say to them in order to get them into that meeting. We kind of will handle a lot of that for you so that you can spend more time maximizing your time in that recruiting session. Or as you said from a retention perspective, yes, we do identify vulnerability in a team or in a brokerage, but it's also so much information in one place that's relatively easily digestible. At least we've tried to make it so that your conversation doesn't need to start with how's it going unless you want to unless you want to start that way. It can start with, hey, DJ, congrats on six closes on the list side last year. You're your days on market. It was 15 days and your 100 and your close list price ratio was 103%, which is way higher than people who sell the similar homes in Skokie, Illinois. Tell me about your approach to pricing and the only thing I'm going to try to help you with is how do we elevate that price point a little bit because you're doing a fantastic job. And so we can elevate the conversation, but it doesn't take any more time. In fact, it should take less time to start that conversation, but it's still about your relationship with your own nature. So there's no AI, you know, talking on the half review or doing anything crazy like that. It's really just how do we how do we kind of make sense of the data that's available and kind of bring it to your needs. Yeah, I'll tell you exactly what this the the itch that this scratch the scratch that this is to say the expression right. This scratch is an itch for me and I'll tell you exactly what it is. I have been waiting and I'm sure this will come very shortly, but it isn't quite here yet with AI. I am waiting for the day that we have a personal assistant that every we wake up in the morning and it's like, Hey, I looked at calendar. I looked at your to do's. It's connected with, you know, all of my different software solutions. You're going to do this first. You're going to do this second. Here's what your day looks like and oh, by the way, remember to pick up this on the way home and it's coming. It's going to happen all the to do systems. I'm sure are working on that. It's not here yet, but you've actually built kind of that already, which is really cool because what I can do is I can log in and I can get a prompt to like Sean, you were saying, it is time consuming to look up someone's production. It is time consuming to look up, you know, different data points that and then try to make sense of it. I log in to court it and it literally shows me right to my face, call this person for this reason, say this. It even gives me prompts on what to say or what to email. If you want to email, you can you can text as well. But it actually again, it knows all about your firm because you've given it this information. It starts to formulate a argument or a persuasive reason to maybe reach out. And what Sean said is really cool because there's so many cool data points in here that when I'm doing a recruiting call, people typically know their production. They know about what they've sold in the number of units, but they don't know, a lot of times they don't know like days on market compared to other people or that it's sold for higher, you know, over asking than, then, you know, other homes that have been sold recently. And what I can do when I have that conversation is say, hey, just out of curiosity, I don't know if you knew this, but you're actually selling homes 10% faster than everybody in your market. How are you, and what Sean says is, there's two ways to go with that. You can just be like, that's amazing. We want to have somebody who can do that on our team. You're amazing. But you could also use it as a conversation starter. Like, God, I'd love to know how you do that. And that is one of the most flattering things you could ever say. And again, think about not recruiting, but retention, knowing this about your own agents, going, God, I'm so proud you're on our team. You sell things 10% faster. How are you doing that? Imagine what that would do to somebody's feeling of connection to their own brokerage. Right? Now, are their own managing brokers doing that? Probably not. So you need a tool like this to keep the people because guys like me are going to come along and call those agents and be like, did you know this? And they're going to say, I didn't even know that myself. Nobody at my firm told me. So these are these are the reasons and you and I can't tell you how time consuming it used to be to even find any bit of this data and then research it, reach out, you're right. It was a time killer. So this is it. And I will say this too for any teams that are listening. I know a lot of teams here in Chicago, we have a lot of teams at our firm as well. I am, I am really immersed in the in in teams just because it's so commonplace. And the top teams always have the same biggest complaint. It's so hard to recruit. That's what every top team tells me. They're like, it's hard to get good people. This is a tool that will just allow allow that to happen much more simply. And if you're a brokerage where the managing broker is doing recruiting, I'm not the managing broker. I get to recruit all day. Most most firms don't have somebody like me. So they're doing a lot of different things, keeping the business running, making sure compliance is in place, doing all of the other hats that they have to wear. This allows them to literally log in and they don't have to think about it. They just click on somebody that they either want to recruit or retain and they have reasons to reach out and courted prompts you. It's so cool. It tells you exactly what they might suggest as a prompt to have a conversation. Yeah, I think there's another kind of dynamic here, right? Which is, I'm often I'm an avid consumer of real estate news, right? So I'm on these different websites, many times a day trying to understand what's happening. And I found that that only told me one small part of the market, right? There was a few firms that tend to get covered a lot in the news and that's kind of the only ones that I really was kind of learning about. And then when we had the system, we decided to also build a view of the brokerages and of the teams. And so we could start to understand in Chicago, which are the teams that are growing faster than the other ones, which are the brokerages that in the last month lost the most agents, or gained the most agents. And so some of this kind of migration analysis, but specifically thinking about it from a team and brokerage perspective, I think is, it's just really helpful in terms of making a decision about where you want to end up, or who do you want to attach to in the long run, right? And so I think that information can be powerful. And I think that the idea, though, of our platform, or that the intent, right, is to try to have a guided experience so that it's not kind of create your own adventure. Of course, you can if you want to, but the idea is to try to bring you what you need when you need it, such that you can save time and get back to selling real estate or get back to all the hundred other things that you need to do that are not recruiting and retention. And so it's hopefully a kind of saving time through that. Yeah, it's amazing. And just to wet our appetites on any any future features or benefits are, and I don't know what you're able to share, what gives kept under wraps, but whatever you're able to share, where do you see the evolution of courted going in the future? Yeah, so there's a whole bunch of things that we have on our kind of near term road that I think are really just kind of logical extensions and enhancements to what we're doing today. So I was starting to describe this concept of kind of market share analysis and whatnot. So we're going to do it really a lot deeper in that section. I think that's going to be really helpful to try to really put some of the statistics that I was saying at my finger tips. Right. So what types of agents are actually moving now? How does the rate of agents moving this year compared to last year? That's helpful as a as a team leader as an agent, I try to understand, oh, I didn't realize so many other people were moving just because in my office, nothing happened. It's good for me to have that type of understanding. I think the second component is to be, again, create more of a guided experience around coaching. So a lot of the ways that we look at agents today are either from a recruiting or retention perspective on on courted. But how about in between? Right. We're just we're coaching a happy agent. Right. And so I think this concept of a scorecard where you can almost get a grade of different types of things that you're doing in your business. So sure, sales volume is something that everyone cares about, but but something as simple as, you know, how are we doing specifically versus peers on some of these quality of sales metrics. Right. So we did really well on our speed to close, but our closing price relative to the list price was something that could have been improved on relative to others or even questions that team leads who are using the system can ask of their team members to try to encourage them to kind of get to the next level of their business. And so a number of kind of coaching related pieces, I think are, you know, forthcoming in the near future as well. So but I think what's exciting for us is we leave a lot of capacity in our future plans open because DJ as you use the platform, you have ideas of things that you want us to build. And so we actually deeply listened. So I think we've heard from some of our customers that, you know, and they work with some with some companies. It's kind of wishing that the customer doesn't say anything to them in terms of changing something because that's annoying because they're going to have to go build something else. But we actually really kind of fascinated by really what is your workflow today outside of our system. So most of our customers, you know, they're not using the system before they, for they, you know, maybe any system before they they work with us. So we're literally sitting with them, watching them, take a list, they look at Instagram and they see an interesting listing and then they're sending a DM and then they're writing something down on a piece of paper. So we're trying to kind of take that whole experience that's across your pen and your paper and multiple systems and kind of put it all in one place, you can say a bunch of time. So that that research is very much ongoing. So there's a whole bunch of stuff. I'm curious to if there's a social media component that could be utilized for predictive for migration for agents moving. For example, we know agents do a lot of marketing on social, obviously, as a probably their biggest place that they market themselves to find clients. I'm curious if an increase in posting or a decrease in the rate of posting content or certain types of content video versus images and again, frequency of it and I'm wondering if there is a way over time to ultimately evaluate someone's social media profiles. Again, understand, you know, if you're able to connect to those and then be able to use that to further predict whether somebody may move or not. I suspect that's on the horizon as well. It's really interesting, right? So there are increasingly, increasing number of interesting data sets that are available. So if I gave you the example of, if I could see that one of my agents on my team was Googling another team or Googling another brokerage, wouldn't that be interesting? And I think what's interesting about that example is I'll get technical here for a second. In order for us to run our predictive models, we need what's called longitudinally consistent data over time. So we need for the entire time that we're looking at these 20 years, we're running these models, we need to have this input consistently going backwards that they Googled back in 2017 and they didn't move and that's what we used to train the models. So that type of thing is interesting but really hard to do from our perspective, but the spirit of what you're asking about can actually be measured in analyst data. So for example, someone on your team has an expired transaction because they're holding back a listing because they're planning to move that we can observe and that we can we can pick up in real time. So there's, you know, number of active listings going from five to three to one to zero, that we that whole, any point in that journey, we can see that too and compare that to what they were doing in a different time period. So the, it's trying not to have to be a copat, but I guess by one point here is, MLOS data is exceptionally powerful if you know how to use it. And there's, there's a lot of different, they may not be exact fields in the MLOS, but there's different things that you can kind of extrapolate from the data if you can kind of work your way through it. And what I would say is no team lead should ever need to do it. You should work with a vendor, whether it's also someone else who kind of makes sense of that for you and get you to that point again where you're just in that meeting where it's that face-to-face meeting where you're you're probably with a client or you're with an agent who can get you even more than one client. And that's really what it's all about. Yeah, it's really neat and right now, I, you guys do give sort of a grades on on an agent's sort of prediction of whether they will move. And I, for example, I, it does something emotionally or psychologically to the recruiter as well that I think is really powerful. And you know, again, I'm sure not every prediction is accurate, of course, like any, any predictive analytics, but it's, it's pretty close to, I found it to be pretty accurate in all the times I've used it. And what's really cool is I get excited when I see a little prompt that comes up that says, we think this person is five times more likely to move in the next 12 months. Now, again, I don't know how they arrived at that, you know, Sean and his team and his data scientists obviously know how to figure that out. I don't care how they figured it out. I just want to know that that's the case. And then I'm going to hit that person as hard as I can because I get excited. I'm like, cool. And it really does help somebody who's recruiting to just make it again, the hard, the hard part isn't the conversation. The hard part isn't like, here's what I do for you. Here's what I, those, that's interpersonal stuff. We can all do that. The hard part is knowing who to call. And the vast majority of the time when you call agents, because we used to do this too, we just cold call everybody. And we had cold callers. And it was very expensive, very time consuming. And nobody really wants a cold call. I mean, nobody really wants that anyway. So this gives people a reason to reach out and say, Hey, you know, yeah, I want to recruit you. But even if you're not interested in moving, here's what I noticed about you. And I just wanted to let you know, I got my eye on you. This is super cool. I'm going to keep tracking this. And I hope one day you are ready to move because you're exactly who we want. Even if you're just doing that, remember, teams don't move all that easily individuals within teams don't move all that easily. It takes time. I've been doing this 14 years. I know how long it can take to recruit somebody. If you can build a relationship starting, you know, from a really cool data, data point from a data set that Sean and his team can provide, that this person didn't even know was their own data point. You're giving them a superlative and almost like an award that they didn't even know they won. You're saying, Hey, did you know you do this? That's really cool. Hey, I know you probably don't want to move right now, but I want you to move to us someday. So I'm going to stay on top of it. I want to build a relationship with you because you're exactly why I want. And again, you know, you'll say it in whatever way makes sense for you, but just knowing that you don't have to find those people. Sean and his team can find those people. I can't tell. And again, who's most likely on my team or my brokerage to leave? Right? You got to know that. And or there really wasn't a solution that did that up until this. There were solutions that could easily, it could look at very simple data sets. Well, production's going down. So I guess that person might might be leaving or that production's going up. So they might leave. But it wasn't very sophisticated. It wasn't comprehensive data. It was just based on like, well, yeah, if I see Google analytics for the people who visit my website going up, well, I mean, it's a good thing. But you go so far beyond that to say, here's what we think this means. And here's what we think you should do as an action step. And I can't even tell you how brilliant this is. It's amazing. I've probably been gushing over this for so long because this is exactly what I've been needing. And by the way, everybody who is on a team is a recruiter. You are recruiting constantly and you want something like this. Because if you can find the, especially if you can find these diamonds and the rough, that's another thing that Sean's team can find is these up and coming superstars. They for like, keep your eye on this person. So these especially like these part timers who are like really doing some big things, we can, you know, we can sort of see that probably a part timer, but they're right on the precipice and I can help get them over that edge. And that's another good reason to reach out. And Sean's team finds all this stuff for you. It is so cool. Yeah, I know. Thank you, DJ. I think I think whether it's recruiting or, you know, people often say, re-recruiting your agents every day, right? So it's like, it's a competitive market. So really, if you're an agent, know that three out of, you know, one out of four of your peers to your left and right are potentially leaving and considering many more than that, considering going in the next 12 months for team leads that aren't planning on recruiting. It would be wise to at least assume that a quarter of your team is going to depart in the next 12 months. And then for a brokerage, obviously, that the same holds. And so I think it's an interesting time, right? Because the market's currently depressed. And I think the depressed market, the extended depression of the market has resulted obviously in frustration and inability to pay bills. And all of these other kind of challenging things in the industry. And so I think it's this time now where we're, we can see it in the data where people are actually kind of taking an action now, right? They're saying, okay, I'm, it's time for a reset. It's time to go to a place that I feel better supported or a team where I can get more resources and whatnot. And I think, you know, from the perspective of the team, that's maybe looking to start doing this for the first time. Or you're about to form a team. I think I encourage you not only to look at your peers who have just recruited brand new people into the industry or kind of moved someone from an assistant to a to a team, you know, to a producing agent role, but also to know that with some of this new technology, you can essentially have some of the tools that the top brokerages have access to. They're using it to find you. We can now give it to you to so that to almost levels the playing field out of fraction of the cost that it would take to hire a recruiter or build out the self or yourself would cost millions of dollars, right? So, you know, for, you know, relatively inexpensive. And the payback period is two to four weeks usually recruiting one agent can do can do a, a profitable, a two million dollar producer, a three million dollar producers already producing. That doesn't need to be as hard as it used to be. And just doing that alone can really change the business can actually help you in terms of your financials over the next two to three months versus something that you feel like. I'm going to wait for the market to turn back and then I'm going to focus on this. And then I'm going to do that. Well, at that point, a number of your competitors might have actually gone through that process and actually scooped up some of that emerging talent or rising stars as you're talking about. And I think it's a really recruiting can be a really good hedge against the slow market. And I think innovative teams are thinking about it. Yeah, no, you're so right. Now is the time to recruit because everyone's got a little bit more extra spare time in their day. Even top producers are busy, but they're not as busy maybe as they would be in other years. So now, you know, this is the time when when producers start looking at things like, what am I spending right now with my brokerage? What are the tools that I'm paying for out of pocket? You know, how is my and they're getting these recruiting calls, right? So this is exactly why you need a tool like this because right now it's it's kind of like this is the feast time with the feast of famine, sort of a matrix like now is feast because everything's a little depressed. People are a little depressed and now is a time to say, hey, tell me your biggest problem right now and I want to see if I can help you solve it, right? And that's essentially what a recruiting call is. As Sean said, the brokerage just isn't that important, right? It's the individual is always the most important component of it, but of course the brokerage needs those individuals to join that brokerage. And so you need to know who to reach out to when and that's exactly what this tells you. And I'm really excited because I'm curious if you'll ever create a B2C component where it would be for agents to use for their clients, right? Those predictive models of, hey, you should reach out to this client from seven years ago because they're probably ready to move. Obviously, tools like that are coming. They probably already exist to some extent, but this tool too for for me to be broker to broker or agent to agent has not yet entered the market except for you. And it is so cool. And we know that the solution really to broker a brokerage's success is agent headcount. It just is and retaining the headcount that you have. So that's why brokerage is are always recruiting. It's not a mystery. And margins are so slim right now at brokerages that it's becoming a bit of a feeding frenzy. So right now is the time to take advantage of the fact that use a system like courted that's going to tell you data that the other firms don't even know about their own agents. So they they won't even they'll be a little bit one step behind. And by the way, I'm in I have a very close friend. I won't say their name who is one of the very top producers here in the Chicago and area out of forty six thousand REALTORS that we have in the entire Chicago and area. We're talking top 10 person. And I asked this person, how often do you get recruited? And this person said, I get recruited all the time. I said, okay, how often does your own brokerage to which this person is one of the top agents at their brokerage, of course, as well? How often is your broker? Did you know top producer that you have this statistic and I pulled it from courted and this agents, I'm just I don't want to give a gender or anything. So I'm being very deliberate. Now I'm saying this, this person said, wow, can you send me a screenshot of that? I had no idea. Now this person's not going to join our firm. It wouldn't be a fit as much as I'd love to have this person. But I was like, wow, their own brokerage isn't even telling them about this. And this gives you a great foot in the door. Yeah, I think I was sitting with the team lead and Boulder two weeks ago. And I was kind of sharing her the platform. And the first thing she did was actually pull up the person that she competes with head to head on the listing presentations. And then she saw a difference in their in their statistics head to head. And it was like, I'm going to use this the next time I go head to head against against this person with the seller and Boulder, which was an unintended use of the platform, but makes it, you know, makes makes total sense. So yeah, I think, you know, one thing you mentioned was kind of using these predictive analytics and other things like that in other in other areas. I think even though this soul might sound complicated, I'm sure your customers are using this today. So if anyone goes to the Zestimate, it's the same type of technology applied to home prices. And so I and I've seen brokerages develop the likelihood to sell models in house. And I've seen some vendors doing it as well. My advice to anybody here's thinking about working with a company that is purporting including courted to to have these predictive analytics. Make sure you ask them to show the results of the model. If they if a company cannot show it's through a process called backtesting where they actually say how accurate were we last year, I predicting last year with all the all the data leading up until that year. If they can't show you that, I would walk away because many of these technologies and the applications of them are in their infancy. I can tell you that you've seen it. But I would kind of push the vendor to be very clear on exactly how accurate they're all. Otherwise, maybe that's not the right time or maybe not the right group to go in. So that's my one kind of buyer beware kind of caveat for as a practitioner in the space. We're very proud of our results, but I encourage everyone to ask specifically what the results are before they spend a lot of money on something that they may or may not be. I love that. That's absolutely. We should we should demand that from our vendors and from our brokerages. Now is the time to really ask, hey, what tools are you providing? And again, this is something that you can also bring to your managing broker. If you want to stay at your brokerage and you want to help that brokerage succeed, introduce this tool to them because this is probably what your managing broker needs to recruit more agents like you. And it will actually help you along the way if you're able to help the success of the brokerage. But of course, if you want to build a team, this is perfect for that. If you want to keep your team, this is perfect. Or even if you are a recruiter of sorts managing broker, for example, and you need some help because you're already doing 25 other things in a given day, but you have to hit some sort of quota. And that is really, really exciting stuff. So Sean, I wanted to thank you for coming on our show. It's courted is the product. I want everybody to check out courted at courted.io. You can reach out to Sean and his sales team. And they will give you a demo and you can take a look and see what I've been playing around with and boy is it powerful. It's really neat stuff. And they are at the forefront of this. And it's only going to get more and more integrated with other data sets. And it's going to even get more predictive and better along the way. But right now as it is, unbelievable. So I want to have everyone go to courted.io learn about the the system, see if it would be a good fit for you.
