[00:01:17] And now, on to our show.
[00:01:33] What's up, guys?
[00:01:34] Welcome to where we are going to talk about one of the root causes
[00:01:38] that I feel like really is an issue in the real estate space
[00:01:42] right now.
[00:01:42] And that is loyalty.
[00:01:44] Now, when I say root problems, I mean loyalty seems
[00:01:48] to be hard to come by in the real estate community right now.
[00:01:51] And I think that that's what every agent is really striving for.
[00:01:54] So the question I really want to pose to all of you guys
[00:01:57] is if the root problem of the real estate business is loyalty,
[00:02:02] how do we create it?
[00:02:03] And that's where what I do really comes into play.
[00:02:06] And the answer to this question or the solution to this problem,
[00:02:10] in my opinion, is building community.
[00:02:13] So I really want to walk through some of the steps
[00:02:16] that I encourage you guys to take in order to build loyalty
[00:02:20] and what that actually looks like.
[00:02:22] And how does that relate to how we're showing up on Instagram
[00:02:25] or for that matter, how we're not.
[00:02:28] So let's jump into that.
[00:02:30] The answer again to the problem is we have to build communities.
[00:02:34] So how do we build community?
[00:02:36] And this is really done through our content.
[00:02:39] Now, what I believe is an issue with our content
[00:02:42] is we are trying to reproduce content
[00:02:45] that everybody else is producing.
[00:02:48] So if we go and we say, this is another agent in our market
[00:02:51] and they're doing really well
[00:02:52] and or their perception of what they're doing
[00:02:55] on social media seems to be really good.
[00:02:57] So guess what I'm going to do?
[00:02:59] I'm going to R&D that or I'm going to rip off and duplicate it.
[00:03:02] Well, the problem with that is that we are not creating our IT factor
[00:03:06] and we are most definitely not adding an opportunity
[00:03:09] or creating an opportunity for us to create our own lane
[00:03:12] or our own space.
[00:03:14] So with that, I really need you guys to understand
[00:03:17] that in order to build community through content,
[00:03:20] we have to create uniqueness.
[00:03:22] Now, what does uniqueness look like in a tactical aspect?
[00:03:27] So what do we actually have to do in order
[00:03:29] to create uniqueness in our space?
[00:03:32] So if you are that person listening to this and saying,
[00:03:35] hey, you know what?
[00:03:36] This person in my market is doing well.
[00:03:37] They recorded a video about this thing.
[00:03:40] So I'm going to go record the same video
[00:03:42] because why not?
[00:03:43] It worked for them.
[00:03:44] It should work for me.
[00:03:45] I want you guys to stop doing that.
[00:03:48] And that's what we're going to talk about in this specifically
[00:03:50] so that you guys can start to really create uniqueness
[00:03:54] and build your community.
[00:03:56] And the thing with building community too
[00:03:57] that I want to mention is every single one of you guys
[00:04:01] listening to this, your communities will be different.
[00:04:04] No two communities will be the same.
[00:04:06] And that is a good thing, right?
[00:04:08] So go find your people.
[00:04:11] And if you guys can do that, I pray that you understand
[00:04:14] the power of doing that.
[00:04:16] You guys will have a massive opportunity
[00:04:18] to differentiate yourself in a very crowded space
[00:04:22] on this platform.
[00:04:22] But let's get into the tactical piece
[00:04:24] and this data set on your screen, right?
[00:04:28] This is, it's funny that I'm sharing data
[00:04:30] when I'm about to share with you why I'm sharing data
[00:04:33] and how it relates to data.
[00:04:34] But I'm still going to share it with you guys anyway.
[00:04:37] And the two numbers you see on your screen, 63% and 5%.
[00:04:41] What are those numbers?
[00:04:43] What do they mean?
[00:04:44] Let's talk about those two things.
[00:04:46] So 63% is the metric for the percentage of people
[00:04:52] that say that they were a member,
[00:04:54] a story that they heard during a presentation.
[00:04:57] So in this particular study,
[00:04:59] and I've studied several studies about this conversation
[00:05:02] and about this topic, but 63% of people will say
[00:05:08] and have said that they remember stories over data, right?
[00:05:12] So that 5% means that 5% of people can say
[00:05:16] that they remember a specific data point
[00:05:18] or a specific statistic that they heard during a presentation.
[00:05:22] So 63% of people said they remember stories.
[00:05:26] Only 5% of people say that they remember
[00:05:28] any statistic shared with them during any presentation
[00:05:32] or keynote at all that they have ever heard.
[00:05:35] So this in here lies our solution to the problem
[00:05:38] and that solution is storytelling.
[00:05:41] So how do we do this?
[00:05:42] Why do we do this?
[00:05:43] What does it look like tactically in our content?
[00:05:46] Let's talk about that.
[00:05:47] So this vent diagram that you guys are looking at,
[00:05:50] this is this solution to the problem.
[00:05:52] And on the right-hand side of the screen,
[00:05:54] you're going to see passions on the vent diagram.
[00:05:57] I'm sorry, left-hand side, not right.
[00:05:58] Don't judge me for not being amazing at left and right.
[00:06:00] But on the left-hand side of your screen,
[00:06:03] you will see the word passion on the right-hand side.
[00:06:05] You will see expertise.
[00:06:07] And the intersection of those two things is our content.
[00:06:11] So if you're looking at this vent diagram,
[00:06:13] I want you to understand what this really means
[00:06:17] in a tactical play by play day-to-day operation.
[00:06:20] So when we are looking at this,
[00:06:22] I want you guys to do two big things.
[00:06:23] So I want you to create a list in front of you
[00:06:25] if you have a notebook, if you have a notepad,
[00:06:28] whatever, even if it's your phone notes
[00:06:30] on your iPhone or on your Android,
[00:06:33] pull up the notes tab and do this.
[00:06:34] I want you to write out three of your passions.
[00:06:37] And then I want you to write out three of the pain points
[00:06:40] that your ideal client has.
[00:06:43] And the pain points are really important
[00:06:45] because the pain points that someone has
[00:06:48] or that some of your clients have,
[00:06:50] that is your expertise, right?
[00:06:51] Because your expertise is overcoming those
[00:06:54] or solving those pain points.
[00:06:55] So when it says expertise, what that means is
[00:06:58] what are the pain points of your ideal clients
[00:07:01] that you are so good at overcoming
[00:07:03] because that is your expertise, right?
[00:07:05] So on one side,
[00:07:06] I want you to list out three of your passions,
[00:07:08] things that you love, things that make you you.
[00:07:10] On the other side,
[00:07:11] I want you to list out three of the pain points
[00:07:13] that your ideal client has
[00:07:15] because remember that the pain points
[00:07:18] that your ideal clients have, that is your expertise.
[00:07:20] That is what you are really good at solving.
[00:07:22] So we need to have that listed out.
[00:07:25] Now, the intersection of those two things
[00:07:27] is our content.
[00:07:29] So why am I telling you guys this?
[00:07:32] Why am I having you do this homework assignment?
[00:07:34] Here is why.
[00:07:35] In our content, we need to start sharing our passions.
[00:07:39] We need to start talking about the things that make us us.
[00:07:42] And we need to start creating content
[00:07:44] that serves specifically our community of people
[00:07:48] that we are trying to build a relationship with.
[00:07:50] Now, I'll use lots of examples here.
[00:07:52] I have a client who is a semi professional bowler
[00:07:55] and sells a ton of homes all year long.
[00:07:58] And when we first started talking through this assignment,
[00:08:01] he was like, well, I've all a lot.
[00:08:03] I'm like, amazing.
[00:08:04] How can we dissect the conversation of bowling
[00:08:06] in the sport of bowling and create content
[00:08:09] about the real estate market
[00:08:11] or about the real estate transaction
[00:08:13] and the pain points that your ideal clients have in that process?
[00:08:17] How do we combine bowling and that pain point?
[00:08:19] And that's where we now are creating content.
[00:08:23] Now, how do we do that?
[00:08:24] We have to use things like chat GPT,
[00:08:27] which I'll talk about here shortly.
[00:08:28] But the point of why this bend diagram is so, so, so important
[00:08:33] is that when we are producing content,
[00:08:36] our only goal is to create connection.
[00:08:39] That is it.
[00:08:40] Our only goal or Pete that is to create connection.
[00:08:43] We need someone to consume our content
[00:08:45] and say me too, or dang, that is awesome.
[00:08:48] Or wow, I had no idea that you could,
[00:08:51] somebody could tell us story about bowling
[00:08:53] and how that would then subliminally relate to real estate
[00:08:56] or buying and selling, right?
[00:08:58] Or I have another client Sarah, right,
[00:08:59] who loves, loves, loves plants.
[00:09:01] And I know I've talked about her before,
[00:09:03] specifically to you guys here in this audience,
[00:09:05] but what is so incredible about Sarah is she loves plants.
[00:09:10] So how do we tie the conversation around plants
[00:09:12] and what that means to her into how we actually produce content
[00:09:17] to build her community of other plant lovers?
[00:09:21] Now that's the, that's the amazing thing about this, right?
[00:09:24] If we can create content in that connection space
[00:09:26] and we do a good job of talking about things
[00:09:29] in that connection space,
[00:09:31] what will inadvertently happen
[00:09:32] is we will have more conversations,
[00:09:34] meaning we will be producing content
[00:09:36] that people want to engage with.
[00:09:38] That is the key.
[00:09:39] So if you are looking at other people's content
[00:09:41] and you're saying, wow, that video got 5,000 views,
[00:09:44] that's awesome, cool.
[00:09:45] But is that person having conversations?
[00:09:47] Is that person having people reach out
[00:09:49] and creating messages back and forth with them?
[00:09:51] Is that person actively outbound
[00:09:54] prospecting through their platform,
[00:09:56] talking to people that they don't know
[00:09:59] around this plant conversation
[00:10:01] to scale it or amplify the opportunity
[00:10:04] that that presents itself?
[00:10:05] The answer to that is 99% of the time know, right?
[00:10:09] So when we create content in this intersection
[00:10:12] of our passions and expertise,
[00:10:13] here's how this is gonna work.
[00:10:15] So you have your list of three passions,
[00:10:17] you have your list of your three expertise,
[00:10:19] AK, your three pain points,
[00:10:20] that your ideal clients have
[00:10:22] that you are so good at solving.
[00:10:24] And what we're gonna do is really use chat GPT
[00:10:26] to come up with content in that intersection space
[00:10:29] or in that overlap space.
[00:10:31] So we will ask chat GPT very candidly,
[00:10:33] can you create an analogy between
[00:10:35] expassion and expang point?
[00:10:38] Then at the end of what we send into chat GPT
[00:10:41] so that initial message,
[00:10:42] we will say this will be a five-part series.
[00:10:46] So can you please create an analogy
[00:10:48] that is broken down into five parts?
[00:10:50] Then it will spit it back out at us
[00:10:52] and we will have five beautiful individual things listed out.
[00:10:56] Each of those five things, guess what?
[00:10:58] We're gonna reverse engineer what it gives us
[00:11:00] and turn each of those five things into its own video
[00:11:02] that is 40 to 60 seconds.
[00:11:05] And it's going to tie in a passion
[00:11:07] and an expertise piece or a pain point part
[00:11:10] into this really beautiful video
[00:11:11] and that's gonna be a five-part series.
[00:11:14] So all of a sudden we are now solving the problem
[00:11:16] of I don't know what to be posting about,
[00:11:18] I don't know what to be talking about
[00:11:20] and we're building our community all at the same time.
[00:11:23] So no more real estate, talking heads,
[00:11:25] no more just word vomiting data or showcasing how busy
[00:11:29] we are, how many transactions we've done,
[00:11:30] how many listings we have active right now,
[00:11:32] how many people we have on our team,
[00:11:33] how much rev share we've made this month.
[00:11:35] All of those are great things,
[00:11:37] but the reality is that we have to create connection
[00:11:39] in our content first and foremost
[00:11:42] so that when I teach you guys later on how to prospect,
[00:11:45] that it will actually work, right?
[00:11:47] So many people wanna start prospecting right away,
[00:11:50] but the reality is is you cannot start
[00:11:52] in the prospecting space if your content is not good.
[00:11:56] And if your content is not speaking
[00:11:58] to the personal side of who you are,
[00:12:00] because if that part is missing
[00:12:01] and someone tries to outbound prospect, right?
[00:12:05] So let's say John, for example,
[00:12:07] I'm just gonna make this name of John
[00:12:08] starts to go out and actively prospect another buyer
[00:12:13] or seller in his specific city or neighborhood,
[00:12:15] whatever, right?
[00:12:16] As we build that out, let's say he's starting
[00:12:18] a conversation with Neem Michelle
[00:12:19] and we're talking about half marathon in our DMs.
[00:12:23] And I click on his profile and he's telling me
[00:12:25] that he's, you know, rent all these half marathons.
[00:12:27] I click on his profile and I'm like,
[00:12:28] well, I don't see any content at all anywhere
[00:12:31] about anything related to a half marathon.
[00:12:34] That connection point that we now built
[00:12:36] and that some semblance of trust that I now built
[00:12:39] with this person via DM in our messages
[00:12:41] is now totally obliterated because he is not showing up
[00:12:45] in the capacity that he said he was
[00:12:47] or he's not showing me that he is who he says he was.
[00:12:52] So in order for us to prospect,
[00:12:53] which is a huge, huge thing that I talk about all the time,
[00:12:56] we have to understand that our content is the horse
[00:12:59] before the whole part of that even begins, right?
[00:13:03] It's like trying to put the cart before the horse,
[00:13:04] you can't do it, right?
[00:13:05] So your content has to be there.
[00:13:07] Then we couple that with prospecting
[00:13:10] when those two things are working synonymously
[00:13:12] and hand in hand, we're now pouring gas
[00:13:14] on a really already roaring fire and now we're winning, right?
[00:13:19] So in our content, we have to remember
[00:13:20] that we have to showcase who we are as people.
[00:13:23] You have to share stories, tell things about who we are
[00:13:27] outside of work and outside of selling real estate
[00:13:30] and what does that look like, right?
[00:13:31] So the example of bowling that I was telling you guys
[00:13:34] about on one side, we have bowling as a passion
[00:13:38] on the other side, one of the pain points
[00:13:40] that my client wrote out as one of the pain points
[00:13:44] for his ideal clients, excuse me, was indecisive people.
[00:13:47] So he said one of the pain points for his clients
[00:13:49] is that they're indecisive, they feel overwhelmed
[00:13:53] with so many options, so many houses out there to choose from.
[00:13:56] How do you choose?
[00:13:57] Also, how do you make sure that you're choosing it wisely
[00:14:00] with the market the way that it is right now, right?
[00:14:03] So that's his pain point that he's gonna be using
[00:14:05] and the passion that he's gonna be using is bowling.
[00:14:09] So we will type in chat GPT, can you create an analogy
[00:14:12] between bowling and indecisive people,
[00:14:15] semi-colon explanation of what indecisive people means, right?
[00:14:19] So about a sentence or two of what indecisive people
[00:14:21] means to my client, Chad.
[00:14:23] And then at the end of that paragraph,
[00:14:25] we're gonna say to chat GPT,
[00:14:27] can you create a five part series out of this send, right?
[00:14:30] That's when we're then gonna get these five
[00:14:32] really beautiful pieces.
[00:14:33] And we're gonna reverse engineer each of those five things
[00:14:36] into its own video of 40 to 60 seconds.
[00:14:39] Now we're gonna also couple that with where do we post
[00:14:42] to this, I'm sorry, where do we record this content?
[00:14:45] So my client, Chad, who happens to be this example of bowling,
[00:14:48] he is actually going to record all five of these videos
[00:14:51] in the bowling alley, right?
[00:14:52] So we're going to literally get him in his element,
[00:14:56] create content about something that he loves in the place
[00:15:00] where he loves or in a scenario that he loves
[00:15:04] and the content will really shine through.
[00:15:07] And a lot of times what will happen when we do this really well
[00:15:10] is our audience will be like, dang,
[00:15:12] I had no idea where you were going with that, Chad,
[00:15:14] but that was so good, right?
[00:15:16] Like in a video holding a bowling ball,
[00:15:18] having this conversation.
[00:15:20] It's just more intentional content.
[00:15:22] It's more personal content.
[00:15:23] All of the bowling levers out there
[00:15:25] that are gonna see that are going to resonate and connect with it.
[00:15:28] And that is how Chad will win in creating connection,
[00:15:31] which then leads to conversation.
[00:15:33] And the bottom line guys, all of this comes down to one thing.
[00:15:37] We know that our goal is to create conversion.
[00:15:39] So if we are not building connections with people,
[00:15:42] we are definitely not going to be in conversation with them.
[00:15:45] If we're not in conversation with people,
[00:15:46] you can certainly kiss connection.
[00:15:48] I'm sorry, you can certainly kiss conversion goodbye.
[00:15:51] So connect in your content, that connection
[00:15:54] that we are building through what we share
[00:15:55] becomes the foundation of how we then prospect later on, right?
[00:16:00] Our content first, don't put the carto for the horse,
[00:16:02] then we start prospecting once our content
[00:16:04] is a well-oiled machine.
[00:16:06] And that prospecting includes talking about all of these passions
[00:16:09] and things that we enjoy.
[00:16:11] And then the content that's already now well-oiled,
[00:16:13] we know that if we prospect well, right?
[00:16:16] And we're talking about the passion things
[00:16:18] and our content is resonating
[00:16:20] and sharing those passionate things
[00:16:22] or things that we're passionate about.
[00:16:24] That connection is now sealed, right?
[00:16:26] We are now bonded with the people that we are talking about.
[00:16:28] So your content is the framework for how we prospect
[00:16:31] and literally quite honestly,
[00:16:33] the framework of conversations that we will then be having
[00:16:36] when we start prospecting.
[00:16:37] And if we do that well, then we will take off
[00:16:40] and not only creating more connections,
[00:16:42] but we'll be having way more conversations.
[00:16:44] And the reality is that you guys are in the sales business.
[00:16:47] If you're not having conversations, you're not converting.
[00:16:49] So we have to have more conversations.
[00:16:51] How do we then peel that layer back?
[00:16:53] We have to have more content that speaks to who we are
[00:16:55] outside of selling real estate and who we are as humans.
[00:16:59] And in doing that, we have to focus on one thing
[00:17:01] and one thing only creating connection
[00:17:03] through the art of storytelling.
[00:17:05] I hope that was super helpful.
[00:17:07] And I'll see you guys the next time I join you.

And now, on to our show. What's up, guys? Welcome to where we are going to talk about one of the root causes that I feel like really is an issue in the real estate space right now. And that is loyalty. Now, when I say root problems, I mean loyalty seems to be hard to come by in the real estate community right now. And I think that that's what every agent is really striving for. So the question I really want to pose to all of you guys is if the root problem of the real estate business is loyalty, how do we create it? And that's where what I do really comes into play. And the answer to this question or the solution to this problem, in my opinion, is building community. So I really want to walk through some of the steps that I encourage you guys to take in order to build loyalty and what that actually looks like. And how does that relate to how we're showing up on Instagram or for that matter, how we're not. So let's jump into that. The answer again to the problem is we have to build communities. So how do we build community? And this is really done through our content. Now, what I believe is an issue with our content is we are trying to reproduce content that everybody else is producing. So if we go and we say, this is another agent in our market and they're doing really well and or their perception of what they're doing on social media seems to be really good. So guess what I'm going to do? I'm going to R&D that or I'm going to rip off and duplicate it. Well, the problem with that is that we are not creating our IT factor and we are most definitely not adding an opportunity or creating an opportunity for us to create our own lane or our own space. So with that, I really need you guys to understand that in order to build community through content, we have to create uniqueness. Now, what does uniqueness look like in a tactical aspect? So what do we actually have to do in order to create uniqueness in our space? So if you are that person listening to this and saying, hey, you know what? This person in my market is doing well. They recorded a video about this thing. So I'm going to go record the same video because why not? It worked for them. It should work for me. I want you guys to stop doing that. And that's what we're going to talk about in this specifically so that you guys can start to really create uniqueness and build your community. And the thing with building community too that I want to mention is every single one of you guys listening to this, your communities will be different. No two communities will be the same. And that is a good thing, right? So go find your people. And if you guys can do that, I pray that you understand the power of doing that. You guys will have a massive opportunity to differentiate yourself in a very crowded space on this platform. But let's get into the tactical piece and this data set on your screen, right? This is, it's funny that I'm sharing data when I'm about to share with you why I'm sharing data and how it relates to data. But I'm still going to share it with you guys anyway. And the two numbers you see on your screen, 63% and 5%. What are those numbers? What do they mean? Let's talk about those two things. So 63% is the metric for the percentage of people that say that they were a member, a story that they heard during a presentation. So in this particular study, and I've studied several studies about this conversation and about this topic, but 63% of people will say and have said that they remember stories over data, right? So that 5% means that 5% of people can say that they remember a specific data point or a specific statistic that they heard during a presentation. So 63% of people said they remember stories. Only 5% of people say that they remember any statistic shared with them during any presentation or keynote at all that they have ever heard. So this in here lies our solution to the problem and that solution is storytelling. So how do we do this? Why do we do this? What does it look like tactically in our content? Let's talk about that. So this vent diagram that you guys are looking at, this is this solution to the problem. And on the right-hand side of the screen, you're going to see passions on the vent diagram. I'm sorry, left-hand side, not right. Don't judge me for not being amazing at left and right. But on the left-hand side of your screen, you will see the word passion on the right-hand side. You will see expertise. And the intersection of those two things is our content. So if you're looking at this vent diagram, I want you to understand what this really means in a tactical play by play day-to-day operation. So when we are looking at this, I want you guys to do two big things. So I want you to create a list in front of you if you have a notebook, if you have a notepad, whatever, even if it's your phone notes on your iPhone or on your Android, pull up the notes tab and do this. I want you to write out three of your passions. And then I want you to write out three of the pain points that your ideal client has. And the pain points are really important because the pain points that someone has or that some of your clients have, that is your expertise, right? Because your expertise is overcoming those or solving those pain points. So when it says expertise, what that means is what are the pain points of your ideal clients that you are so good at overcoming because that is your expertise, right? So on one side, I want you to list out three of your passions, things that you love, things that make you you. On the other side, I want you to list out three of the pain points that your ideal client has because remember that the pain points that your ideal clients have, that is your expertise. That is what you are really good at solving. So we need to have that listed out. Now, the intersection of those two things is our content. So why am I telling you guys this? Why am I having you do this homework assignment? Here is why. In our content, we need to start sharing our passions. We need to start talking about the things that make us us. And we need to start creating content that serves specifically our community of people that we are trying to build a relationship with. Now, I'll use lots of examples here. I have a client who is a semi professional bowler and sells a ton of homes all year long. And when we first started talking through this assignment, he was like, well, I've all a lot. I'm like, amazing. How can we dissect the conversation of bowling in the sport of bowling and create content about the real estate market or about the real estate transaction and the pain points that your ideal clients have in that process? How do we combine bowling and that pain point? And that's where we now are creating content. Now, how do we do that? We have to use things like chat GPT, which I'll talk about here shortly. But the point of why this bend diagram is so, so, so important is that when we are producing content, our only goal is to create connection. That is it. Our only goal or Pete that is to create connection. We need someone to consume our content and say me too, or dang, that is awesome. Or wow, I had no idea that you could, somebody could tell us story about bowling and how that would then subliminally relate to real estate or buying and selling, right? Or I have another client Sarah, right, who loves, loves, loves plants. And I know I've talked about her before, specifically to you guys here in this audience, but what is so incredible about Sarah is she loves plants. So how do we tie the conversation around plants and what that means to her into how we actually produce content to build her community of other plant lovers? Now that's the, that's the amazing thing about this, right? If we can create content in that connection space and we do a good job of talking about things in that connection space, what will inadvertently happen is we will have more conversations, meaning we will be producing content that people want to engage with. That is the key. So if you are looking at other people's content and you're saying, wow, that video got 5,000 views, that's awesome, cool. But is that person having conversations? Is that person having people reach out and creating messages back and forth with them? Is that person actively outbound prospecting through their platform, talking to people that they don't know around this plant conversation to scale it or amplify the opportunity that that presents itself? The answer to that is 99% of the time know, right? So when we create content in this intersection of our passions and expertise, here's how this is gonna work. So you have your list of three passions, you have your list of your three expertise, AK, your three pain points, that your ideal clients have that you are so good at solving. And what we're gonna do is really use chat GPT to come up with content in that intersection space or in that overlap space. So we will ask chat GPT very candidly, can you create an analogy between expassion and expang point? Then at the end of what we send into chat GPT so that initial message, we will say this will be a five-part series. So can you please create an analogy that is broken down into five parts? Then it will spit it back out at us and we will have five beautiful individual things listed out. Each of those five things, guess what? We're gonna reverse engineer what it gives us and turn each of those five things into its own video that is 40 to 60 seconds. And it's going to tie in a passion and an expertise piece or a pain point part into this really beautiful video and that's gonna be a five-part series. So all of a sudden we are now solving the problem of I don't know what to be posting about, I don't know what to be talking about and we're building our community all at the same time. So no more real estate, talking heads, no more just word vomiting data or showcasing how busy we are, how many transactions we've done, how many listings we have active right now, how many people we have on our team, how much rev share we've made this month. All of those are great things, but the reality is that we have to create connection in our content first and foremost so that when I teach you guys later on how to prospect, that it will actually work, right? So many people wanna start prospecting right away, but the reality is is you cannot start in the prospecting space if your content is not good. And if your content is not speaking to the personal side of who you are, because if that part is missing and someone tries to outbound prospect, right? So let's say John, for example, I'm just gonna make this name of John starts to go out and actively prospect another buyer or seller in his specific city or neighborhood, whatever, right? As we build that out, let's say he's starting a conversation with Neem Michelle and we're talking about half marathon in our DMs. And I click on his profile and he's telling me that he's, you know, rent all these half marathons. I click on his profile and I'm like, well, I don't see any content at all anywhere about anything related to a half marathon. That connection point that we now built and that some semblance of trust that I now built with this person via DM in our messages is now totally obliterated because he is not showing up in the capacity that he said he was or he's not showing me that he is who he says he was. So in order for us to prospect, which is a huge, huge thing that I talk about all the time, we have to understand that our content is the horse before the whole part of that even begins, right? It's like trying to put the cart before the horse, you can't do it, right? So your content has to be there. Then we couple that with prospecting when those two things are working synonymously and hand in hand, we're now pouring gas on a really already roaring fire and now we're winning, right? So in our content, we have to remember that we have to showcase who we are as people. You have to share stories, tell things about who we are outside of work and outside of selling real estate and what does that look like, right? So the example of bowling that I was telling you guys about on one side, we have bowling as a passion on the other side, one of the pain points that my client wrote out as one of the pain points for his ideal clients, excuse me, was indecisive people. So he said one of the pain points for his clients is that they're indecisive, they feel overwhelmed with so many options, so many houses out there to choose from. How do you choose? Also, how do you make sure that you're choosing it wisely with the market the way that it is right now, right? So that's his pain point that he's gonna be using and the passion that he's gonna be using is bowling. So we will type in chat GPT, can you create an analogy between bowling and indecisive people, semi-colon explanation of what indecisive people means, right? So about a sentence or two of what indecisive people means to my client, Chad. And then at the end of that paragraph, we're gonna say to chat GPT, can you create a five part series out of this send, right? That's when we're then gonna get these five really beautiful pieces. And we're gonna reverse engineer each of those five things into its own video of 40 to 60 seconds. Now we're gonna also couple that with where do we post to this, I'm sorry, where do we record this content? So my client, Chad, who happens to be this example of bowling, he is actually going to record all five of these videos in the bowling alley, right? So we're going to literally get him in his element, create content about something that he loves in the place where he loves or in a scenario that he loves and the content will really shine through. And a lot of times what will happen when we do this really well is our audience will be like, dang, I had no idea where you were going with that, Chad, but that was so good, right? Like in a video holding a bowling ball, having this conversation. It's just more intentional content. It's more personal content. All of the bowling levers out there that are gonna see that are going to resonate and connect with it. And that is how Chad will win in creating connection, which then leads to conversation. And the bottom line guys, all of this comes down to one thing. We know that our goal is to create conversion. So if we are not building connections with people, we are definitely not going to be in conversation with them. If we're not in conversation with people, you can certainly kiss connection. I'm sorry, you can certainly kiss conversion goodbye. So connect in your content, that connection that we are building through what we share becomes the foundation of how we then prospect later on, right? Our content first, don't put the carto for the horse, then we start prospecting once our content is a well-oiled machine. And that prospecting includes talking about all of these passions and things that we enjoy. And then the content that's already now well-oiled, we know that if we prospect well, right? And we're talking about the passion things and our content is resonating and sharing those passionate things or things that we're passionate about. That connection is now sealed, right? We are now bonded with the people that we are talking about. So your content is the framework for how we prospect and literally quite honestly, the framework of conversations that we will then be having when we start prospecting. And if we do that well, then we will take off and not only creating more connections, but we'll be having way more conversations. And the reality is that you guys are in the sales business. If you're not having conversations, you're not converting. So we have to have more conversations. How do we then peel that layer back? We have to have more content that speaks to who we are outside of selling real estate and who we are as humans. And in doing that, we have to focus on one thing and one thing only creating connection through the art of storytelling. I hope that was super helpful. And I'll see you guys the next time I join you.
