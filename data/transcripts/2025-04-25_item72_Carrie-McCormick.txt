[00:01:16] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage
[00:01:23] team? As a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't
[00:01:30] looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you
[00:01:34] there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly
[00:01:39] which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at
[00:01:46] your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting REALTOR's for 15 years
[00:01:51] and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been
[00:01:57] waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:03] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's
[00:02:08] AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:15] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can
[00:02:20] offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:27] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io
[00:02:34] to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now, onto the show.

[00:06:04] All right, enjoy the episode.
[00:06:19] Let's get rolling. So I'm going to start with our very first
[00:06:23] presenter and speaker and also somebody that is very influential here in the Chicago market.
[00:06:31] Maybe the most influential agent, honestly, as far as single individual agent. I would I say that
[00:06:37] not just because she's here, but I actually believe it and and Kiki actually would be got on.
[00:06:43] I don't know if everyone heard this, but she's one of our speakers today too. She's actually
[00:06:46] going to be getting coached, but she said, oh my gosh, Kerry McCormick, I haven't met you, but I
[00:06:51] am a huge follower of her. So everyone is a big follower of this of this person of Kerry. So I am
[00:06:57] so honored to have her. She has been not only an amazing influential person here in Chicago.
[00:07:02] She's a top, top, top producer, but she has been a huge friend to our show. When I first started
[00:07:07] the show and didn't have any listeners, Kerry said, I want to be a part of this. And she has been
[00:07:11] a part of this for as many years as I've had it. So seven years, maybe six, seven years. And she
[00:07:16] comes on every month. We're so grateful. And she is going to be doing more regular episodes.
[00:07:22] So she'll be on every month talking about how she grew her business and advice she has for agents.
[00:07:26] And boy, you know, this is a person that just doesn't have time to do this and she makes time for
[00:07:31] us. So we're super honored to have her. This is a very important thing, very important person for
[00:07:36] us here on our show. And we are huge fans of Kerry's. But let me tell you about Kerry McCormick, if
[00:07:41] you aren't yet familiar, she is by the way with at properties, Christie's International here in
[00:07:48] Chicago. She is for over two decades. Kerry McCormick has defined, defined excellence in Chicago's
[00:07:54] real estate market, setting the gold standard across all neighborhoods and price points with an
[00:07:59] extraordinary career surpassing 2.2 billion in sales, including an impressive 200 million in production
[00:08:06] alone in 2024. Last year doing 200 million. That is incredible. That was maybe the hardest year. It
[00:08:15] was the lowest year in 30 years for home sales. And Kerry still crushed 200 million. That's
[00:08:20] pretty awesome. She's more than a top producer though. She is a first of all a friend to our show. She's
[00:08:25] a total visionary and leader and just a force to be reckoned with. And also one of the nicest people
[00:08:33] you could ever meet, honestly. So this is somebody who should have a gigantic ego and she just doesn't.
[00:08:38] And I think that is something that is really a hallmark of the my favorite people in this industry.
[00:08:44] Top superstars who are approachable and sweet and kind and Kerry is absolutely all of those things.
[00:08:49] So I want everybody to follow her specifically on Instagram. Now she is all over social media. We'll
[00:08:55] have links to all I'll post this soon as we start talking. Rosanna can post her links in the chat.
[00:09:01] But her Instagram is legendary. She does it all herself too. When you see this, you're not going to
[00:09:07] believe that she does it all herself. Now, you know, sometimes she has crews filming and stuff for her,
[00:09:11] but she posted she edits it. She does all the heavy lifting. It is so cool. You won't believe that
[00:09:16] a single person could do this. It's Kerry McCormick real estate. So we'll have Zana if she
[00:09:20] is on a can post a link there. If not, I'll do it here in a little bit. We'll have a link to that.
[00:09:24] And we'll send that out to you as well. So and you can always visit our website,
[00:09:29] Kerry McCormick real estate.com as well, which is really a cool looking website and really showcases
[00:09:35] how her her rise in the Chicago line market in the luxury has just been phenomenal. And everybody
[00:09:45] doesn't only do luxury. Obviously she helps really anyone that she can, but she is really the
[00:09:50] person that luxury clients go to. She just is she attracts them. She gets them and she's going to
[00:09:56] talk about that today. All right, Kerry, I'm going to unmute you. Sorry, no, you're on mute. Great.
[00:10:01] Welcome to the show once again. Thank you. That's such a nice introduction. And I truly appreciate
[00:10:07] it. And I think one thing that you said is and I appreciate that you said that I'm a nice person.
[00:10:13] And I think people overlook kindness just in general in this in the world and in our industry.
[00:10:19] And you know, part of my success is putting ego aside and putting the client first and just
[00:10:24] being kind, you know, and it takes you a long way. And not everybody is kind. And I've I've
[00:10:30] asked Kerry this over the years because she's so important here in Chicago. I just assume everybody
[00:10:35] is super kind and nice to her because she's so kind and nice and she's like, oh no, she's like,
[00:10:41] you would be shocked at how people talk to me. Other agents talk to me in this business. And I'm just,
[00:10:46] it blows my mind. So, you know, obviously being kind and nice is really going to be helpful for you.
[00:10:53] Even if it's just to make better relationships. But agents like closing deals with people they like,
[00:10:58] that's another thing too. But anyway, Kerry is kind and nice. And also evident doing this today for
[00:11:04] us. Again, another big thank you to her. All right, Kerry, let's start. I want to start all the way
[00:11:09] to the beginning. I know this story, but the audience might not. So tell us, you know, you were in a
[00:11:14] totally different industry. You were in in like the marketing sort of ad world. And you were looking
[00:11:20] for a change. First of all, let's figure out why. And then how, how did you do that? Yeah. So,
[00:11:26] I was in marketing. I worked for a company called E-Trade. And this is, you know, going back to the
[00:11:31] .com boom, where it was the one of the best industries to be in a great company to be in.
[00:11:37] But I realized, you know, I was a little more rubble spirited than I thought. You know, I just,
[00:11:44] I don't want to say I'm not a rule follower because it doesn't sound right. But I, I just like,
[00:11:49] you know, carving my own pathways and, you know, making my own rules kind of, you know, as an
[00:11:53] entrepreneur, right? And when you work for a company in corporation, there's rules that you have to
[00:11:59] follow. So again, we're going back to late 1990s, the late 1990s. And I, again, I was working at a
[00:12:10] great company, had a cushy job, corner office, great views. And I just wasn't fulfilled. You know,
[00:12:17] it was obviously very young at the time. But I knew that there was something bigger and better
[00:12:21] out there for me. And again, having that rubble spirited demeanor in me and wanting to be more of an
[00:12:29] entrepreneur, I had decided to go out for a walk one day. And it was a walk because something was
[00:12:37] going wrong at the job, at my job, I don't remember what it was, but I was just feeling anxious. I got
[00:12:41] up and I left the office for a walk. That my office was in the A.N. building. Excuse me. And I ended
[00:12:49] up walking all the way to the West Loop. Upon my arrival in the West Loop, they were doing construction.
[00:12:56] And I walked up to the construction site asking what was happening on, you know, we're in the middle
[00:13:02] of nowhere. And, you know, there's diggers, there's, you know, activity going on, they're building a
[00:13:07] building. And of course, my curiosity, you know, just led me right to the gentleman, his name was Tom.
[00:13:14] And I asked him, you know, what were they doing? And excuse me, everyone, I was getting over a cold.
[00:13:20] And Tom proceeded to let me know that they were building a residential building. And of course,
[00:13:27] being rubble spirited, I disagreed with Tom. I said, you know, no one's going to live in the West Loop.
[00:13:31] I don't know why you're even building here. And, you know, we had this nice banter back and forth.
[00:13:37] And Tom had asked me, you know, are you in real estate? And of course, I said, well, yes, I am. I'm
[00:13:42] in real estate. And I know what I'm talking about. And, you know, he's, you were not in real estate.
[00:13:48] But I wasn't real estate. So, Tom said, you know, I'd love to meet with you at my office next week.
[00:13:55] And we set up a day and time for me to meet with him. Well, of course, I scurried back to my office,
[00:14:00] realizing that I just fibbed to this gentleman that, you know, I had my real estate, or I was in real
[00:14:06] estate. So I quickly got online. And I looked up how to get my real estate license. I signed up
[00:14:12] immediately for the class. When I went to go meet with Tom the following week, I did obviously tell him
[00:14:20] that I said, Tom, I just want to, you know, tell you the truth. I do not have my license. But I am
[00:14:26] signed up for the class, you know, so he kind of took that as, you know, appreciated, you know, that I
[00:14:31] kind of cleared the ear air on that. But I'll say he was completely fine with me. He's like,
[00:14:36] that's fine. Just finished the class. But I want to talk with you. So we sat down. We, I was at his
[00:14:41] office for hours and we went through floor plans and we went through different things. And at the
[00:14:46] end of the meeting, he said, I want to hire you. I want you to run the sales of this new building.
[00:14:53] And keep in mind, I came from a corporate job where I had, you know, salary benefits, you know,
[00:14:58] everything that a big corporation would offer somebody. But I knew that this was my opportunity.
[00:15:04] I knew this was my calling. And I took a leap of faith. And here we are.
[00:15:10] Yeah, I love that, you know, this, this idea that you can go somewhere and talk to someone and
[00:15:17] then figure out how to solve the problem of oh gosh, now I have this appointment. And, you know,
[00:15:23] it's, it's a great thing to take a chance. And you did that. And here you are now all these years
[00:15:28] later. So let's talk about how you got started. So everyone gets started with zero clients, zero
[00:15:36] idea of how they're going to survive. And also probably a lot of fear, right? And I know certainly,
[00:15:41] I talked to new agents almost every day and people who just get their license. And I always ask them,
[00:15:46] what are you most scared of? Because I always think that's kind of the most interesting thing. And
[00:15:49] it's usually the one question. It's leads. It's how do I get leads? How do I grow my business?
[00:15:54] Obviously that is everybody's concerned because leads always love this expression. Uh,
[00:15:59] Robert Brian Tracy said he goes, um, lead solve all problems. And I think that's pretty true. I
[00:16:04] don't maybe it's not all problems. But it certainly solves the problem of how to stay in the business.
[00:16:08] So let's talk about leads. Like how did you when you started? How did you sort of find business?
[00:16:15] Yeah. So, you know, my career is 25 years and it was split up into two different segments. I
[00:16:21] call it. So the first decade of my career, I was in development. So just like that story,
[00:16:27] I worked for the developer and we did that building in the West Loop. And we continued on to several
[00:16:32] other buildings. And then from there, I was recruited with two, some of the other major developers
[00:16:39] here in Chicago. So for the first 10 to 12 years of my career, I was on the development side.
[00:16:46] And I learned a tremendous amount of knowledge and information through that experience. And also
[00:16:54] keep in mind all of these people that I interacted with for 10 years, right? You know, I'm selling
[00:16:59] a tower and people were coming into the sales center. I built an incredible database.
[00:17:06] My career changed in really the pivoting of the 2008 crash, right? So the market crashes in 2008.
[00:17:16] And that lasts a couple of years. During 08 through, I think it was like 2011-ish.
[00:17:23] You know, I still worked with the developers because we had to redefine the business and
[00:17:29] you know, get out of a certain certain things. But then I went into brokerage around 2011-2012.
[00:17:36] It's hard to even think back that far. And that's where really my development
[00:17:43] expertise came into place because I had all those leads, right? I had already built 10 plus years
[00:17:50] of clientele. So I feel like I was lucky that I had a little bit of a head start,
[00:17:56] but it was still starting from scratch, right? And, you know, networking and having a good CRM
[00:18:03] and following up with people, just those fundamental attributes of what we do was so important during that time.
[00:18:10] Yeah, thanks for that. I want to talk about developers because this is something that you, even though
[00:18:17] you work with, you know, individual home buyers and sellers and not always for the developer,
[00:18:23] you are chosen to work for developers even today in luxury buildings and all sorts of projects.
[00:18:29] I live in one of your developments. That's, it's not a small place. And it's funny. The reason I live
[00:18:35] there, I like Gary so much that I was like, I want to support her because she said, I have this new
[00:18:40] development. This is four years ago, maybe five years ago. She says, why don't you come check it out?
[00:18:45] And I was like, okay, I really didn't have any intention of buying anything. And I walked into the
[00:18:50] showroom and I was like, oh, oh, I want this. And so I happened to live in one of Carrie's
[00:18:54] developments. So how funny is that? And I, it's, was one of the best purchases I ever made. What a
[00:18:59] cool development that I get to live in. But Carrie gets chosen for these. And yes, she started her
[00:19:04] career doing that. But there's a lot of agents that would like to break into that market. It is not an
[00:19:09] easy market to break into. You are up against some real heavy hitters because of course, developers,
[00:19:14] they just want their stuff sold for the highest price possible. And they want somebody that really
[00:19:18] knows what they're doing. But I would love Carrie if you had any advice for somebody who's like,
[00:19:24] I want to get into development. I want to get to work with developers and get chosen. What are
[00:19:30] some of the ways that if you were starting over, you might, you know, approach that?
[00:19:35] Yeah, it's funny when you say starting over, it's just it's such a daunting word to think back,
[00:19:40] you know, my brain automatically goes back to all of the hard work and the, you know, the road,
[00:19:45] through, through where I've gotten today. But what developers want is, you know, someone that does
[00:19:52] have a wide network, right? So to work for these developers, they want you to be able to pick up the
[00:19:58] phone and call anyone and everybody that you know. So they also want you to be an advocate for
[00:20:06] that development, right? And for you to believe in that and be able to be more boots on the ground
[00:20:12] and, you know, get out there and, you know, kind of really be an influencer or a spokesperson for
[00:20:19] that development. You're the brand and the face of that development. So, you know, again, having
[00:20:24] deep rooted network, having the social ability to be able to get out and be able to articulate
[00:20:31] the development and why it's so great. And again, remain focused on that development is super important
[00:20:36] to them. And you probably, when you worked for developer, initially, you saw probably a lot of
[00:20:43] REALTORS come through. You probably got to see what good agents who bring in their buyers,
[00:20:50] you know, good agents, how they show these properties when they're not representing the development.
[00:20:54] I'm sure you saw a lot of good and bad. And it probably was a great also learning center for you
[00:20:59] just to see what are the better agents doing. I imagine. I still do that today, you know, even when I
[00:21:05] go on my showings when I'm with a buyer or obviously, you know, working on the seller side, when agents
[00:21:11] come in, I'm always learning, right? You always look at other brokers and how they're presenting, how
[00:21:17] they talk to their clients, how they negotiate. You know, it's a strategy, you know, and you think about,
[00:21:22] I use it, sports as an analogy quite a bit, right? Because like football, like you study the other
[00:21:27] teams moves, you study their plays, you know, and as a broker, you know, we're all friendly with each
[00:21:33] other, but you know, we are competing with each other too. So understanding, you know, how another
[00:21:39] are competitors work and how they perform really can set you apart too in negotiations and again,
[00:21:48] just understanding how they work. So it's still, you know, it's an everyday learning curve for me.
[00:21:52] I'm always paying attention listening, watching and learning. I also wonder too, you know, going back
[00:21:59] to how to have developers choose you. Again, understanding, you know, being an expert in their
[00:22:04] development, also making sure that they know you have this wide network and also just being able to
[00:22:09] show the properties in a way that they want you to show them and be their advocate. There's also this
[00:22:15] like, well, how do I get in front of developers? Well, Kerry went on a long walk and found one and
[00:22:20] did that. I've heard of lots of stories like that from other agents. It's not that uncommon, but
[00:22:25] let's just assume that every developer currently is already working with a top agent. Well, at some
[00:22:31] point, they might not be happy with that agent, right? Developers are fickle. They're funny. They
[00:22:35] might blame the agent who they have representing them for things that are unsolved just because the
[00:22:40] price is too high and agent can't maybe control that. So there's times when agents get replaced, they
[00:22:45] get moved on or developers like, well, let's see who else is out there. So if I were, you know, again,
[00:22:50] going out to developers is probably this long process. It's not like you're going to go there,
[00:22:55] you're going to make your pitch. They're going to go, cool. Here's 20 properties to sell. Like,
[00:22:58] that's a dream. That's a fantasy that might happen, but probably not. So, Kerry, would you
[00:23:03] even suggest going to some of these developers and offering to do things kind of almost like
[00:23:08] unpro bono at the moment or at least saying, let me be your backup in case something goes wrong. Or,
[00:23:15] you know, how would you approach that if someone already has an agent? Obviously, you don't want to
[00:23:18] take their business away from the agent. We know that that's a no no. But what could you do to start
[00:23:23] a relationship with a developer that's already got somebody? Yeah, well, I would say bring the
[00:23:28] developer some business, you know, because that's what they want. Right? There you go. You know,
[00:23:34] so you have to always think about what does the developer want? They want the unit sold, right?
[00:23:38] And you're right. We never want to step on anyone's relationship because I wouldn't want someone to
[00:23:42] do that to me. So obviously, be respectful of that. But, you know, there's always, you're right.
[00:23:49] Things always sometimes I shouldn't always, but you know, things sometimes take a turn and the developer
[00:23:54] needs to hire a backup person and you do want to be that backup person. So communication, staying
[00:23:59] in touch, providing value when you can. And then obviously bring them a buyer or two or three,
[00:24:06] you know, they're going to start to see your name again and again and see that you're active in
[00:24:09] the market, right? And this way, you're giving and not asking for anything. You're giving the developer
[00:24:15] business, but you're not, you know, right? They're asking. So it's kind of like give, give, give, ask,
[00:24:21] you know, so that kind of my philosophy is don't always ask for things, but give a few times,
[00:24:26] and then you can ask. And this is why it's important when you are bringing buyers to make sure that
[00:24:31] they can close, right? And this has a lot to do with the lender. If it's if it's a non cash offer,
[00:24:35] this isn't really important thing is you want, if you're going to bring some developer a deal,
[00:24:40] it really obviously ideally will close. You want that to close. They want it to close. But you
[00:24:44] also just want them to go, wow, this person knows what they're doing. They get stuff done. Now,
[00:24:47] obviously things can happen and things might not close. But this is where having a good lender is
[00:24:52] really, really super important. And good lenders can get deals closed. And so obviously that's something
[00:24:57] that you want to consider. I want to switch gears a little bit and talk about working with, you
[00:25:05] know, traditional buyers and sellers, because I know one thing is you win a lot of listings. You do
[00:25:11] probably more listings. I haven't looked at your data lately, but I'm sure it's more listings
[00:25:15] than than buy side, although who knows these days. But you do get chosen a lot for listings. And
[00:25:21] from people who just hear about you who aren't, you know, repeat clients. So,
[00:25:25] but you're sometimes up against other top agents. You know, somebody selling a several million dollar
[00:25:29] property, it probably be in their best interest to get a couple of appointments. You're right. So
[00:25:34] that's just going to happen a lot of the time, even though you might be a referral. So when you're
[00:25:39] up against another agent, or even if you're not, what are you doing in a listing presentation that
[00:25:44] you think really helps you win the business? Well, is net top secret there, DJ? Do I really want to
[00:25:51] tell you all that? No, I'm just joking. You know, you know, I don't know what I do different than
[00:25:59] other brokers, honestly, like I wish I could sit in another broker's listing presentations, right?
[00:26:07] But I do know that I try to stay focused on the client through the presentation and what their
[00:26:13] needs are, right? Because listening to what they want and catering to their needs is obviously
[00:26:19] the most important. The one thing that I will never do is obviously bad mouth another agent, right?
[00:26:27] And I know that that's happened to me in the sense of like, I'll be in an interview and those
[00:26:32] in the clients will say, well, we met with a few other brokers and broker X said this about you.
[00:26:39] And this broker said that you don't do this or whatever, you know? And so I'm consistently
[00:26:46] having to combat those comments. So I just think that that's not an appropriate thing to do. And
[00:26:54] you know, and I always say like, well, I'm so sorry that he or she, you know, feels that way. But let me,
[00:27:00] you know, give you an app, like, let me have the opportunity to talk to you about that and why that's
[00:27:04] a concern, maybe a concern of yours. So again, I try to stay focused on the clients. And it's
[00:27:11] all results driven, right? At the end of the day, a seller just wants their home closed for the
[00:27:15] most amount of money, right? And they want service. So my job is to show them and tell them how I can
[00:27:22] provide a high level of service to them, what I do, kind of a play by play. And I also talk to
[00:27:29] them about my support staff. So one thing that a lot of people don't know about me is that I am an
[00:27:35] individual agent. I don't have a big team of agents that are out showing. I have the most, what I
[00:27:43] think the most amazing team support team behind me that helps me remain in the field and remain focused.
[00:27:50] And I have built my business that way because I feel like that that's, you know, again,
[00:27:55] giving my clients the best service. And they feel that too because they feel that when I say it's
[00:28:00] 100% carry that that's what they get. And I, one thing I also know about you is you answer your phone.
[00:28:07] And, you know, it's, it's, it's funny because we think, well, everybody does, but they don't.
[00:28:12] Not everybody does. I, I've talked to other top agents who have said the main distinction between
[00:28:17] me and other agents is I call my clients once a week tell them how things are going. Even if there's
[00:28:22] no news to report and I answer the phone and they call me and I anticipate their questions ahead of
[00:28:27] time. I know you do this because obviously you are just so well respected in this industry. And it
[00:28:33] is results driven, you know, you don't get those big listings or big buyers without having a big
[00:28:38] track record behind you. I want to share and I'm going to keep this very intentionally vague as to
[00:28:42] protect the privacy because, but I wanted to share a one way that I've known you've gone above and
[00:28:48] beyond. And I think this is so cool. I get this very, very vague. But Carrie had a deal at one point
[00:28:52] that was going to close. It was a very big deal. And it didn't close at the last minute for whatever
[00:28:57] reason. And you were representing the, the seller. And it didn't close. And it was, this is like a
[00:29:04] devastating loss. Like it's like, oh my gosh, I can't believe this isn't going to close. It was all
[00:29:08] the way she had done months and months of work. And it just for whatever reason it just didn't,
[00:29:12] wasn't going to close. And not her phone. And so she's like, oh my god, I'm going to lose this deal
[00:29:17] because this client's kind of wacky or whatever. So anyway, she goes, I'm going to, I know I'm
[00:29:24] going to find a creative solution. And she looks for other properties in the area that basically match
[00:29:29] what this property offered. And she starts reaching out to the homeowners and saying, I, I have this
[00:29:35] opportunity for you. I don't know if the buyer is going to be interested. She wasn't representing
[00:29:39] the buyer, by the way. She's like, I don't know, but I have this person and this deal isn't going to
[00:29:43] close. Do you have another? Can I can we come and take a look? Now these are homes not on the
[00:29:47] market. She literally looked for properties. And like, this is how top agents do it. They don't,
[00:29:53] you know, they lose deals. Everybody does. And then they say, how can I still solve this problem?
[00:29:57] And she found somebody right away. The person said, sure, I'll be willing to entertain somebody
[00:30:02] was not looking to sell their home. And then she was able to close that deal. Incredible, right? Now
[00:30:06] it sounds so simple, but most agents are going to do those kind of things. So I love that you have
[00:30:11] this creative way of solving problems. And I imagine when you get listings, you often do have to find
[00:30:17] the buyers, especially in the luxury side, right? Because, you know, we think, well, if we just got a
[00:30:21] $5 million property, like that's wonderful as a listing agent, but there aren't that many people
[00:30:26] just waiting for $5 million homes to jump on the market. So you have to actually source the buyer
[00:30:31] a lot of times too. Isn't that correct? Oh, you're up. You're muted by the way. Sorry.
[00:30:37] That is correct. And I'm glad that you remember that story because that is part of our job is
[00:30:42] brokers is to always come up with solutions, right? You know, and I am one if, you know, there's
[00:30:49] never any problems. There's always, you know, I, if anyone comes to me with a problem, I've always
[00:30:54] have a solution for them. Everything can be worked out. I love that. What I want to curious to,
[00:31:01] like when you get luxury listings, it's not always as simple as throwing it on the MLS and making
[00:31:06] sure there's a cool website for the property. And, you know, it's, it's more than that. You're
[00:31:11] calling agents who have clients who are in that space and you're saying, hey, I got something you
[00:31:17] got to come look at. That's something that a lot of listing agents never think to do. Right.
[00:31:23] No, I mean, it's, it's a different market when you deal with the luxury, you know, just from
[00:31:27] everything how you handle the listing to marketing the listing to your, your narrative about the home,
[00:31:34] everything is just very different. I have a question about work life balance because you are so
[00:31:39] incredibly busy. You don't have this team, even though people probably assume you do because of
[00:31:45] your production size, like here in Chicago, the agents that do the kind of deals that Kerry does,
[00:31:50] most of them have these giant production teams. Kerry doesn't have that. She has support teams.
[00:31:54] She has amazing people on her team, but she's the rainmaker. She's doing the work and she answers
[00:31:59] the phone and she is busy and she's a mom and she has family and husband and, you know, her own
[00:32:04] life as well. How do you deal with work life balance? I know that's probably a challenge,
[00:32:09] but what is it that you do? How do you think about that? Because a lot of agents are going, oh gosh,
[00:32:14] I hate those 10 p.m. you know, text messages from clients. No, it's tough. I mean, there's no easy,
[00:32:20] you know, there's no magic solution to it. It's not easy, you know, so I don't want to say there's,
[00:32:27] I don't even think that there's really a good answer for work life balance, honestly.
[00:32:31] You know, and yes, I have two older children now, two young adults will call them,
[00:32:38] you know, and a husband and, you know, extended family and friends and, you know, I do try to
[00:32:44] segment my time and my day and prioritize, but I feel like I've got such a well-oiled machine and,
[00:32:50] you know, when I'm with my family, I'm extremely present with my family and, you know, when I work,
[00:32:56] when I work, I'm the most efficient person at work too, you know, I feel like I can get
[00:33:02] 10 things done in two minutes, you know, it's just it's just the way that my brain works. So,
[00:33:08] you know, it works for me, but everyone's got to find their own thing.
[00:33:13] Yeah, and you are willing to put in a ton of hours, and that is something that is just,
[00:33:19] if you want to get to the top of the mountain, I don't see another way to that. It's kind of like
[00:33:25] getting strong in the gym. You're just going to have to put yourself in the pathway of extreme
[00:33:29] physical pain if you want, so, you know, big muscles, or if you want muscles and you want longevity
[00:33:35] and you want, you know, good health. It's like, you got to be willing to do the things that most
[00:33:39] agents aren't willing to do, which is work. And, and I'm not saying most agents don't work, but,
[00:33:43] but work maybe more effectively, more efficiently plan your day, those kind of things. I want to
[00:33:49] switch gears and ask about client relationships. So, you work with somebody, you find them home,
[00:33:55] or sell their home, and then, you know, they're probably not moving for a while. So, what are you
[00:33:59] doing to stay top of mind or back of mind so that they remember, you know, in seven years,
[00:34:05] ten years, whenever they need you again, that you're the still the person that they want to reach out to.
[00:34:10] Yeah, I think, you know, client retention and client outreach is super important. And I think
[00:34:15] all of us do have a challenge with that because, you know, our job is multi-functional, meaning,
[00:34:21] you know, we're trying to get business, we're trying to retain our business, we're trying to
[00:34:24] follow up with clients. There's a lot to it. Obviously, maintaining a good CRM is important.
[00:34:30] You know, I send out, I've got a list and I try to, you know, when I say try, I really try to,
[00:34:37] you know, reach out to clients, you know, every gosh, six months, you know, if I see anything
[00:34:43] on socials, great, if you see if someone's having a baby or a wedding or, you know, anything
[00:34:47] change in life of reaching out and acknowledging that, I think that's important.
[00:34:52] Just even mailings, you know, keeping someone in your email or, you know, your,
[00:34:57] your newsletters is important. I try to do many events every, you know, once or twice a year and
[00:35:04] invite people to the events as well so we can see each other face to face. What I'd really like to do
[00:35:09] is to do one-on-one coffee and dinner, but I don't think there's enough time in the world to do all that.
[00:35:14] But that's one of my goals for this year. Also, I want to talk about having a network of
[00:35:21] ANSLA, say a Larry, as an American or say that word right, ANSLA Larry, people that you can refer
[00:35:27] when your clients need a service. It could be everything from a state planning. It could be, you know,
[00:35:35] attorneys, it could be accountants, it could be people to fix a roof or, you know,
[00:35:40] people who can redevelop a property or do renovations. So how important is it for you to have
[00:35:46] that network and how often are your clients reaching out to you going, I need your help. And I assume
[00:35:52] that's a huge deal for you because if you become that knowledge source, then hopefully they continue
[00:35:56] to use you. But how important is having that team? No, that's extremely important and it's grown over
[00:36:02] the last, you know, 20 years of my career. And it's changed because, you know, service providers
[00:36:09] change as well, right? They're their level of service or if they don't service my clients, I'll move
[00:36:14] on and find somebody else. So I think I've got a great team of people and but it happens all the time.
[00:36:20] And just a quick, funny story is a client of mine called me at like 9, 30 or 10 o'clock at night.
[00:36:26] And of course, I answer the phone because I was a little worried. But they said, oh my gosh,
[00:36:31] we have a leak, you know, the shower is leaking. It's leaking in our ceiling. I'm thinking like,
[00:36:35] why would you call me? You know, you know, like I even talked to you in a few months, but, you know,
[00:36:39] like why would you call me, you know, call a plumber, you know, but it was, you know, I took it as,
[00:36:46] of course, I helped them. I got them a plumber and we got it taken care of. But it's just,
[00:36:50] it's funny how that I'm the first person that they call, especially in an emergency, you know,
[00:36:55] it's like, you need to call the plumber, you need to call, you know, your HVAC person.
[00:37:01] But, you know, I'm happy to be a resource and, you know, it's, I know people sometimes freak out
[00:37:06] when things happen. So they are looking for someone to calm them down and, you know, find a solution
[00:37:11] for them. So I'm happy to do that. But I'm kind of daily the first call of something goes wrong.
[00:37:18] So I want to ask a question about being a listing agent and receiving offers from buyer agents.
[00:37:25] Only because I want to know what, you know, you do a lot of listings. What is annoying about
[00:37:31] receiving offers? In other words, when are there agents that aren't really putting making it easy
[00:37:36] for you to interpret the offer, to present the offer? And what are agents doing that you're like,
[00:37:41] think, you know, I love it when I get an offer from this person because they just make it so easy.
[00:37:46] So I'm curious, like, are there little do's and don'ts when, you know, when you're dealing with,
[00:37:51] because you want, as a state, as, you know, as a buyer's agent, you want the list agent to like you,
[00:37:55] you know, it helps do the, well, maybe you don't want them to like you, but I would assume you'd want
[00:37:58] them to like you. But at least when you're submitting offers, you know, I hear all the time right now,
[00:38:03] people are saying, gosh, my offers are just getting out bid. I'm not hearing back. You know, so what
[00:38:07] are, what are some of the things you like to see from the buyer agents when you do get those offers?
[00:38:12] Well, I think it starts with the showing, honestly, before you're going to make the offer, I think,
[00:38:15] you know, it's kind of like the pre-interview, right, at the, at the showing. So, you know, if,
[00:38:21] if a broker's coming in and he or she wants to be very combative during the showing and, you know,
[00:38:26] start questioning things and if the buyers are, you know, nervous Nellies and they're questioning,
[00:38:31] you know, the integrity of the home or something, you know, it's kind of like you kind of have a
[00:38:35] little bit of an idea of the personality that you're going to get with this deal, you know. So,
[00:38:40] I always think, you know, again, if it's something that you and your client want, try to be on your
[00:38:45] best behavior, especially with all of the ring doorbells and cameras and people's homes, you know,
[00:38:50] sellers are watching, you know, if you're going to say something, derogatory or negative about the
[00:38:55] client's home, you know, just don't say it. You know, so- Wait until you're in your cars.
[00:39:00] Wait until you're in your car because there's been plenty of times, like my sellers will say,
[00:39:05] like, oh, I overheard them walking out saying that they hate my, you know, my furniture or something,
[00:39:11] you know, it's just like, and then we get an offer from them and it's like super awkward.
[00:39:16] You know, so I think just be on your best behavior during the showings, number one.
[00:39:21] But just to answer your question, I think when you send an offer over, I think it's really
[00:39:27] professional practice to call the broker. You know, pick up the phone and call and say, you know,
[00:39:33] good news. I've got an offer coming in. Let me tell you a little bit about our offer. Have a
[00:39:38] dialogue, have a conversation. And when you send the offer over, it's great when it's completed.
[00:39:44] I cannot tell you how many times I get offers that have are they misspell the seller's name.
[00:39:50] They miss signatures. They ask for, you know, things to be included in the home, but they bury it
[00:39:59] in the contract. So like, you're kind of like they're trying to sneak it in and then they're
[00:40:04] summary, they don't list it, you know, and it's just, I think just being thorough. I mean,
[00:40:11] I feel like that's, is that too much to ask? I mean, we're filling out a contract. So just
[00:40:15] make sure that it's accurate and things are spelled correctly. You know, it's funny about,
[00:40:20] about the phone call is I know lots of top agents, and I always ask them, when you get offers
[00:40:25] with your listings, the agent calls you, right? And they're like, most of the time, no,
[00:40:30] most agents don't pick up the phone and call, which is shocking because the, and the main reason
[00:40:37] that I've heard or one of the main reasons that might not occur to people is the other agent is
[00:40:41] maybe now thinking, if you don't call, how serious are you about this deal? How committed are you
[00:40:46] to this industry? Right? Like if you're not doing this for your client, what's going to happen
[00:40:51] 10 days before closing? Like, are you in? Is this, are you in or you not in? So I think that is also
[00:40:58] just a good reason is the agent is going to be impressed, even though you think I don't want to
[00:41:01] bother the agent, they're getting a million calls. They want, they might, they might not have
[00:41:05] time call you back, but they certainly want that call. They certainly want that voicemail. They
[00:41:09] want somebody that's like, my client wants this property, I want to figure out what can we do to
[00:41:13] make this happen? Please, like, you know, I know you're getting a lot of offers. Don't, you know,
[00:41:17] don't let me, you know, follow away. I'm in and then you just keep calling, you know, in a
[00:41:21] polite way, in a way that's respectful and not over the top. But, you know, just little things
[00:41:26] like that, like what you're saying is, you know, make a summary, like that's another thing that
[00:41:30] a lot of people don't do is they just send over the offer and it's like, now I have to read
[00:41:34] through every page and every single thing and look to see if you're trying to sneak something in,
[00:41:38] right? So that makes a lot of sense too. So simple things, but I know Kerry is going to go here in
[00:41:43] just a moment. So I just, we have just one question that I wanted one our team wanted to ask our
[00:41:48] listeners. One is, what should I look for in when I work with a developer? Like, are there red flags
[00:41:55] to look out for? I'm sure you don't say yes to every developer that you get pitched. So what are
[00:41:59] some things to look out for to make me think, oh, maybe this isn't the right match? I think that
[00:42:04] just, you know, as a salesperson and representing a development, you want to make sure that you
[00:42:09] believe in it, right? And you, you know, you like the developer number one, you like the location,
[00:42:17] you like the products. I think that's much easier to sell when you truly believe in the product.
[00:42:22] If you walk into a developer's product and you're like, oh my god, this is so cheap. Here she is
[00:42:28] not going to finish a punch list like they're just like, you know, screw the buyers kind of
[00:42:32] attitude. You do not want to be associated with somebody like that because that is your reputation
[00:42:37] as well, right? You know, you're spending time to promote this development. So just make sure it's
[00:42:41] a product that you believe in and you have a good relationship. Sorry, with the developer that
[00:42:48] he or she is going to follow through on the product. That's great. Well, Kerry has a cold and she
[00:42:54] has been so sweet to to fight through this. This is her still in the first week. You know,
[00:43:00] those nasty colds going around that we all have seemed to got. She's in the middle of that. So
[00:43:03] not again, another, another yay for Kerry and other cheers for Kerry. But again, this isn't the end

But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting REALTOR's for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.

All right, enjoy the episode. Let's get rolling. So I'm going to start with our very first presenter and speaker and also somebody that is very influential here in the Chicago market. Maybe the most influential agent, honestly, as far as single individual agent. I would I say that not just because she's here, but I actually believe it and and Kiki actually would be got on. I don't know if everyone heard this, but she's one of our speakers today too. She's actually going to be getting coached, but she said, oh my gosh, Kerry McCormick, I haven't met you, but I am a huge follower of her. So everyone is a big follower of this of this person of Kerry. So I am so honored to have her. She has been not only an amazing influential person here in Chicago. She's a top, top, top producer, but she has been a huge friend to our show. When I first started the show and didn't have any listeners, Kerry said, I want to be a part of this. And she has been a part of this for as many years as I've had it. So seven years, maybe six, seven years. And she comes on every month. We're so grateful. And she is going to be doing more regular episodes. So she'll be on every month talking about how she grew her business and advice she has for agents. And boy, you know, this is a person that just doesn't have time to do this and she makes time for us. So we're super honored to have her. This is a very important thing, very important person for us here on our show. And we are huge fans of Kerry's. But let me tell you about Kerry McCormick, if you aren't yet familiar, she is by the way with at properties, Christie's International here in Chicago. She is for over two decades. Kerry McCormick has defined, defined excellence in Chicago's real estate market, setting the gold standard across all neighborhoods and price points with an extraordinary career surpassing 2.2 billion in sales, including an impressive 200 million in production alone in 2024. Last year doing 200 million. That is incredible. That was maybe the hardest year. It was the lowest year in 30 years for home sales. And Kerry still crushed 200 million. That's pretty awesome. She's more than a top producer though. She is a first of all a friend to our show. She's a total visionary and leader and just a force to be reckoned with. And also one of the nicest people you could ever meet, honestly. So this is somebody who should have a gigantic ego and she just doesn't. And I think that is something that is really a hallmark of the my favorite people in this industry. Top superstars who are approachable and sweet and kind and Kerry is absolutely all of those things. So I want everybody to follow her specifically on Instagram. Now she is all over social media. We'll have links to all I'll post this soon as we start talking. Rosanna can post her links in the chat. But her Instagram is legendary. She does it all herself too. When you see this, you're not going to believe that she does it all herself. Now, you know, sometimes she has crews filming and stuff for her, but she posted she edits it. She does all the heavy lifting. It is so cool. You won't believe that a single person could do this. It's Kerry McCormick real estate. So we'll have Zana if she is on a can post a link there. If not, I'll do it here in a little bit. We'll have a link to that. And we'll send that out to you as well. So and you can always visit our website, Kerry McCormick real estate.com as well, which is really a cool looking website and really showcases how her her rise in the Chicago line market in the luxury has just been phenomenal. And everybody doesn't only do luxury. Obviously she helps really anyone that she can, but she is really the person that luxury clients go to. She just is she attracts them. She gets them and she's going to talk about that today. All right, Kerry, I'm going to unmute you. Sorry, no, you're on mute. Great. Welcome to the show once again. Thank you. That's such a nice introduction. And I truly appreciate it. And I think one thing that you said is and I appreciate that you said that I'm a nice person. And I think people overlook kindness just in general in this in the world and in our industry. And you know, part of my success is putting ego aside and putting the client first and just being kind, you know, and it takes you a long way. And not everybody is kind. And I've I've asked Kerry this over the years because she's so important here in Chicago. I just assume everybody is super kind and nice to her because she's so kind and nice and she's like, oh no, she's like, you would be shocked at how people talk to me. Other agents talk to me in this business. And I'm just, it blows my mind. So, you know, obviously being kind and nice is really going to be helpful for you. Even if it's just to make better relationships. But agents like closing deals with people they like, that's another thing too. But anyway, Kerry is kind and nice. And also evident doing this today for us. Again, another big thank you to her. All right, Kerry, let's start. I want to start all the way to the beginning. I know this story, but the audience might not. So tell us, you know, you were in a totally different industry. You were in in like the marketing sort of ad world. And you were looking for a change. First of all, let's figure out why. And then how, how did you do that? Yeah. So, I was in marketing. I worked for a company called E-Trade. And this is, you know, going back to the .com boom, where it was the one of the best industries to be in a great company to be in. But I realized, you know, I was a little more rubble spirited than I thought. You know, I just, I don't want to say I'm not a rule follower because it doesn't sound right. But I, I just like, you know, carving my own pathways and, you know, making my own rules kind of, you know, as an entrepreneur, right? And when you work for a company in corporation, there's rules that you have to follow. So again, we're going back to late 1990s, the late 1990s. And I, again, I was working at a great company, had a cushy job, corner office, great views. And I just wasn't fulfilled. You know, it was obviously very young at the time. But I knew that there was something bigger and better out there for me. And again, having that rubble spirited demeanor in me and wanting to be more of an entrepreneur, I had decided to go out for a walk one day. And it was a walk because something was going wrong at the job, at my job, I don't remember what it was, but I was just feeling anxious. I got up and I left the office for a walk. That my office was in the A.N. building. Excuse me. And I ended up walking all the way to the West Loop. Upon my arrival in the West Loop, they were doing construction. And I walked up to the construction site asking what was happening on, you know, we're in the middle of nowhere. And, you know, there's diggers, there's, you know, activity going on, they're building a building. And of course, my curiosity, you know, just led me right to the gentleman, his name was Tom. And I asked him, you know, what were they doing? And excuse me, everyone, I was getting over a cold. And Tom proceeded to let me know that they were building a residential building. And of course, being rubble spirited, I disagreed with Tom. I said, you know, no one's going to live in the West Loop. I don't know why you're even building here. And, you know, we had this nice banter back and forth. And Tom had asked me, you know, are you in real estate? And of course, I said, well, yes, I am. I'm in real estate. And I know what I'm talking about. And, you know, he's, you were not in real estate. But I wasn't real estate. So, Tom said, you know, I'd love to meet with you at my office next week. And we set up a day and time for me to meet with him. Well, of course, I scurried back to my office, realizing that I just fibbed to this gentleman that, you know, I had my real estate, or I was in real estate. So I quickly got online. And I looked up how to get my real estate license. I signed up immediately for the class. When I went to go meet with Tom the following week, I did obviously tell him that I said, Tom, I just want to, you know, tell you the truth. I do not have my license. But I am signed up for the class, you know, so he kind of took that as, you know, appreciated, you know, that I kind of cleared the ear air on that. But I'll say he was completely fine with me. He's like, that's fine. Just finished the class. But I want to talk with you. So we sat down. We, I was at his office for hours and we went through floor plans and we went through different things. And at the end of the meeting, he said, I want to hire you. I want you to run the sales of this new building. And keep in mind, I came from a corporate job where I had, you know, salary benefits, you know, everything that a big corporation would offer somebody. But I knew that this was my opportunity. I knew this was my calling. And I took a leap of faith. And here we are. Yeah, I love that, you know, this, this idea that you can go somewhere and talk to someone and then figure out how to solve the problem of oh gosh, now I have this appointment. And, you know, it's, it's a great thing to take a chance. And you did that. And here you are now all these years later. So let's talk about how you got started. So everyone gets started with zero clients, zero idea of how they're going to survive. And also probably a lot of fear, right? And I know certainly, I talked to new agents almost every day and people who just get their license. And I always ask them, what are you most scared of? Because I always think that's kind of the most interesting thing. And it's usually the one question. It's leads. It's how do I get leads? How do I grow my business? Obviously that is everybody's concerned because leads always love this expression. Uh, Robert Brian Tracy said he goes, um, lead solve all problems. And I think that's pretty true. I don't maybe it's not all problems. But it certainly solves the problem of how to stay in the business. So let's talk about leads. Like how did you when you started? How did you sort of find business? Yeah. So, you know, my career is 25 years and it was split up into two different segments. I call it. So the first decade of my career, I was in development. So just like that story, I worked for the developer and we did that building in the West Loop. And we continued on to several other buildings. And then from there, I was recruited with two, some of the other major developers here in Chicago. So for the first 10 to 12 years of my career, I was on the development side. And I learned a tremendous amount of knowledge and information through that experience. And also keep in mind all of these people that I interacted with for 10 years, right? You know, I'm selling a tower and people were coming into the sales center. I built an incredible database. My career changed in really the pivoting of the 2008 crash, right? So the market crashes in 2008. And that lasts a couple of years. During 08 through, I think it was like 2011-ish. You know, I still worked with the developers because we had to redefine the business and you know, get out of a certain certain things. But then I went into brokerage around 2011-2012. It's hard to even think back that far. And that's where really my development expertise came into place because I had all those leads, right? I had already built 10 plus years of clientele. So I feel like I was lucky that I had a little bit of a head start, but it was still starting from scratch, right? And, you know, networking and having a good CRM and following up with people, just those fundamental attributes of what we do was so important during that time. Yeah, thanks for that. I want to talk about developers because this is something that you, even though you work with, you know, individual home buyers and sellers and not always for the developer, you are chosen to work for developers even today in luxury buildings and all sorts of projects. I live in one of your developments. That's, it's not a small place. And it's funny. The reason I live there, I like Gary so much that I was like, I want to support her because she said, I have this new development. This is four years ago, maybe five years ago. She says, why don't you come check it out? And I was like, okay, I really didn't have any intention of buying anything. And I walked into the showroom and I was like, oh, oh, I want this. And so I happened to live in one of Carrie's developments. So how funny is that? And I, it's, was one of the best purchases I ever made. What a cool development that I get to live in. But Carrie gets chosen for these. And yes, she started her career doing that. But there's a lot of agents that would like to break into that market. It is not an easy market to break into. You are up against some real heavy hitters because of course, developers, they just want their stuff sold for the highest price possible. And they want somebody that really knows what they're doing. But I would love Carrie if you had any advice for somebody who's like, I want to get into development. I want to get to work with developers and get chosen. What are some of the ways that if you were starting over, you might, you know, approach that? Yeah, it's funny when you say starting over, it's just it's such a daunting word to think back, you know, my brain automatically goes back to all of the hard work and the, you know, the road, through, through where I've gotten today. But what developers want is, you know, someone that does have a wide network, right? So to work for these developers, they want you to be able to pick up the phone and call anyone and everybody that you know. So they also want you to be an advocate for that development, right? And for you to believe in that and be able to be more boots on the ground and, you know, get out there and, you know, kind of really be an influencer or a spokesperson for that development. You're the brand and the face of that development. So, you know, again, having deep rooted network, having the social ability to be able to get out and be able to articulate the development and why it's so great. And again, remain focused on that development is super important to them. And you probably, when you worked for developer, initially, you saw probably a lot of REALTORS come through. You probably got to see what good agents who bring in their buyers, you know, good agents, how they show these properties when they're not representing the development. I'm sure you saw a lot of good and bad. And it probably was a great also learning center for you just to see what are the better agents doing. I imagine. I still do that today, you know, even when I go on my showings when I'm with a buyer or obviously, you know, working on the seller side, when agents come in, I'm always learning, right? You always look at other brokers and how they're presenting, how they talk to their clients, how they negotiate. You know, it's a strategy, you know, and you think about, I use it, sports as an analogy quite a bit, right? Because like football, like you study the other teams moves, you study their plays, you know, and as a broker, you know, we're all friendly with each other, but you know, we are competing with each other too. So understanding, you know, how another are competitors work and how they perform really can set you apart too in negotiations and again, just understanding how they work. So it's still, you know, it's an everyday learning curve for me. I'm always paying attention listening, watching and learning. I also wonder too, you know, going back to how to have developers choose you. Again, understanding, you know, being an expert in their development, also making sure that they know you have this wide network and also just being able to show the properties in a way that they want you to show them and be their advocate. There's also this like, well, how do I get in front of developers? Well, Kerry went on a long walk and found one and did that. I've heard of lots of stories like that from other agents. It's not that uncommon, but let's just assume that every developer currently is already working with a top agent. Well, at some point, they might not be happy with that agent, right? Developers are fickle. They're funny. They might blame the agent who they have representing them for things that are unsolved just because the price is too high and agent can't maybe control that. So there's times when agents get replaced, they get moved on or developers like, well, let's see who else is out there. So if I were, you know, again, going out to developers is probably this long process. It's not like you're going to go there, you're going to make your pitch. They're going to go, cool. Here's 20 properties to sell. Like, that's a dream. That's a fantasy that might happen, but probably not. So, Kerry, would you even suggest going to some of these developers and offering to do things kind of almost like unpro bono at the moment or at least saying, let me be your backup in case something goes wrong. Or, you know, how would you approach that if someone already has an agent? Obviously, you don't want to take their business away from the agent. We know that that's a no no. But what could you do to start a relationship with a developer that's already got somebody? Yeah, well, I would say bring the developer some business, you know, because that's what they want. Right? There you go. You know, so you have to always think about what does the developer want? They want the unit sold, right? And you're right. We never want to step on anyone's relationship because I wouldn't want someone to do that to me. So obviously, be respectful of that. But, you know, there's always, you're right. Things always sometimes I shouldn't always, but you know, things sometimes take a turn and the developer needs to hire a backup person and you do want to be that backup person. So communication, staying in touch, providing value when you can. And then obviously bring them a buyer or two or three, you know, they're going to start to see your name again and again and see that you're active in the market, right? And this way, you're giving and not asking for anything. You're giving the developer business, but you're not, you know, right? They're asking. So it's kind of like give, give, give, ask, you know, so that kind of my philosophy is don't always ask for things, but give a few times, and then you can ask. And this is why it's important when you are bringing buyers to make sure that they can close, right? And this has a lot to do with the lender. If it's if it's a non cash offer, this isn't really important thing is you want, if you're going to bring some developer a deal, it really obviously ideally will close. You want that to close. They want it to close. But you also just want them to go, wow, this person knows what they're doing. They get stuff done. Now, obviously things can happen and things might not close. But this is where having a good lender is really, really super important. And good lenders can get deals closed. And so obviously that's something that you want to consider. I want to switch gears a little bit and talk about working with, you know, traditional buyers and sellers, because I know one thing is you win a lot of listings. You do probably more listings. I haven't looked at your data lately, but I'm sure it's more listings than than buy side, although who knows these days. But you do get chosen a lot for listings. And from people who just hear about you who aren't, you know, repeat clients. So, but you're sometimes up against other top agents. You know, somebody selling a several million dollar property, it probably be in their best interest to get a couple of appointments. You're right. So that's just going to happen a lot of the time, even though you might be a referral. So when you're up against another agent, or even if you're not, what are you doing in a listing presentation that you think really helps you win the business? Well, is net top secret there, DJ? Do I really want to tell you all that? No, I'm just joking. You know, you know, I don't know what I do different than other brokers, honestly, like I wish I could sit in another broker's listing presentations, right? But I do know that I try to stay focused on the client through the presentation and what their needs are, right? Because listening to what they want and catering to their needs is obviously the most important. The one thing that I will never do is obviously bad mouth another agent, right? And I know that that's happened to me in the sense of like, I'll be in an interview and those in the clients will say, well, we met with a few other brokers and broker X said this about you. And this broker said that you don't do this or whatever, you know? And so I'm consistently having to combat those comments. So I just think that that's not an appropriate thing to do. And you know, and I always say like, well, I'm so sorry that he or she, you know, feels that way. But let me, you know, give you an app, like, let me have the opportunity to talk to you about that and why that's a concern, maybe a concern of yours. So again, I try to stay focused on the clients. And it's all results driven, right? At the end of the day, a seller just wants their home closed for the most amount of money, right? And they want service. So my job is to show them and tell them how I can provide a high level of service to them, what I do, kind of a play by play. And I also talk to them about my support staff. So one thing that a lot of people don't know about me is that I am an individual agent. I don't have a big team of agents that are out showing. I have the most, what I think the most amazing team support team behind me that helps me remain in the field and remain focused. And I have built my business that way because I feel like that that's, you know, again, giving my clients the best service. And they feel that too because they feel that when I say it's 100% carry that that's what they get. And I, one thing I also know about you is you answer your phone. And, you know, it's, it's, it's funny because we think, well, everybody does, but they don't. Not everybody does. I, I've talked to other top agents who have said the main distinction between me and other agents is I call my clients once a week tell them how things are going. Even if there's no news to report and I answer the phone and they call me and I anticipate their questions ahead of time. I know you do this because obviously you are just so well respected in this industry. And it is results driven, you know, you don't get those big listings or big buyers without having a big track record behind you. I want to share and I'm going to keep this very intentionally vague as to protect the privacy because, but I wanted to share a one way that I've known you've gone above and beyond. And I think this is so cool. I get this very, very vague. But Carrie had a deal at one point that was going to close. It was a very big deal. And it didn't close at the last minute for whatever reason. And you were representing the, the seller. And it didn't close. And it was, this is like a devastating loss. Like it's like, oh my gosh, I can't believe this isn't going to close. It was all the way she had done months and months of work. And it just for whatever reason it just didn't, wasn't going to close. And not her phone. And so she's like, oh my god, I'm going to lose this deal because this client's kind of wacky or whatever. So anyway, she goes, I'm going to, I know I'm going to find a creative solution. And she looks for other properties in the area that basically match what this property offered. And she starts reaching out to the homeowners and saying, I, I have this opportunity for you. I don't know if the buyer is going to be interested. She wasn't representing the buyer, by the way. She's like, I don't know, but I have this person and this deal isn't going to close. Do you have another? Can I can we come and take a look? Now these are homes not on the market. She literally looked for properties. And like, this is how top agents do it. They don't, you know, they lose deals. Everybody does. And then they say, how can I still solve this problem? And she found somebody right away. The person said, sure, I'll be willing to entertain somebody was not looking to sell their home. And then she was able to close that deal. Incredible, right? Now it sounds so simple, but most agents are going to do those kind of things. So I love that you have this creative way of solving problems. And I imagine when you get listings, you often do have to find the buyers, especially in the luxury side, right? Because, you know, we think, well, if we just got a $5 million property, like that's wonderful as a listing agent, but there aren't that many people just waiting for $5 million homes to jump on the market. So you have to actually source the buyer a lot of times too. Isn't that correct? Oh, you're up. You're muted by the way. Sorry. That is correct. And I'm glad that you remember that story because that is part of our job is brokers is to always come up with solutions, right? You know, and I am one if, you know, there's never any problems. There's always, you know, I, if anyone comes to me with a problem, I've always have a solution for them. Everything can be worked out. I love that. What I want to curious to, like when you get luxury listings, it's not always as simple as throwing it on the MLS and making sure there's a cool website for the property. And, you know, it's, it's more than that. You're calling agents who have clients who are in that space and you're saying, hey, I got something you got to come look at. That's something that a lot of listing agents never think to do. Right. No, I mean, it's, it's a different market when you deal with the luxury, you know, just from everything how you handle the listing to marketing the listing to your, your narrative about the home, everything is just very different. I have a question about work life balance because you are so incredibly busy. You don't have this team, even though people probably assume you do because of your production size, like here in Chicago, the agents that do the kind of deals that Kerry does, most of them have these giant production teams. Kerry doesn't have that. She has support teams. She has amazing people on her team, but she's the rainmaker. She's doing the work and she answers the phone and she is busy and she's a mom and she has family and husband and, you know, her own life as well. How do you deal with work life balance? I know that's probably a challenge, but what is it that you do? How do you think about that? Because a lot of agents are going, oh gosh, I hate those 10 p.m. you know, text messages from clients. No, it's tough. I mean, there's no easy, you know, there's no magic solution to it. It's not easy, you know, so I don't want to say there's, I don't even think that there's really a good answer for work life balance, honestly. You know, and yes, I have two older children now, two young adults will call them, you know, and a husband and, you know, extended family and friends and, you know, I do try to segment my time and my day and prioritize, but I feel like I've got such a well-oiled machine and, you know, when I'm with my family, I'm extremely present with my family and, you know, when I work, when I work, I'm the most efficient person at work too, you know, I feel like I can get 10 things done in two minutes, you know, it's just it's just the way that my brain works. So, you know, it works for me, but everyone's got to find their own thing. Yeah, and you are willing to put in a ton of hours, and that is something that is just, if you want to get to the top of the mountain, I don't see another way to that. It's kind of like getting strong in the gym. You're just going to have to put yourself in the pathway of extreme physical pain if you want, so, you know, big muscles, or if you want muscles and you want longevity and you want, you know, good health. It's like, you got to be willing to do the things that most agents aren't willing to do, which is work. And, and I'm not saying most agents don't work, but, but work maybe more effectively, more efficiently plan your day, those kind of things. I want to switch gears and ask about client relationships. So, you work with somebody, you find them home, or sell their home, and then, you know, they're probably not moving for a while. So, what are you doing to stay top of mind or back of mind so that they remember, you know, in seven years, ten years, whenever they need you again, that you're the still the person that they want to reach out to. Yeah, I think, you know, client retention and client outreach is super important. And I think all of us do have a challenge with that because, you know, our job is multi-functional, meaning, you know, we're trying to get business, we're trying to retain our business, we're trying to follow up with clients. There's a lot to it. Obviously, maintaining a good CRM is important. You know, I send out, I've got a list and I try to, you know, when I say try, I really try to, you know, reach out to clients, you know, every gosh, six months, you know, if I see anything on socials, great, if you see if someone's having a baby or a wedding or, you know, anything change in life of reaching out and acknowledging that, I think that's important. Just even mailings, you know, keeping someone in your email or, you know, your, your newsletters is important. I try to do many events every, you know, once or twice a year and invite people to the events as well so we can see each other face to face. What I'd really like to do is to do one-on-one coffee and dinner, but I don't think there's enough time in the world to do all that. But that's one of my goals for this year. Also, I want to talk about having a network of ANSLA, say a Larry, as an American or say that word right, ANSLA Larry, people that you can refer when your clients need a service. It could be everything from a state planning. It could be, you know, attorneys, it could be accountants, it could be people to fix a roof or, you know, people who can redevelop a property or do renovations. So how important is it for you to have that network and how often are your clients reaching out to you going, I need your help. And I assume that's a huge deal for you because if you become that knowledge source, then hopefully they continue to use you. But how important is having that team? No, that's extremely important and it's grown over the last, you know, 20 years of my career. And it's changed because, you know, service providers change as well, right? They're their level of service or if they don't service my clients, I'll move on and find somebody else. So I think I've got a great team of people and but it happens all the time. And just a quick, funny story is a client of mine called me at like 9, 30 or 10 o'clock at night. And of course, I answer the phone because I was a little worried. But they said, oh my gosh, we have a leak, you know, the shower is leaking. It's leaking in our ceiling. I'm thinking like, why would you call me? You know, you know, like I even talked to you in a few months, but, you know, like why would you call me, you know, call a plumber, you know, but it was, you know, I took it as, of course, I helped them. I got them a plumber and we got it taken care of. But it's just, it's funny how that I'm the first person that they call, especially in an emergency, you know, it's like, you need to call the plumber, you need to call, you know, your HVAC person. But, you know, I'm happy to be a resource and, you know, it's, I know people sometimes freak out when things happen. So they are looking for someone to calm them down and, you know, find a solution for them. So I'm happy to do that. But I'm kind of daily the first call of something goes wrong. So I want to ask a question about being a listing agent and receiving offers from buyer agents. Only because I want to know what, you know, you do a lot of listings. What is annoying about receiving offers? In other words, when are there agents that aren't really putting making it easy for you to interpret the offer, to present the offer? And what are agents doing that you're like, think, you know, I love it when I get an offer from this person because they just make it so easy. So I'm curious, like, are there little do's and don'ts when, you know, when you're dealing with, because you want, as a state, as, you know, as a buyer's agent, you want the list agent to like you, you know, it helps do the, well, maybe you don't want them to like you, but I would assume you'd want them to like you. But at least when you're submitting offers, you know, I hear all the time right now, people are saying, gosh, my offers are just getting out bid. I'm not hearing back. You know, so what are, what are some of the things you like to see from the buyer agents when you do get those offers? Well, I think it starts with the showing, honestly, before you're going to make the offer, I think, you know, it's kind of like the pre-interview, right, at the, at the showing. So, you know, if, if a broker's coming in and he or she wants to be very combative during the showing and, you know, start questioning things and if the buyers are, you know, nervous Nellies and they're questioning, you know, the integrity of the home or something, you know, it's kind of like you kind of have a little bit of an idea of the personality that you're going to get with this deal, you know. So, I always think, you know, again, if it's something that you and your client want, try to be on your best behavior, especially with all of the ring doorbells and cameras and people's homes, you know, sellers are watching, you know, if you're going to say something, derogatory or negative about the client's home, you know, just don't say it. You know, so- Wait until you're in your cars. Wait until you're in your car because there's been plenty of times, like my sellers will say, like, oh, I overheard them walking out saying that they hate my, you know, my furniture or something, you know, it's just like, and then we get an offer from them and it's like super awkward. You know, so I think just be on your best behavior during the showings, number one. But just to answer your question, I think when you send an offer over, I think it's really professional practice to call the broker. You know, pick up the phone and call and say, you know, good news. I've got an offer coming in. Let me tell you a little bit about our offer. Have a dialogue, have a conversation. And when you send the offer over, it's great when it's completed. I cannot tell you how many times I get offers that have are they misspell the seller's name. They miss signatures. They ask for, you know, things to be included in the home, but they bury it in the contract. So like, you're kind of like they're trying to sneak it in and then they're summary, they don't list it, you know, and it's just, I think just being thorough. I mean, I feel like that's, is that too much to ask? I mean, we're filling out a contract. So just make sure that it's accurate and things are spelled correctly. You know, it's funny about, about the phone call is I know lots of top agents, and I always ask them, when you get offers with your listings, the agent calls you, right? And they're like, most of the time, no, most agents don't pick up the phone and call, which is shocking because the, and the main reason that I've heard or one of the main reasons that might not occur to people is the other agent is maybe now thinking, if you don't call, how serious are you about this deal? How committed are you to this industry? Right? Like if you're not doing this for your client, what's going to happen 10 days before closing? Like, are you in? Is this, are you in or you not in? So I think that is also just a good reason is the agent is going to be impressed, even though you think I don't want to bother the agent, they're getting a million calls. They want, they might, they might not have time call you back, but they certainly want that call. They certainly want that voicemail. They want somebody that's like, my client wants this property, I want to figure out what can we do to make this happen? Please, like, you know, I know you're getting a lot of offers. Don't, you know, don't let me, you know, follow away. I'm in and then you just keep calling, you know, in a polite way, in a way that's respectful and not over the top. But, you know, just little things like that, like what you're saying is, you know, make a summary, like that's another thing that a lot of people don't do is they just send over the offer and it's like, now I have to read through every page and every single thing and look to see if you're trying to sneak something in, right? So that makes a lot of sense too. So simple things, but I know Kerry is going to go here in just a moment. So I just, we have just one question that I wanted one our team wanted to ask our listeners. One is, what should I look for in when I work with a developer? Like, are there red flags to look out for? I'm sure you don't say yes to every developer that you get pitched. So what are some things to look out for to make me think, oh, maybe this isn't the right match? I think that just, you know, as a salesperson and representing a development, you want to make sure that you believe in it, right? And you, you know, you like the developer number one, you like the location, you like the products. I think that's much easier to sell when you truly believe in the product. If you walk into a developer's product and you're like, oh my god, this is so cheap. Here she is not going to finish a punch list like they're just like, you know, screw the buyers kind of attitude. You do not want to be associated with somebody like that because that is your reputation as well, right? You know, you're spending time to promote this development. So just make sure it's a product that you believe in and you have a good relationship. Sorry, with the developer that he or she is going to follow through on the product. That's great. Well, Kerry has a cold and she has been so sweet to to fight through this. This is her still in the first week. You know, those nasty colds going around that we all have seemed to got. She's in the middle of that. So not again, another, another yay for Kerry and other cheers for Kerry. But again, this isn't the end for her. She's going to be on our show next month. We're going to be doing our monthly episode with Kerry McCormick. She is amazing. It's crowd favorite and a fan favorite. So do her favorite. Follow her on Instagram.

Feel free to sign up for a quick 15 minute meeting with me so I can help you and give you some ideas. I did one of these earlier this morning. And the person had a really interesting question. She was like, I have a bunch of clients. She works with Hispanic clients. She said they're really nervous about deportation right now with the political climate. I was like, oh, that's interesting. I guess that makes sense. So I had I had I had an idea for. And then she also had a question about I can't I can't seem to get myself to do videos, social media videos. So we had an idea of a conversation about how to do that. Kim Ripper, by the way, is coming on in a few hours. She's going to tell you about all about that. But for now, feel free to do that.
