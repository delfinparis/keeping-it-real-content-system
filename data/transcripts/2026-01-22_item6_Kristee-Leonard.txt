[00:01:19] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:23] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:26] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:28] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:31] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:33] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:36] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:37] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:41] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:44] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:46] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:51] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:54] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:56] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:59] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:01] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:02:04] for each agent in your market
[00:02:05] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:09] Not only does it do that,
[00:02:10] but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:13] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:15] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:17] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:20] based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:23] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:25] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:27] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:30] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:32] corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:35] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:38] That's corded.io and now onto the show.
[00:02:56] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Realable,
[00:02:59] largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents.
[00:03:03] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:04] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:06] In just a moment, we're going to be speaking with top producer
[00:03:08] and superstar Christy Leonard.
[00:03:10] Before we get to Christy,
[00:03:11] I'm going to talk about the real estate agent
[00:03:11] 
[00:03:11] 
[00:03:11] 
[00:03:11] 
[00:03:11] 
[00:03:11] that I have an exciting announcement.
[00:03:13] I just created another application
[00:03:15] that I want you guys to test out.
[00:03:16] It's my little gift to you.
[00:03:18] You can go to joincale.com forward slash one hyphen thing.
[00:03:24] So joincale.com forward slash one hyphen thing.
[00:03:27] We'll have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:03:28] What does this link do?
[00:03:29] It is a way for you to supercharge your AI results.
[00:03:32] I talked to so many agents who are not getting the results
[00:03:35] they want with the AI.
[00:03:37] So I basically built a very simple thing.
[00:03:39] It takes 30 seconds to use
[00:03:40] and you will go in and say,
[00:03:41] this is my current biggest problem in my real estate business.
[00:03:44] You will give a little bit of information
[00:03:46] and then you will click generate AI prompt.
[00:03:49] It will generate an AI prompt for you
[00:03:50] that is big and long and you're going to copy and paste that
[00:03:53] into Gemini chat, GPT, Cloud, whichever
[00:03:56] and you're going to get amazing results.
[00:03:59] So I want you to check this out.
[00:04:00] Tell me how it works for you.
[00:04:02] I've been beta testing it right now
[00:04:03] and agents have been loving it.
[00:04:05] So if you're tired of getting bad results
[00:04:07] or just not the results you want from AI,
[00:04:10] this is your solutions totally free.
[00:04:12] My gift to you again, join kale, that's K-A-L-E,
[00:04:15] that's our parent company, join kale.com forward slash one
[00:04:18] hyphen thing, check it out, let me know what you think
[00:04:21] and now under my conversation with Kristi Leonard.
[00:04:41] The best real estate advice I would say is that you don't have
[00:04:44] to be the smartest person in the room.
[00:04:46] You just have to outwork the smartest person in the room.
[00:04:50] And I feel like that's how I grew my career.
[00:04:52] I was willing to do other things that agents weren't
[00:04:55] willing to do.
[00:04:57] I was willing to really work 24, 7, live, eat, and breathe
[00:05:01] real estate.
[00:05:02] And I feel like that has led to my success.
[00:05:05] Worst real estate advice you've received.
[00:05:08] Well, for me personally, it's worked for other people.
[00:05:11] But I remember one of the first calls I had was someone
[00:05:14] they told me to farm a specific area.
[00:05:18] And for me, my business was coming everywhere.
[00:05:21] And if I would have turned down business,
[00:05:25] my business wouldn't have grown.
[00:05:26] If I said, oh, I only worked this neighborhood,
[00:05:30] I can see, like I said, I've seen it work for other agents.
[00:05:33] But for me personally, I was of the mindset of,
[00:05:37] if I have the time in the day, I'm going to take the rental,
[00:05:41] I'm going to take the lead out in Gerald.
[00:05:43] I'm going to go as far as I can go to do as much business
[00:05:47] as I can.
[00:05:49] Yeah, I love that.
[00:05:50] We're going to dive into that in just a few minutes.
[00:05:55] But today, our guest is Kristi Leonard.

[00:06:49] Welcome, Kristi.
[00:06:51] Thank you for having me.
[00:06:53] I'm really excited to talk to you
[00:06:55] because you have a particular energy to you
[00:06:59] that I think is fun and really uplifting.
[00:07:04] My first interview of the year for the 2026.
[00:07:07] So that is always a special interview for me.
[00:07:11] And you've just have a real positive energy to you.
[00:07:14] So let's talk about you.
[00:07:17] Let's go all the way back.
[00:07:18] How did you get into Real Estate?
[00:07:21] Absolutely.
[00:07:22] So how I got into Real Estate is when my parents got divorced,
[00:07:27] my mom did not have a college degree.
[00:07:29] And so Real Estate was really one of her only options
[00:07:33] to try to sustain the same lifestyle that she had.
[00:07:37] So I went to Real Estate classes with my mom
[00:07:40] before I went off to college
[00:07:42] and just kind of like emotional support.
[00:07:45] We were doing it together.
[00:07:46] I went to college and then I also studied abroad.
[00:07:51] And when I got back from studying abroad,
[00:07:53] I was just kind of like tired and over college.
[00:07:56] And I also wanted to help my mom.
[00:07:58] So I moved from Florida back to Austin,
[00:08:03] got my Real Estate license.
[00:08:04] So I finished the classes and got my license.
[00:08:06] And I flew to Florida for my tests.
[00:08:09] And I saw Real Estate at the same time.
[00:08:12] This was my last semester of college.
[00:08:14] You were selling Real Estate in college?
[00:08:17] Yes.
[00:08:18] My senior year.
[00:08:21] Would everybody else was working at the local bar
[00:08:25] or working these menial jobs,
[00:08:28] you were out there closing deals?
[00:08:31] Yes.
[00:08:32] Well, and the thing is is like,
[00:08:33] I feel like what has also led to my success
[00:08:36] is failure was not an option.
[00:08:39] So when my parents got divorced,
[00:08:41] my mom always had helped my dad with his businesses.
[00:08:45] He was an entrepreneur.
[00:08:47] But she didn't really have any background herself.
[00:08:51] And so when she got into Real Estate,
[00:08:54] literally it was like a complete 180.
[00:08:57] She didn't know if she was gonna make the mortgage payment.
[00:09:00] Life had changed completely.
[00:09:02] So for me, I was like, I have to make it.
[00:09:07] Like there is no option but to make it,
[00:09:09] which I feel like was the greatest blessing.
[00:09:13] Because I've hired agents in the past
[00:09:16] where I feel like if you have your parents to fall back on,
[00:09:20] then that's not really setting you up for success.
[00:09:23] You really have to not have any sort of safety nut.
[00:09:27] I feel like you don't have any backup.
[00:09:30] I've heard it referred to as the gift of desperation.
[00:09:34] That's exactly the gift of desperation
[00:09:37] that I am actually so thankful for
[00:09:39] because that is what I attribute to my success.
[00:09:43] But that's how I got into Real Estate
[00:09:45] was not that I always grew up knowing
[00:09:47] this is what I wanna do.
[00:09:49] It was more just to help my mom.
[00:09:52] And actually after I graduated,
[00:09:56] I wanted to feel like I was using my degree.
[00:09:59] So I went into day trading
[00:10:01] and I worked at Kirschner Trading for a little while.
[00:10:05] And that gave me a whole new appreciation for Real Estate
[00:10:09] because I realized that was not my calling.
[00:10:12] And so I went back to focusing 100% on Real Estate
[00:10:16] and that's when things really started to take off.
[00:10:19] And I didn't know that it was my calling
[00:10:21] but it is absolutely my calling
[00:10:23] and what I will be doing the rest of my life.
[00:10:27] I don't see myself switching careers.
[00:10:29] Wow, well, we have a huge trading
[00:10:34] sort of industry here in Chicago as well.
[00:10:37] We have a mercantile exchange
[00:10:39] and there's a lot of day traders here
[00:10:41] and that is a rough job, definitely a rough job.
[00:10:46] But why did you decide to return back to Real Estate?
[00:10:50] Because I knew quickly.
[00:10:51] So I wanted to, I gave day trading about six months.
[00:10:56] I wanted to give it a go
[00:10:58] and see if it was something I was interested in.
[00:11:01] And I realized that it wasn't a fit for me.
[00:11:04] There were gentlemen there that did amazing
[00:11:07] and the sky was the limit just like it is in Real Estate.
[00:11:10] But for me personally, I felt like it was gambling.
[00:11:13] It just didn't, like it wasn't what I was born to do.
[00:11:17] So that's what made me get back into Real Estate.
[00:11:20] And when I got back into Real Estate
[00:11:22] because initially when I got into Real Estate,
[00:11:24] it was, I wanted to be there to help my mom.
[00:11:27] And then once I graduated, it was like,
[00:11:30] well, I want to figure out what my calling is.
[00:11:32] And then after trying day trading,
[00:11:34] I was like, okay, Real Estate is my calling.
[00:11:36] And then I gave it, you know, everything.
[00:11:41] It's truly an amazing story
[00:11:42] and you've just kept going, going, going, going
[00:11:46] and really achieving a lot in a very short amount of time.
[00:11:50] I want to talk about how do you think about your day?
[00:11:55] So I always think, you know, we interview
[00:11:57] these amazing producers on the show
[00:11:59] and it always starts with the day.
[00:12:01] So walk us through a day in the life of Christie Leonard.
[00:12:05] Well, I wish my days, so I have gone
[00:12:08] through different structures of my day.
[00:12:10] Before COVID, I was getting up really early.
[00:12:14] So for example, I would have agents that would reply back
[00:12:18] to me and say, Christie, are we farmers?
[00:12:19] Because I'm like emailing them at four o'clock in the morning.
[00:12:23] And I had this really rigid schedule.
[00:12:26] And then I felt like during the pandemic,
[00:12:28] I would have, you know, everybody's lives was upside down
[00:12:32] and clients were wanting to do offers again
[00:12:34] at like 11 o'clock at night
[00:12:35] and things were just all over the place.
[00:12:37] So I felt like I didn't really have a schedule.
[00:12:41] Now as far as my schedule is concerned,
[00:12:43] I like going to bed early and waking up early,
[00:12:46] but as you know, we've got to be there for our clients.
[00:12:50] If our client wants to make an offer at 11,
[00:12:53] you know, where they are making, or at least I am,
[00:12:55] I have no boundaries.
[00:12:57] I am there making the offer at 11.
[00:13:00] So yes, but my perfect day would be to go to bed early,
[00:13:04] to wake up early because you always feel like,
[00:13:06] I feel like when you're getting up earlier
[00:13:08] than everybody else, it removes the chaos
[00:13:11] because you just feel like you're starting your day
[00:13:13] ahead of time to tackle everything
[00:13:16] whereas sometimes if you're just entering into the chaos
[00:13:20] then it feels like you're constantly behind.
[00:13:23] But real estate is not, you know, every day is different
[00:13:26] and I don't have, I know that some agents are like,
[00:13:29] okay, I do my seller updates on Monday
[00:13:32] and I do this on Tuesday and I do this on Wednesday.
[00:13:36] And unfortunately, I don't have, I would say like,
[00:13:40] what my clients like about me is that they can like today,
[00:13:45] I had a client text me and say, hey, can I get into this property
[00:13:49] and you know, I'm Johnny on the spot like, yes, you can.
[00:13:52] I'll get in there after this closing,
[00:13:55] not like, oh, well today I have this structured.
[00:13:58] Right.
[00:13:59] So you're more flexible.
[00:14:01] So that's my day's like, yeah,
[00:14:02] I mean, to give you an example, like today,
[00:14:04] I had a closing, I've been had a showing after the closing,
[00:14:08] I met with some other clients
[00:14:09] and showed them a couple properties.
[00:14:11] So my day's very, really,
[00:14:14] and I wish I could say I had more structure,
[00:14:17] but you know, one thing Tom Ferry said,
[00:14:19] I recently had gone to a conference,
[00:14:21] he said buyers want convenience
[00:14:24] and sellers want a track record.
[00:14:27] So if you're working with buyers,
[00:14:29] they don't even care, they should,
[00:14:32] but they don't always necessarily care
[00:14:34] that I have 18 years in the business,
[00:14:36] they wanna get in this house right now, you know?
[00:14:39] So I hope that's helpful.
[00:14:42] No, that is super helpful because you know,
[00:14:44] when we want groceries,
[00:14:46] we can tap on our phones,
[00:14:48] when we want a lift to, you know,
[00:14:51] a downtown event, we can just call up Uber
[00:14:55] and we want things, when we want them,
[00:14:58] we want them quickly and real estate
[00:15:01] sort of falls into that category,
[00:15:03] even though it's not a quick transaction,
[00:15:05] but the idea of seeing real estate, you know,
[00:15:08] is kind of a fast moving,
[00:15:10] or fast-paced moving,
[00:15:14] sort of process these days.
[00:15:15] So I think you're right.
[00:15:17] This idea of being super flexible and malleable
[00:15:20] to be able to react quickly
[00:15:22] is really important these days.
[00:15:25] I talked to a lot of,
[00:15:26] I talked to senior leadership over at Zillow quite often,
[00:15:29] and I always asked them like,
[00:15:31] who are the agents that do the best with your leads?
[00:15:33] And they say, oh, the ones that pick up the phone
[00:15:35] and when we live transfer,
[00:15:38] they immediately set the appointment.
[00:15:39] So what's interesting is, you know,
[00:15:42] this person tells out the form and clicks,
[00:15:45] you know, I want to see it and then they live transfer it
[00:15:48] and then the person on the other end,
[00:15:51] just literally is like, okay, when are we going to go see this?
[00:15:52] I was like, the first thing they do
[00:15:54] before they even introduce themselves.
[00:15:56] And it's like, why don't they introduce themselves first?
[00:15:59] Oh, because the person already knows what they want.
[00:16:02] Yes, you will introduce yourself.
[00:16:03] Yes, you'll go through a hole.
[00:16:05] Here's what I am and here's why I am great.
[00:16:08] But you have to sort of address their need
[00:16:11] and you seem like somebody who is really good
[00:16:13] at being reactive to, you know,
[00:16:16] to your client's needs.
[00:16:20] Yes, I try to be.
[00:16:23] Yeah, let's talk.
[00:16:25] What would you say is your superpower?
[00:16:27] Like what would your clients say is your superpower?
[00:16:31] I would say, my clients always say
[00:16:34] that I have like an old fashioned work ethic.
[00:16:37] They always say that.
[00:16:39] I think that they always say, does Christy ever sleep?
[00:16:43] I don't know that like my attributes are something
[00:16:47] that is necessarily what people want to follow,
[00:16:50] but they appreciate that I am responsive seven days a week.
[00:16:55] They appreciate my thoroughness and my diligence
[00:17:00] and my response time.
[00:17:03] I know that a lot of people are trying
[00:17:06] to get a work life balance and that is not something
[00:17:09] that I have achieved yet in my real estate career.
[00:17:12] Well, I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of agents
[00:17:15] who are at the very top of the mountain all across the country
[00:17:18] and all of them say there is no such thing
[00:17:21] as work life balance.
[00:17:22] But we strive for it.
[00:17:25] We want to, we want it, but balance isn't just not possible.
[00:17:29] It doesn't mean your life has to be chaos,
[00:17:31] but it's certainly, if you want a certain level of success,
[00:17:35] you're going to work for it and you are the obvious,
[00:17:39] you know, the example here because you outwork people.
[00:17:43] Tell us what you mean when you say you outwork other agents.
[00:17:47] Oh, on multiple levels.
[00:17:49] I mean, you're not going to call my phone
[00:17:51] and hear that I like, you know, a lot of recordings
[00:17:54] are like, I'm not working on Sunday
[00:17:56] or I don't answer my phone past seven.
[00:17:59] You're not going to get that with me.
[00:18:02] The last three times, so my pretty much most
[00:18:05] of my real estate career, I didn't even want to go on vacation
[00:18:07] because I wanted to be here working,
[00:18:10] but recently I've made more of an effort
[00:18:12] to just do little weekend trips.
[00:18:15] And the last three times I went to California,
[00:18:16] I executed a deal each time.
[00:18:18] And one of them was on my 40th birthday.
[00:18:22] And my dad was like, oh, I feel bad.
[00:18:23] You're working on your 40th birthday.
[00:18:25] And I'm like, no, this is like a present to me
[00:18:28] because I'm paying for this trip.
[00:18:30] I'm getting, you know, a deal.
[00:18:32] I can take the time to write an offer.
[00:18:35] And I find that to be actually very exciting.
[00:18:37] I don't look at it as like, oh, I'm inconvenienced.
[00:18:40] I'm working on vacation.
[00:18:41] I'm like, oh, I just got a present during vacation.
[00:18:44] It almost seems to you to be like an honor
[00:18:47] to be able to work this profession.
[00:18:49] Oh, absolutely.
[00:18:51] Yes.
[00:18:52] I am very thankful that my clients choose me
[00:18:55] and that I get the repeat business and loyalty
[00:18:58] that I get from them.
[00:19:00] I don't take that for granted.
[00:19:01] I think I was looking on the Texas Real Estate Commission website
[00:19:04] and just for Travis County alone,
[00:19:07] there were over 33,000 licenses in Travis County
[00:19:10] for agents and brokers.
[00:19:13] And I'm like, okay, you know, out of that many
[00:19:15] for someone to choose you, it is an honor.
[00:19:18] It truly is.
[00:19:19] And that's a great, great, great point.
[00:19:22] And you treat them like they're an honor.
[00:19:26] And that's, and people can feel that, right?
[00:19:28] I think people really can feel that
[00:19:30] when you work with a service person
[00:19:33] and you can tell their into their job.
[00:19:36] And they appreciate that you are the customer.
[00:19:38] And I think that mentality, you certainly have it.
[00:19:42] A lot of the people I've interviewed on the show have it.
[00:19:44] Pretty much everyone has it on the show.
[00:19:47] And I love that it's just being into the job,
[00:19:49] being kind of into it is one of the biggest like tips
[00:19:54] I can give people.
[00:19:55] It's kind of an intangible thing.
[00:19:57] Not to, it's hard to sort of talk about,
[00:20:00] but it's like this idea of just like, I'm in fully in.
[00:20:04] Well, and now that you say that actually one thing
[00:20:06] I do want to focus on is if you're going to take it client,
[00:20:10] you need to give them, you're all,
[00:20:13] it shouldn't be like, oh, well, this is just a rental
[00:20:15] or oh, this is just a $200,000 property.
[00:20:18] If you choose to take on that client,
[00:20:21] then you need to represent them just like
[00:20:23] if they were a multimillion dollar deal.
[00:20:25] And that really I feel like is how I run my business.
[00:20:29] That if I'm not going to be able to do that,
[00:20:31] then I shouldn't be taking on the client.
[00:20:34] Let's talk about standards because you have very high standards
[00:20:37] for yourself.
[00:20:39] So tell us a little bit about what you expect of yourself
[00:20:42] with your clients.
[00:20:45] Oh my goodness, as far as my standards with my clients,
[00:20:49] I would say, you know,
[00:20:51] I, for me, it's very, very important to have a quick,
[00:20:56] like right before I got on this,
[00:20:58] I was texting my clients saying like,
[00:21:00] hey, I'm going to be a bit unavailable during this timeframe
[00:21:03] because they really, they are used to Christy
[00:21:06] like responding back to them within seconds.
[00:21:09] So I would say response time is very, very important to me,
[00:21:14] but I'm also very thorough throughout the whole process.
[00:21:18] So, you know, I have checklists.
[00:21:20] I actually do not have a contract to close person.
[00:21:24] I like to do the contract to close
[00:21:26] because there are a lot of things
[00:21:27] that I catch during the contract to close
[00:21:30] that I feel are important.
[00:21:32] And so really I feel like the service that I give my clients
[00:21:36] is more, I consider myself a real estate advisor.
[00:21:40] I don't consider myself just another REALTOR.
[00:21:44] So I'll give you an example.
[00:21:46] I had a property that had, it had sold multiple times.
[00:21:51] Well, when my clients bought it,
[00:21:53] we discovered that the water heater was not permit.
[00:21:56] I mean, not the water heater.
[00:21:57] The septic system had not,
[00:22:00] the permit had not been finalized.
[00:22:02] Well, that had already been through multiple transactions
[00:22:05] that nobody caught, you know?
[00:22:08] And so it's just really, I feel like setting the bar
[00:22:11] of just, not just being a transaction
[00:22:14] but being very detailed throughout the transaction
[00:22:18] like you are an advisor, you know?
[00:22:21] So I would say that's how, how I run my business
[00:22:24] is just having, I feel like the knowledge that I have
[00:22:27] and the experience that I have sets me apart
[00:22:32] from other REALTORS and just being more detailed
[00:22:34] in the process.
[00:22:36] Yeah, yeah, I think that's absolutely true.
[00:22:40] And we can see that now you run a brokerage now.
[00:22:44] So how do you devote sort of time to your own business
[00:22:48] and also growing your team?
[00:22:51] Yeah, so I have been a broker since 2010
[00:22:55] and I always knew, and at that time,
[00:22:58] you only had to be licensed two years
[00:23:00] before you could get your brokerage license
[00:23:02] and a lot of my college counted towards credit towards it.
[00:23:07] So I just innately knew once I hit that to your mark,
[00:23:10] I'm gonna get my brokerage license.
[00:23:12] Whether I stayed at the brokerage I was at or not,
[00:23:15] that was always something that I wanted to do.
[00:23:18] And I was generating my business
[00:23:20] and so I didn't really feel like there was a need
[00:23:23] for me to stay at the brokerage.
[00:23:24] The only thing was that people would say,
[00:23:27] oh, you're at the number one brokerage in Austin
[00:23:30] and so to be able to use that in listing appointments
[00:23:33] and things like that.
[00:23:35] But really, my business went from being an agent
[00:23:38] that was doing like three million a year
[00:23:40] to my best year, I did over 50 individually.
[00:23:44] And so that had, being an independent broker had no effect.
[00:23:48] I feel like people care more about the actual person
[00:23:50] who's representing them than what the brokerage name is
[00:23:53] or that has been my experience.
[00:23:56] As far as running my real estate day to day
[00:23:59] throughout my career, I have brought other agents on.
[00:24:03] But if you run the numbers,
[00:24:05] you have to have a lot of agents for the split
[00:24:09] to make sense where you're bringing in the income
[00:24:11] that you could bring in just on your own.
[00:24:14] And personally, I feel like management is not my gift.
[00:24:19] And I think it's also important just to recognize your gifts
[00:24:22] because the trajectory that a lot of people are on
[00:24:26] is that you are to build a team.
[00:24:29] But that is not my calling and that's not where I feel like
[00:24:35] I'm going to thrive.
[00:24:36] There are actually some individual agents
[00:24:38] that have structures kind of like more of a business
[00:24:41] where they have showing agents that show their properties
[00:24:45] but they solely, they're not focused on their own business.
[00:24:49] They're just solely working for that individual agent.
[00:24:53] That is more my style as far as like what I see
[00:24:57] for my future.
[00:24:58] I don't see myself growing a team.
[00:25:01] And really at one point I thought,
[00:25:03] okay, I'll work actively in the business
[00:25:06] and then when I'm ready to be more passive,
[00:25:09] then I will grow a brokerage.
[00:25:12] And honestly, I just don't even think that I think I've pivoted
[00:25:17] in what my goals are.
[00:25:19] And I don't think that I want to grow a brokerage
[00:25:22] because I really feel like I'd have to have at least
[00:25:25] 100 agents to make it make sense.
[00:25:28] And that I just realized in working in real estate
[00:25:31] what I enjoy.
[00:25:33] And I think that's something that's important is
[00:25:36] you don't necessarily have to be on the same path
[00:25:40] that everybody's on.
[00:25:42] What is best for you and what do you enjoy?
[00:25:45] So my path, what I see myself is,
[00:25:48] like I said, my best year I did over 50.
[00:25:51] You know, I could see myself being an agent
[00:25:53] that's doing 100, 200,
[00:25:56] but more on an individual agent type structure
[00:25:59] instead of a team structure.
[00:26:01] So that's kind of where I see my business going.
[00:26:04] I still enjoy meeting with clients.
[00:26:06] I still enjoy going on listing presentations.
[00:26:10] So that's where I'm at right now.
[00:26:13] I love that.
[00:26:14] So you have figured out through managing an office,
[00:26:18] through, you know, thinking about
[00:26:20] maybe I should have my own team.
[00:26:22] And your own efforts, like I really like the one-to-one,
[00:26:27] you know, this relationship.
[00:26:29] I like working directly with buyers, directly with sellers.
[00:26:32] That's my thing.
[00:26:33] I'm good at it.
[00:26:34] It pumps me up.
[00:26:36] It's what I'm best at.
[00:26:37] And you're gonna lean into that and step on the gas.
[00:26:40] So, and by the way,
[00:26:43] you've tried a lot of things as well, right?
[00:26:46] So, well, I want to talk about that a little bit
[00:26:49] because you will pick up opportunities
[00:26:51] that a lot of agents will, you know, maybe just pass on by.
[00:26:55] So talk a little bit about some of that.
[00:26:58] Yes, absolutely.
[00:27:00] So one thing I've gone through different niches in my career,
[00:27:04] but one thing to hone in on is that
[00:27:08] I think that it's important if you are a new agent
[00:27:11] in the business to really work anything that comes your way
[00:27:15] within your level of comfort.
[00:27:17] Obviously, they say, you know, don't work areas
[00:27:20] that you're not familiar with,
[00:27:21] but within your level of comfort
[00:27:22] and what your broker can assist you with,
[00:27:25] I think that it's important to one-work rentals,
[00:27:30] whether it be on the list side or the tenant side,
[00:27:32] I have one client where that rental,
[00:27:35] they came here from California,
[00:27:37] they were looking at a rental that was like $3,000 a month
[00:27:41] and I've sold over $4 million to that client,
[00:27:44] you know, just because I worked that rental.
[00:27:46] And the thing, too, is the year I was selling over $50 million,
[00:27:50] I was working rentals.
[00:27:52] So I think that as long as you have the time and the day,
[00:27:56] it's really no different than taking someone to coffee
[00:27:59] or to lunch, you're building a relationship
[00:28:02] and you don't know where that relationship can go.
[00:28:04] They might, even if they didn't buy a home,
[00:28:07] they might have someone that they would refer to you.
[00:28:10] So I think that it is important
[00:28:11] because one thing I have noticed in working with newer agents
[00:28:15] just even here in my area is they'll say,
[00:28:17] oh, well, I only work central Austin.
[00:28:20] And I'm like, I would love to only work central Austin, too,
[00:28:23] but you don't have that luxury.
[00:28:25] Like, if you want to succeed,
[00:28:27] you need to be willing to do everything.
[00:28:29] And then obviously, if you get to a point
[00:28:31] where you can be selective
[00:28:33] because you have so much business, that's great.
[00:28:36] But I think it's really important
[00:28:38] to just work everything that you can.
[00:28:42] Yeah, let's talk about your brand.
[00:28:44] So tell me about when you think about your brand,
[00:28:46] what comes to mind?
[00:28:48] Okay, when I think about my brand,
[00:28:51] I think luxury.
[00:28:53] But that is one thing that I actually have.
[00:28:56] I often have to correct people
[00:28:58] because I will have potential leads or clients
[00:29:02] that think, oh, Christie's not going to work this.
[00:29:05] And I say, no, I will work everything.
[00:29:07] Like last year, I think my sales,
[00:29:10] I had some a condo at 200,000
[00:29:13] and then a home sell at 4 million.
[00:29:15] So if I have the time, I work it across the board.
[00:29:18] But in my presentation, you're, of course,
[00:29:21] nobody should be doing this,
[00:29:22] but you're not going to be seeing iPhone photos.
[00:29:24] You know, everything is going to be professional photography.
[00:29:28] But I feel like I also just take it to another level
[00:29:31] because it's not just a matter of what is the minimum level
[00:29:35] of service I can provide.
[00:29:37] If you follow, you know, go to my Instagram, follow it.
[00:29:40] A lot of my content is a professional videographer
[00:29:43] that's doing it, trying to stay trendy in a head.
[00:29:48] And as far as, you know, the marketing that I prepare
[00:29:51] for my clients, it's really just trying to come across
[00:29:55] first class.
[00:29:57] You know, I want from the flyers to the photos,
[00:30:01] to the 3D tours and the videos and everything.
[00:30:04] I want everything to look professional
[00:30:07] because ultimately that is my brand.
[00:30:09] And every, in every client that I work
[00:30:11] and every marketing piece, it's just, for me,
[00:30:15] it's important to come across as professional
[00:30:18] and well put together.
[00:30:20] Yeah, and you have a very consistent brand
[00:30:24] and a very high end brand, why should I say a luxury brand?
[00:30:30] And how have you found that works in the way of referral?
[00:30:35] So what part of your business is you going out
[00:30:38] finding business versus clients referring to you?
[00:30:41] Absolutely.
[00:30:42] So most of my business is repeat clients and referrals,
[00:30:46] but I'm glad speaking to the brand,
[00:30:48] I on Instagram, I used to make more of an effort
[00:30:52] to target other REALTORS on Instagram,
[00:30:55] then to try to target buyers or sellers
[00:30:58] because I knew that if a REALTOR was referring it to me,
[00:31:01] that that was already a hot lead.
[00:31:03] They already knew the person, they were ready to go.
[00:31:07] You weren't having, you know, a lot of times
[00:31:08] people get these leads from Facebook
[00:31:10] and it's like, oh great, you're getting hundreds of leads
[00:31:12] that you have to call who knows who's going to buy.
[00:31:15] Wait, let's slow this down because I want to hear this
[00:31:18] because this is really interesting.
[00:31:20] So you're talking about getting B to B leads, basically.
[00:31:25] How do I get leads?
[00:31:26] You're getting leads from other agents on social media.
[00:31:30] Tell us about that.
[00:31:31] Yes.
[00:31:32] So when I first kind of started my social media,
[00:31:35] a lot of times if you follow people, they will follow you back.
[00:31:39] Now Instagram limits how many times you can do that
[00:31:42] and they'll start cutting you off.
[00:31:44] But I would follow other REALTORS and then innately,
[00:31:48] they would follow me back.
[00:31:50] So just to give some examples,
[00:31:53] there's a REALTOR, she has a really great social media
[00:31:56] present she's actually pivoted from real estate now.
[00:32:00] But she's in Houston, her name's Julia Wang.
[00:32:03] And she found me on Instagram through, at that time,
[00:32:08] she was just searching luxury, REALTOR Austin,
[00:32:11] something like that, it came up, I popped up.
[00:32:14] And we still have never met to this day,
[00:32:17] but she brought me a waterfront listing on like Travis
[00:32:21] because she found me on Instagram.
[00:32:23] So that was more organic.
[00:32:26] I had not connected with her yet.
[00:32:28] She found me through searching on Instagram.
[00:32:30] But I also have just been connected with agents
[00:32:34] who see my content over and over again.
[00:32:37] I had a REALTOR in my own market
[00:32:41] who she felt like she was not a luxury REALTOR
[00:32:44] and her sister wanted to sell her luxury home,
[00:32:47] her and her husband.
[00:32:48] And so she actually referred her home sister to me
[00:32:52] for a referral fee when she was in the market.
[00:32:55] She could have sold it herself,
[00:32:56] but she felt like my branding was luxury branding
[00:33:01] and she wanted a luxury REALTOR.
[00:33:04] So there have been several instances like that
[00:33:06] where I've generated business from Instagram,
[00:33:10] both organically and then trying to target other REALTOR's
[00:33:14] as far as one thing I haven't done,
[00:33:17] but I know a lot of people are doing is they're trying
[00:33:20] to just generate conversations.
[00:33:22] People will just message other accounts
[00:33:25] and start trying to connect with them
[00:33:28] and generate a relationship with them.
[00:33:33] Yeah, it's very interesting.
[00:33:36] I wanna talk about social media.
[00:33:37] So how do you approach social media
[00:33:40] and what kind of content do you like to push out there?
[00:33:45] Absolutely.
[00:33:46] So a lot of my content that I'm pushing out on social media
[00:33:51] are my own listings.
[00:33:52] So I feel like other REALTOR's can appreciate
[00:33:55] and see how I am marketing my listings.
[00:33:58] So they know if they refer a client to me,
[00:34:01] what I'm gonna be doing
[00:34:02] and how I'm gonna be working for them
[00:34:04] and for their referral client.
[00:34:07] I think there's a lot of room for improvement
[00:34:10] on my Instagram.
[00:34:11] I don't do a whole lot of educational
[00:34:14] which would be more targeting a buyer or seller.
[00:34:17] And I know a lot of agents do home tours,
[00:34:20] the tours that I'm doing are my own listings.
[00:34:24] But again, this kind of goes back to my strategy
[00:34:26] of honing more on REALTOR's
[00:34:29] than actually buyer and seller leads
[00:34:31] because the REALTOR's are seeing
[00:34:34] and appreciating how I market for my clients.
[00:34:37] That's really interesting.
[00:34:38] So you almost go after REALTOR's
[00:34:41] more than the consumers themselves.
[00:34:44] Yes, I do.
[00:34:45] I think that in the future,
[00:34:47] I could see myself adding on to my marketing strategy.
[00:34:51] But initially when I got into Instagram,
[00:34:53] I felt like I'm not one where I want to sit around
[00:34:57] and call 100 leads.
[00:34:59] I want to know, you know,
[00:35:00] whoever comes to me is ready to buy our sell.
[00:35:02] And so I felt like I would have a better chance of that
[00:35:06] coming from a REALTOR.
[00:35:08] That's really interesting.
[00:35:11] I think you're probably the first person
[00:35:12] in 700 episodes that has ever really gone
[00:35:15] that particular path.
[00:35:17] It's kind of blowing my mind.
[00:35:20] So the idea is you want to be the person
[00:35:23] that they refer to because your brand is so solid,
[00:35:27] is so tight and it's so luxury.
[00:35:33] They're going to have just an amazing experience.
[00:35:36] Yes, I actually, one thing I just thought of,
[00:35:40] I REALTOR out of Hawaii,
[00:35:42] I sold, she had a property here.
[00:35:45] Now this was not on the luxury,
[00:35:46] it was a rental property she had here.
[00:35:49] But again, you know, she just was seeing
[00:35:51] how I was marketing homes.
[00:35:52] And so she wanted me to list her own property.
[00:35:57] Wow.
[00:35:59] No.
[00:36:00] That is wild.
[00:36:02] So yeah, so let's talk about how you go about, you know,
[00:36:08] finding business.
[00:36:09] So let's, and I know you've been in the business
[00:36:11] now a long time, so you get a lot of repeat clients.
[00:36:13] But if you were, if we picked you up
[00:36:16] and we put you in a different town
[00:36:18] where you didn't know anyone and you weren't,
[00:36:21] you know, you didn't grow up there,
[00:36:23] what would you do to start generating business?
[00:36:26] Okay, well, one thing that I could definitely improve on
[00:36:29] but that I want to share, so there's this REALTOR
[00:36:32] in my market who was holding open houses at my listings.
[00:36:36] And she's only been in the business a few years.
[00:36:38] From one of my listings, she sold a $5 million home.
[00:36:42] From another one of my listings,
[00:36:44] she sold a $3.5 million home.
[00:36:47] And these buyers didn't buy my listing,
[00:36:49] but she got the lead.
[00:36:51] And so that's one thing I feel like,
[00:36:54] agents need to get back into the basics.
[00:36:57] Yes.
[00:36:57] Open houses are a huge opportunity.
[00:37:02] And so if I were to go into a new market,
[00:37:05] I would say I would heavily focus on open houses
[00:37:08] which is so basic, but that is something
[00:37:10] that I was really mind blown
[00:37:12] because whenever I hold an open house,
[00:37:14] it's for my seller and my mentality.
[00:37:18] And a lot of times too, I have so much business
[00:37:20] that my mentality has always been,
[00:37:23] I'm trying to sell that home for my client.
[00:37:26] Not what clients can I get out of this.
[00:37:28] Sure.
[00:37:29] Because I'm the listing agent.
[00:37:30] It's a different mentality.
[00:37:32] When I was talking to her, she said,
[00:37:33] Christine, I actually think I get more leads
[00:37:36] on the homes that are not my listings
[00:37:39] that I'm holding open versus when I hold open my own listings
[00:37:43] because she thinks that also there's just a different
[00:37:46] rapport with the buyer that comes in.
[00:37:49] And there might be a little bit more of a shield.
[00:37:52] I think that's right.
[00:37:55] That's interesting because when somebody comes in
[00:37:57] and they don't feel like, hey, this isn't my place,
[00:38:00] I'm not selling this.
[00:38:02] There's a casualness, there's a comfort there.
[00:38:06] There's like, hey, I'm just here.
[00:38:07] I'm kind of just here.
[00:38:09] And I think that breaks down some barriers maybe
[00:38:12] and makes people feel comfortable.
[00:38:15] Absolutely.
[00:38:17] So that's something, if I were to go to a new market,
[00:38:19] I think that there are people out there.
[00:38:22] It's all a matter of getting back to what we said
[00:38:25] in the beginning and really being someone
[00:38:27] that's going to outwork your competition.
[00:38:29] I have REALTORS that reach out to me
[00:38:31] to hold my listings open and they're doing
[00:38:33] multiple open houses in a day.
[00:38:35] Well, let me tell you, those agents are going to be successful
[00:38:38] because they're willing to put in the work.
[00:38:40] You know, it's the agents that don't want to hold open houses
[00:38:43] and don't want to work and want everything to fall
[00:38:46] into their lap.
[00:38:47] You know, that's what makes a difference.
[00:38:49] So I don't think it's about you really have to like,
[00:38:52] think outside the box here.
[00:38:54] You just have to get back to the basics, but do the basics.
[00:38:58] And if you didn't have listings,
[00:38:59] you would just go up to somebody who has listings
[00:39:02] like you or people do this to you now
[00:39:05] and go, please let me do an open house for you.
[00:39:09] Absolutely.
[00:39:09] Yes, I have so many agents that reach out to me
[00:39:11] about that.
[00:39:12] But you know, I have a relative friend in California
[00:39:16] and I feel like door knocking is more prevalent
[00:39:19] there.
[00:39:19] It's not as prevalent here in Austin.
[00:39:23] Maybe it's more welcomed there.
[00:39:25] But you know, she will go the door knock
[00:39:28] if they have a buyer looking in the neighborhood.
[00:39:31] And then that actually can that can turn into a seller,
[00:39:34] you know, just by creating that relationship.
[00:39:38] Yeah, I interviewed somebody in California.
[00:39:40] This is really interesting who used to work in entertainment.
[00:39:44] He was works as a production person for movies.
[00:39:49] And he did it for 15 years and he became a REALTOR.
[00:39:52] And I said, oh, you must have got all your business
[00:39:54] from the entertainment industry that you work with.
[00:39:57] He goes, no, no.
[00:39:58] None of those people ended up using me as a REALTOR.
[00:40:01] I just kind of start over and I said, oh, well, how did you do it?
[00:40:04] He said, I would go to homes that I really thought were super cool.
[00:40:08] And I would walk to the, you know, to a house.
[00:40:11] I would knock on the door.
[00:40:13] I would, I was dressed in a suit.
[00:40:15] And he said, I, I would know a lot about the house
[00:40:18] and I would see if the owner was home.
[00:40:20] And I would say, I am such a fan of this house.
[00:40:23] I know you're probably not looking to sell or buy,
[00:40:26] you know, buy, move anytime soon.
[00:40:28] But when you are, could you please let me know
[00:40:32] because I want an opportunity to try to either bring you a buyer
[00:40:36] or maybe even list this property for you
[00:40:38] like this is a dream house for me.
[00:40:40] And he would just know things about it.
[00:40:43] He was like a fan.
[00:40:43] He would basically go up to these luxury homes
[00:40:46] and say, I am such a fan of this house.
[00:40:48] I know things about it.
[00:40:49] Tell me about it.
[00:40:50] Tell me the story of this house.
[00:40:52] And he said it was the smartest thing he ever did.
[00:40:55] He was from Canada.
[00:40:56] And he would knock on the door.
[00:40:58] And I imagine if somebody came to your door and said,
[00:41:00] oh my God, I love your property.
[00:41:02] Like you would be so flattered, right?
[00:41:05] So there are ways to do this that aren't creepy or weird
[00:41:08] or you know, you're going to get a gun, you know,
[00:41:12] greeting you at the door.
[00:41:14] But that's what he does.
[00:41:15] He would door knock and that's how he built his business.
[00:41:18] Well, and when you were saying that,
[00:41:20] I think something that's so important is sellers
[00:41:23] want someone who's excited about their home.
[00:41:26] I will say that's actually something
[00:41:27] that I have struggled with recently
[00:41:29] because I feel like most markets saw a shift,
[00:41:33] you know, when interest rates change.
[00:41:35] And I have to, I don't go into a listing appointment
[00:41:41] sugar-coating things, you know,
[00:41:43] I'm not going to take an overpriced listing.
[00:41:47] And so when I go in there recently,
[00:41:49] I feel like in my appointments,
[00:41:51] I've been very matter of the fact
[00:41:55] when it comes to like where the market is,
[00:41:58] where the pricing is,
[00:41:59] and just setting realistic expectations,
[00:42:01] I don't want to over promise an under-deliver.
[00:42:04] And sometimes that can lead to kind of a seller feeling
[00:42:08] like there's a lack of enthusiasm about their property.
[00:42:13] So I think that's a really good point that you made
[00:42:15] that I think innately sellers really want to fill
[00:42:19] like the person who is representing their property
[00:42:22] is excited about it and passionate about it.
[00:42:25] So that's a great strategy that he's using.
[00:42:28] Yeah, I agree.
[00:42:29] I was really unique and I thought that that was really cool.
[00:42:32] And you should be into the home that you're listed.
[00:42:35] You should think it's cool, you know?
[00:42:37] Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:38] Yeah, and I bet you sort of work the same way as well.
[00:42:43] Let's talk a little bit about sort of the future for you.
[00:42:48] So how do you see yourself continuing to evolve as a REALTOR?
[00:42:53] Absolutely.
[00:42:54] So I'm sure there are several of us like better listening.
[00:42:57] If you've been in the market a while,
[00:42:59] you might have been I guess a little,
[00:43:03] I don't know what the right word is.
[00:43:04] I don't think discourages the right word,
[00:43:06] but after 2022 things changed.
[00:43:10] And I in my real estate career every year was always better
[00:43:14] than the previous year.
[00:43:16] And then after 2022, myself went down.
[00:43:20] And I kind of I've always been very goal oriented
[00:43:24] and had goals for myself, but after that,
[00:43:28] after around that timeframe,
[00:43:30] I kind of stopped having goals.
[00:43:32] I was a little burnt out.
[00:43:35] And I really was just passively working my business.
[00:43:40] Still working very hard, but I didn't,
[00:43:43] I felt like it was like whatever came in,
[00:43:46] you know, there wasn't there wasn't a goal up there
[00:43:48] that I was trying to achieve.
[00:43:50] And that's really where I am trying to shift my focus now
[00:43:55] is I want to beat my best year and I want to grow.
[00:44:00] And for me, I'm not props to anybody
[00:44:03] that wants to sell 300 homes in a year, that's great,
[00:44:06] but my goal is not for that.
[00:44:09] My goal is to increase my overall sales volume,
[00:44:14] but try to maintain, I think I'm comfortable
[00:44:17] around like 60 deals a year.
[00:44:19] So for me, obviously what that means
[00:44:21] is just like increasing the average sales price.
[00:44:25] But I want to get more, I'm very good
[00:44:28] about marketing my own listings
[00:44:29] and really trying to find, always trying to serve the client
[00:44:34] and know what the new thing is out there for marketing.
[00:44:38] For example, like when Zillow Showcase listings came out,
[00:44:41] you know, trying to be in like on Realtor.com,
[00:44:44] you can boost the listing, trying to know everything
[00:44:47] that's out there for a seller to market a seller's property.
[00:44:51] So my marketing has always been focusing on my listings,
[00:44:55] not focusing on marketing myself, per se.
[00:45:00] And also, you know, I know, for example,
[00:45:02] with postcards you have to be consistent
[00:45:04] and I was not consistent with that.
[00:45:06] But where I'm going in the future is I have a lot
[00:45:11] of repeat business and referrals.
[00:45:13] Last year my repeat business and referrals was like
[00:45:16] probably 90 to 95%.
[00:45:19] It's primarily that.
[00:45:20] And so going into the future and how I see growing my business
[00:45:24] is really being more strategic on growing my lead source
[00:45:30] instead of passively working it.
[00:45:33] I mean, I feel like I get calls almost daily of,
[00:45:37] oh, hey, Kristi, my rental, I don't want to renew my rental,
[00:45:40] I want to sell it or this or that.
[00:45:42] So I get a lot of, I'm very good at having
[00:45:45] my repeat business and loyalty.
[00:45:47] But I do want to be more strategic in trying
[00:45:52] to generate new business.
[00:45:53] So that's where I see myself.
[00:45:55] And really I feel like my target goal is,
[00:45:59] well, I want to reach 100 million,
[00:46:01] but then I can see myself trying to keep on beating that.
[00:46:06] But that's kind of like a new target.
[00:46:08] Amazing.
[00:46:10] What is hard for you right now?
[00:46:13] Well, I would say one of my flaws is for the longest time,
[00:46:17] I feel like I have to do everything myself.
[00:46:20] And you have to scale your business.
[00:46:23] You cannot do everything.
[00:46:25] And that kind of goes back to when agents would be like,
[00:46:27] what are we farmers?
[00:46:28] Because I'd be emailing at four o'clock in the morning
[00:46:30] or I'd be posting like on Facebook my listing at like one a.m.
[00:46:35] You know, I was just doing everything.
[00:46:37] And so I got a virtual assistant probably back in 2021
[00:46:42] around that time frame.
[00:46:43] And that was the best thing that ever happened to me.
[00:46:46] My virtual assistant is amazing.
[00:46:48] He went back to school.
[00:46:49] So I have a new virtual assistant who I've had for a while.
[00:46:53] He's been amazing.
[00:46:54] But I feel like a lot of agents in not just in real estate
[00:46:58] across the board and businesses, you know, like my brother,
[00:47:00] he's an entrepreneur and he has multiple VAs.
[00:47:04] A lot of people are getting multiple VAs.
[00:47:06] And then there's companies that are training the VAs
[00:47:09] specifically for real estate.
[00:47:12] I have a friend 30 under 30 and he has a business where
[00:47:17] he now has a VA business and they train them specifically
[00:47:20] for real estate.
[00:47:22] But yeah, I would say, you know, that's one of the best things
[00:47:26] in my business is getting a VA.
[00:47:29] But then I need to be better about scaling.
[00:47:32] But I feel like that looks different for me than for other agents.
[00:47:36] What do you have your VA do?
[00:47:39] Okay, so my VA he does all my email flyers.
[00:47:43] I approve everything.
[00:47:46] But so in constant contact, he goes in and he creates
[00:47:49] all my email flyers.
[00:47:51] He creates my email flyers and Frazier flyers,
[00:47:54] which is a company that sends out flyers to REALTORS.
[00:47:58] He creates all the reverse prospecting databases to email.
[00:48:03] So we create the reverse prospecting for the listing
[00:48:05] and then email them about open houses, price reductions.
[00:48:09] We generate a database of neighbors for a listing
[00:48:14] and he adds that to constant contact.
[00:48:18] So rather than, you know, I know the strategy can be show up
[00:48:21] to the open house early and door knock the closest 10 homes.
[00:48:25] We email a wider radius of neighbors and invite them to the open house.
[00:48:32] So I feel like that's more effective than just knocking on 10 doors.
[00:48:36] He does all my social media posting.
[00:48:39] So for example, if I have a new listing, he generates the post.
[00:48:43] He sends it to me for approval and then he's copy and pasting it
[00:48:47] across the platforms.
[00:48:48] I'm the one who's always posting on my stories.
[00:48:52] So it's still a lot of engagement from me.
[00:48:54] I would never hire a company that just does like these generated,
[00:48:59] you know, a post that they do on every single REALTOR.
[00:49:02] I wanted to be very personal.
[00:49:04] And then also I know some agents or friends of mine
[00:49:08] that they will only post certain things on their Instagram and they tell the seller
[00:49:12] like, oh, I'll post yours on Facebook.
[00:49:15] I post all my stuff.
[00:49:16] So it's not like a consistent luxury branding in the sense that I'm posting
[00:49:20] all my properties at all price points.
[00:49:23] But then we also delete things like after they've sold just to kind of clean
[00:49:28] up the Instagram.
[00:49:30] But he's so he's doing all my social media.
[00:49:32] I just asked him to put together a listing presentation for me.
[00:49:36] He's going to do an updated buyer presentation for me.
[00:49:39] Just really anything that I would have put on the back burner.
[00:49:44] He is helping me to accomplish that.
[00:49:48] I love that.
[00:49:49] And Christy, we should mention that you are in Austin, which of course is a place
[00:49:54] where people, you know, Texas is one of those states these days where people
[00:49:59] are traveling to their, their migrating to their retiring to.
[00:50:04] And, you know, Austin is one of those places in Texas where they land.
[00:50:09] So we have a lot of listeners out there and they would love to connect with you.
[00:50:14] And we talked about referrals earlier.
[00:50:17] So tell us a little bit about, you know, how they should connect with you.
[00:50:20] If one of our audience members has a buyer or seller that might be a good fit for you.
[00:50:25] Absolutely.
[00:50:26] Whatever is easiest for them, they can message me on
[00:50:29] Instagram.
[00:50:30] They can text me.
[00:50:31] They can call me.
[00:50:32] My number is 512 695 5144.
[00:50:36] They can email me.
[00:50:38] Christy at theleadersreality.com.
[00:50:40] I would be honored to work with your client.
[00:50:43] And I would want it to come back to you and make you look wonderful.
[00:50:46] So I would work extra hard for them.
[00:50:48] But that would be amazing.
[00:50:50] Also, if anybody wants to reach out to me because they have a question,
[00:50:54] I am all about collaboration over competition.
[00:50:57] So if you know me, I am answering calls and questions from REALTORS and just really trying to help each other out.

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.

The best real estate advice I would say is that you don't have to be the smartest person in the room. You just have to outwork the smartest person in the room. And I feel like that's how I grew my career. I was willing to do other things that agents weren't willing to do. I was willing to really work 24, 7, live, eat, and breathe real estate. And I feel like that has led to my success. Worst real estate advice you've received. Well, for me personally, it's worked for other people. But I remember one of the first calls I had was someone they told me to farm a specific area. And for me, my business was coming everywhere. And if I would have turned down business, my business wouldn't have grown. If I said, oh, I only worked this neighborhood, I can see, like I said, I've seen it work for other agents. But for me personally, I was of the mindset of, if I have the time in the day, I'm going to take the rental, I'm going to take the lead out in Gerald. I'm going to go as far as I can go to do as much business as I can. Yeah, I love that. We're going to dive into that in just a few minutes. But today, our guest is Kristi Leonard.

We will have links to that in the show notes. Welcome, Kristi. Thank you for having me. I'm really excited to talk to you because you have a particular energy to you that I think is fun and really uplifting. My first interview of the year for the 2026. So that is always a special interview for me. And you've just have a real positive energy to you. So let's talk about you. Let's go all the way back. How did you get into Real Estate? Absolutely. So how I got into Real Estate is when my parents got divorced, my mom did not have a college degree. And so Real Estate was really one of her only options to try to sustain the same lifestyle that she had. So I went to Real Estate classes with my mom before I went off to college and just kind of like emotional support. We were doing it together. I went to college and then I also studied abroad. And when I got back from studying abroad, I was just kind of like tired and over college. And I also wanted to help my mom. So I moved from Florida back to Austin, got my Real Estate license. So I finished the classes and got my license. And I flew to Florida for my tests. And I saw Real Estate at the same time. This was my last semester of college. You were selling Real Estate in college? Yes. My senior year. Would everybody else was working at the local bar or working these menial jobs, you were out there closing deals? Yes. Well, and the thing is is like, I feel like what has also led to my success is failure was not an option. So when my parents got divorced, my mom always had helped my dad with his businesses. He was an entrepreneur. But she didn't really have any background herself. And so when she got into Real Estate, literally it was like a complete 180. She didn't know if she was gonna make the mortgage payment. Life had changed completely. So for me, I was like, I have to make it. Like there is no option but to make it, which I feel like was the greatest blessing. Because I've hired agents in the past where I feel like if you have your parents to fall back on, then that's not really setting you up for success. You really have to not have any sort of safety nut. I feel like you don't have any backup. I've heard it referred to as the gift of desperation. That's exactly the gift of desperation that I am actually so thankful for because that is what I attribute to my success. But that's how I got into Real Estate was not that I always grew up knowing this is what I wanna do. It was more just to help my mom. And actually after I graduated, I wanted to feel like I was using my degree. So I went into day trading and I worked at Kirschner Trading for a little while. And that gave me a whole new appreciation for Real Estate because I realized that was not my calling. And so I went back to focusing 100% on Real Estate and that's when things really started to take off. And I didn't know that it was my calling but it is absolutely my calling and what I will be doing the rest of my life. I don't see myself switching careers. Wow, well, we have a huge trading sort of industry here in Chicago as well. We have a mercantile exchange and there's a lot of day traders here and that is a rough job, definitely a rough job. But why did you decide to return back to Real Estate? Because I knew quickly. So I wanted to, I gave day trading about six months. I wanted to give it a go and see if it was something I was interested in. And I realized that it wasn't a fit for me. There were gentlemen there that did amazing and the sky was the limit just like it is in Real Estate. But for me personally, I felt like it was gambling. It just didn't, like it wasn't what I was born to do. So that's what made me get back into Real Estate. And when I got back into Real Estate because initially when I got into Real Estate, it was, I wanted to be there to help my mom. And then once I graduated, it was like, well, I want to figure out what my calling is. And then after trying day trading, I was like, okay, Real Estate is my calling. And then I gave it, you know, everything. It's truly an amazing story and you've just kept going, going, going, going and really achieving a lot in a very short amount of time. I want to talk about how do you think about your day? So I always think, you know, we interview these amazing producers on the show and it always starts with the day. So walk us through a day in the life of Christie Leonard. Well, I wish my days, so I have gone through different structures of my day. Before COVID, I was getting up really early. So for example, I would have agents that would reply back to me and say, Christie, are we farmers? Because I'm like emailing them at four o'clock in the morning. And I had this really rigid schedule. And then I felt like during the pandemic, I would have, you know, everybody's lives was upside down and clients were wanting to do offers again at like 11 o'clock at night and things were just all over the place. So I felt like I didn't really have a schedule. Now as far as my schedule is concerned, I like going to bed early and waking up early, but as you know, we've got to be there for our clients. If our client wants to make an offer at 11, you know, where they are making, or at least I am, I have no boundaries. I am there making the offer at 11. So yes, but my perfect day would be to go to bed early, to wake up early because you always feel like, I feel like when you're getting up earlier than everybody else, it removes the chaos because you just feel like you're starting your day ahead of time to tackle everything whereas sometimes if you're just entering into the chaos then it feels like you're constantly behind. But real estate is not, you know, every day is different and I don't have, I know that some agents are like, okay, I do my seller updates on Monday and I do this on Tuesday and I do this on Wednesday. And unfortunately, I don't have, I would say like, what my clients like about me is that they can like today, I had a client text me and say, hey, can I get into this property and you know, I'm Johnny on the spot like, yes, you can. I'll get in there after this closing, not like, oh, well today I have this structured. Right. So you're more flexible. So that's my day's like, yeah, I mean, to give you an example, like today, I had a closing, I've been had a showing after the closing, I met with some other clients and showed them a couple properties. So my day's very, really, and I wish I could say I had more structure, but you know, one thing Tom Ferry said, I recently had gone to a conference, he said buyers want convenience and sellers want a track record. So if you're working with buyers, they don't even care, they should, but they don't always necessarily care that I have 18 years in the business, they wanna get in this house right now, you know? So I hope that's helpful. No, that is super helpful because you know, when we want groceries, we can tap on our phones, when we want a lift to, you know, a downtown event, we can just call up Uber and we want things, when we want them, we want them quickly and real estate sort of falls into that category, even though it's not a quick transaction, but the idea of seeing real estate, you know, is kind of a fast moving, or fast-paced moving, sort of process these days. So I think you're right. This idea of being super flexible and malleable to be able to react quickly is really important these days. I talked to a lot of, I talked to senior leadership over at Zillow quite often, and I always asked them like, who are the agents that do the best with your leads? And they say, oh, the ones that pick up the phone and when we live transfer, they immediately set the appointment. So what's interesting is, you know, this person tells out the form and clicks, you know, I want to see it and then they live transfer it and then the person on the other end, just literally is like, okay, when are we going to go see this? I was like, the first thing they do before they even introduce themselves. And it's like, why don't they introduce themselves first? Oh, because the person already knows what they want. Yes, you will introduce yourself. Yes, you'll go through a hole. Here's what I am and here's why I am great. But you have to sort of address their need and you seem like somebody who is really good at being reactive to, you know, to your client's needs. Yes, I try to be. Yeah, let's talk. What would you say is your superpower? Like what would your clients say is your superpower? I would say, my clients always say that I have like an old fashioned work ethic. They always say that. I think that they always say, does Christy ever sleep? I don't know that like my attributes are something that is necessarily what people want to follow, but they appreciate that I am responsive seven days a week. They appreciate my thoroughness and my diligence and my response time. I know that a lot of people are trying to get a work life balance and that is not something that I have achieved yet in my real estate career. Well, I've interviewed hundreds and hundreds of agents who are at the very top of the mountain all across the country and all of them say there is no such thing as work life balance. But we strive for it. We want to, we want it, but balance isn't just not possible. It doesn't mean your life has to be chaos, but it's certainly, if you want a certain level of success, you're going to work for it and you are the obvious, you know, the example here because you outwork people. Tell us what you mean when you say you outwork other agents. Oh, on multiple levels. I mean, you're not going to call my phone and hear that I like, you know, a lot of recordings are like, I'm not working on Sunday or I don't answer my phone past seven. You're not going to get that with me. The last three times, so my pretty much most of my real estate career, I didn't even want to go on vacation because I wanted to be here working, but recently I've made more of an effort to just do little weekend trips. And the last three times I went to California, I executed a deal each time. And one of them was on my 40th birthday. And my dad was like, oh, I feel bad. You're working on your 40th birthday. And I'm like, no, this is like a present to me because I'm paying for this trip. I'm getting, you know, a deal. I can take the time to write an offer. And I find that to be actually very exciting. I don't look at it as like, oh, I'm inconvenienced. I'm working on vacation. I'm like, oh, I just got a present during vacation. It almost seems to you to be like an honor to be able to work this profession. Oh, absolutely. Yes. I am very thankful that my clients choose me and that I get the repeat business and loyalty that I get from them. I don't take that for granted. I think I was looking on the Texas Real Estate Commission website and just for Travis County alone, there were over 33,000 licenses in Travis County for agents and brokers. And I'm like, okay, you know, out of that many for someone to choose you, it is an honor. It truly is. And that's a great, great, great point. And you treat them like they're an honor. And that's, and people can feel that, right? I think people really can feel that when you work with a service person and you can tell their into their job. And they appreciate that you are the customer. And I think that mentality, you certainly have it. A lot of the people I've interviewed on the show have it. Pretty much everyone has it on the show. And I love that it's just being into the job, being kind of into it is one of the biggest like tips I can give people. It's kind of an intangible thing. Not to, it's hard to sort of talk about, but it's like this idea of just like, I'm in fully in. Well, and now that you say that actually one thing I do want to focus on is if you're going to take it client, you need to give them, you're all, it shouldn't be like, oh, well, this is just a rental or oh, this is just a $200,000 property. If you choose to take on that client, then you need to represent them just like if they were a multimillion dollar deal. And that really I feel like is how I run my business. That if I'm not going to be able to do that, then I shouldn't be taking on the client. Let's talk about standards because you have very high standards for yourself. So tell us a little bit about what you expect of yourself with your clients. Oh my goodness, as far as my standards with my clients, I would say, you know, I, for me, it's very, very important to have a quick, like right before I got on this, I was texting my clients saying like, hey, I'm going to be a bit unavailable during this timeframe because they really, they are used to Christy like responding back to them within seconds. So I would say response time is very, very important to me, but I'm also very thorough throughout the whole process. So, you know, I have checklists. I actually do not have a contract to close person. I like to do the contract to close because there are a lot of things that I catch during the contract to close that I feel are important. And so really I feel like the service that I give my clients is more, I consider myself a real estate advisor. I don't consider myself just another REALTOR. So I'll give you an example. I had a property that had, it had sold multiple times. Well, when my clients bought it, we discovered that the water heater was not permit. I mean, not the water heater. The septic system had not, the permit had not been finalized. Well, that had already been through multiple transactions that nobody caught, you know? And so it's just really, I feel like setting the bar of just, not just being a transaction but being very detailed throughout the transaction like you are an advisor, you know? So I would say that's how, how I run my business is just having, I feel like the knowledge that I have and the experience that I have sets me apart from other REALTORS and just being more detailed in the process. Yeah, yeah, I think that's absolutely true. And we can see that now you run a brokerage now. So how do you devote sort of time to your own business and also growing your team? Yeah, so I have been a broker since 2010 and I always knew, and at that time, you only had to be licensed two years before you could get your brokerage license and a lot of my college counted towards credit towards it. So I just innately knew once I hit that to your mark, I'm gonna get my brokerage license. Whether I stayed at the brokerage I was at or not, that was always something that I wanted to do. And I was generating my business and so I didn't really feel like there was a need for me to stay at the brokerage. The only thing was that people would say, oh, you're at the number one brokerage in Austin and so to be able to use that in listing appointments and things like that. But really, my business went from being an agent that was doing like three million a year to my best year, I did over 50 individually. And so that had, being an independent broker had no effect. I feel like people care more about the actual person who's representing them than what the brokerage name is or that has been my experience. As far as running my real estate day to day throughout my career, I have brought other agents on. But if you run the numbers, you have to have a lot of agents for the split to make sense where you're bringing in the income that you could bring in just on your own. And personally, I feel like management is not my gift. And I think it's also important just to recognize your gifts because the trajectory that a lot of people are on is that you are to build a team. But that is not my calling and that's not where I feel like I'm going to thrive. There are actually some individual agents that have structures kind of like more of a business where they have showing agents that show their properties but they solely, they're not focused on their own business. They're just solely working for that individual agent. That is more my style as far as like what I see for my future. I don't see myself growing a team. And really at one point I thought, okay, I'll work actively in the business and then when I'm ready to be more passive, then I will grow a brokerage. And honestly, I just don't even think that I think I've pivoted in what my goals are. And I don't think that I want to grow a brokerage because I really feel like I'd have to have at least 100 agents to make it make sense. And that I just realized in working in real estate what I enjoy. And I think that's something that's important is you don't necessarily have to be on the same path that everybody's on. What is best for you and what do you enjoy? So my path, what I see myself is, like I said, my best year I did over 50. You know, I could see myself being an agent that's doing 100, 200, but more on an individual agent type structure instead of a team structure. So that's kind of where I see my business going. I still enjoy meeting with clients. I still enjoy going on listing presentations. So that's where I'm at right now. I love that. So you have figured out through managing an office, through, you know, thinking about maybe I should have my own team. And your own efforts, like I really like the one-to-one, you know, this relationship. I like working directly with buyers, directly with sellers. That's my thing. I'm good at it. It pumps me up. It's what I'm best at. And you're gonna lean into that and step on the gas. So, and by the way, you've tried a lot of things as well, right? So, well, I want to talk about that a little bit because you will pick up opportunities that a lot of agents will, you know, maybe just pass on by. So talk a little bit about some of that. Yes, absolutely. So one thing I've gone through different niches in my career, but one thing to hone in on is that I think that it's important if you are a new agent in the business to really work anything that comes your way within your level of comfort. Obviously, they say, you know, don't work areas that you're not familiar with, but within your level of comfort and what your broker can assist you with, I think that it's important to one-work rentals, whether it be on the list side or the tenant side, I have one client where that rental, they came here from California, they were looking at a rental that was like $3,000 a month and I've sold over $4 million to that client, you know, just because I worked that rental. And the thing, too, is the year I was selling over $50 million, I was working rentals. So I think that as long as you have the time and the day, it's really no different than taking someone to coffee or to lunch, you're building a relationship and you don't know where that relationship can go. They might, even if they didn't buy a home, they might have someone that they would refer to you. So I think that it is important because one thing I have noticed in working with newer agents just even here in my area is they'll say, oh, well, I only work central Austin. And I'm like, I would love to only work central Austin, too, but you don't have that luxury. Like, if you want to succeed, you need to be willing to do everything. And then obviously, if you get to a point where you can be selective because you have so much business, that's great. But I think it's really important to just work everything that you can. Yeah, let's talk about your brand. So tell me about when you think about your brand, what comes to mind? Okay, when I think about my brand, I think luxury. But that is one thing that I actually have. I often have to correct people because I will have potential leads or clients that think, oh, Christie's not going to work this. And I say, no, I will work everything. Like last year, I think my sales, I had some a condo at 200,000 and then a home sell at 4 million. So if I have the time, I work it across the board. But in my presentation, you're, of course, nobody should be doing this, but you're not going to be seeing iPhone photos. You know, everything is going to be professional photography. But I feel like I also just take it to another level because it's not just a matter of what is the minimum level of service I can provide. If you follow, you know, go to my Instagram, follow it. A lot of my content is a professional videographer that's doing it, trying to stay trendy in a head. And as far as, you know, the marketing that I prepare for my clients, it's really just trying to come across first class. You know, I want from the flyers to the photos, to the 3D tours and the videos and everything. I want everything to look professional because ultimately that is my brand. And every, in every client that I work and every marketing piece, it's just, for me, it's important to come across as professional and well put together. Yeah, and you have a very consistent brand and a very high end brand, why should I say a luxury brand? And how have you found that works in the way of referral? So what part of your business is you going out finding business versus clients referring to you? Absolutely. So most of my business is repeat clients and referrals, but I'm glad speaking to the brand, I on Instagram, I used to make more of an effort to target other REALTORS on Instagram, then to try to target buyers or sellers because I knew that if a REALTOR was referring it to me, that that was already a hot lead. They already knew the person, they were ready to go. You weren't having, you know, a lot of times people get these leads from Facebook and it's like, oh great, you're getting hundreds of leads that you have to call who knows who's going to buy. Wait, let's slow this down because I want to hear this because this is really interesting. So you're talking about getting B to B leads, basically. How do I get leads? You're getting leads from other agents on social media. Tell us about that. Yes. So when I first kind of started my social media, a lot of times if you follow people, they will follow you back. Now Instagram limits how many times you can do that and they'll start cutting you off. But I would follow other REALTORS and then innately, they would follow me back. So just to give some examples, there's a REALTOR, she has a really great social media present she's actually pivoted from real estate now. But she's in Houston, her name's Julia Wang. And she found me on Instagram through, at that time, she was just searching luxury, REALTOR Austin, something like that, it came up, I popped up. And we still have never met to this day, but she brought me a waterfront listing on like Travis because she found me on Instagram. So that was more organic. I had not connected with her yet. She found me through searching on Instagram. But I also have just been connected with agents who see my content over and over again. I had a REALTOR in my own market who she felt like she was not a luxury REALTOR and her sister wanted to sell her luxury home, her and her husband. And so she actually referred her home sister to me for a referral fee when she was in the market. She could have sold it herself, but she felt like my branding was luxury branding and she wanted a luxury REALTOR. So there have been several instances like that where I've generated business from Instagram, both organically and then trying to target other REALTOR's as far as one thing I haven't done, but I know a lot of people are doing is they're trying to just generate conversations. People will just message other accounts and start trying to connect with them and generate a relationship with them. Yeah, it's very interesting. I wanna talk about social media. So how do you approach social media and what kind of content do you like to push out there? Absolutely. So a lot of my content that I'm pushing out on social media are my own listings. So I feel like other REALTOR's can appreciate and see how I am marketing my listings. So they know if they refer a client to me, what I'm gonna be doing and how I'm gonna be working for them and for their referral client. I think there's a lot of room for improvement on my Instagram. I don't do a whole lot of educational which would be more targeting a buyer or seller. And I know a lot of agents do home tours, the tours that I'm doing are my own listings. But again, this kind of goes back to my strategy of honing more on REALTOR's than actually buyer and seller leads because the REALTOR's are seeing and appreciating how I market for my clients. That's really interesting. So you almost go after REALTOR's more than the consumers themselves. Yes, I do. I think that in the future, I could see myself adding on to my marketing strategy. But initially when I got into Instagram, I felt like I'm not one where I want to sit around and call 100 leads. I want to know, you know, whoever comes to me is ready to buy our sell. And so I felt like I would have a better chance of that coming from a REALTOR. That's really interesting. I think you're probably the first person in 700 episodes that has ever really gone that particular path. It's kind of blowing my mind. So the idea is you want to be the person that they refer to because your brand is so solid, is so tight and it's so luxury. They're going to have just an amazing experience. Yes, I actually, one thing I just thought of, I REALTOR out of Hawaii, I sold, she had a property here. Now this was not on the luxury, it was a rental property she had here. But again, you know, she just was seeing how I was marketing homes. And so she wanted me to list her own property. Wow. No. That is wild. So yeah, so let's talk about how you go about, you know, finding business. So let's, and I know you've been in the business now a long time, so you get a lot of repeat clients. But if you were, if we picked you up and we put you in a different town where you didn't know anyone and you weren't, you know, you didn't grow up there, what would you do to start generating business? Okay, well, one thing that I could definitely improve on but that I want to share, so there's this REALTOR in my market who was holding open houses at my listings. And she's only been in the business a few years. From one of my listings, she sold a $5 million home. From another one of my listings, she sold a $3.5 million home. And these buyers didn't buy my listing, but she got the lead. And so that's one thing I feel like, agents need to get back into the basics. Yes. Open houses are a huge opportunity. And so if I were to go into a new market, I would say I would heavily focus on open houses which is so basic, but that is something that I was really mind blown because whenever I hold an open house, it's for my seller and my mentality. And a lot of times too, I have so much business that my mentality has always been, I'm trying to sell that home for my client. Not what clients can I get out of this. Sure. Because I'm the listing agent. It's a different mentality. When I was talking to her, she said, Christine, I actually think I get more leads on the homes that are not my listings that I'm holding open versus when I hold open my own listings because she thinks that also there's just a different rapport with the buyer that comes in. And there might be a little bit more of a shield. I think that's right. That's interesting because when somebody comes in and they don't feel like, hey, this isn't my place, I'm not selling this. There's a casualness, there's a comfort there. There's like, hey, I'm just here. I'm kind of just here. And I think that breaks down some barriers maybe and makes people feel comfortable. Absolutely. So that's something, if I were to go to a new market, I think that there are people out there. It's all a matter of getting back to what we said in the beginning and really being someone that's going to outwork your competition. I have REALTORS that reach out to me to hold my listings open and they're doing multiple open houses in a day. Well, let me tell you, those agents are going to be successful because they're willing to put in the work. You know, it's the agents that don't want to hold open houses and don't want to work and want everything to fall into their lap. You know, that's what makes a difference. So I don't think it's about you really have to like, think outside the box here. You just have to get back to the basics, but do the basics. And if you didn't have listings, you would just go up to somebody who has listings like you or people do this to you now and go, please let me do an open house for you. Absolutely. Yes, I have so many agents that reach out to me about that. But you know, I have a relative friend in California and I feel like door knocking is more prevalent there. It's not as prevalent here in Austin. Maybe it's more welcomed there. But you know, she will go the door knock if they have a buyer looking in the neighborhood. And then that actually can that can turn into a seller, you know, just by creating that relationship. Yeah, I interviewed somebody in California. This is really interesting who used to work in entertainment. He was works as a production person for movies. And he did it for 15 years and he became a REALTOR. And I said, oh, you must have got all your business from the entertainment industry that you work with. He goes, no, no. None of those people ended up using me as a REALTOR. I just kind of start over and I said, oh, well, how did you do it? He said, I would go to homes that I really thought were super cool. And I would walk to the, you know, to a house. I would knock on the door. I would, I was dressed in a suit. And he said, I, I would know a lot about the house and I would see if the owner was home. And I would say, I am such a fan of this house. I know you're probably not looking to sell or buy, you know, buy, move anytime soon. But when you are, could you please let me know because I want an opportunity to try to either bring you a buyer or maybe even list this property for you like this is a dream house for me. And he would just know things about it. He was like a fan. He would basically go up to these luxury homes and say, I am such a fan of this house. I know things about it. Tell me about it. Tell me the story of this house. And he said it was the smartest thing he ever did. He was from Canada. And he would knock on the door. And I imagine if somebody came to your door and said, oh my God, I love your property. Like you would be so flattered, right? So there are ways to do this that aren't creepy or weird or you know, you're going to get a gun, you know, greeting you at the door. But that's what he does. He would door knock and that's how he built his business. Well, and when you were saying that, I think something that's so important is sellers want someone who's excited about their home. I will say that's actually something that I have struggled with recently because I feel like most markets saw a shift, you know, when interest rates change. And I have to, I don't go into a listing appointment sugar-coating things, you know, I'm not going to take an overpriced listing. And so when I go in there recently, I feel like in my appointments, I've been very matter of the fact when it comes to like where the market is, where the pricing is, and just setting realistic expectations, I don't want to over promise an under-deliver. And sometimes that can lead to kind of a seller feeling like there's a lack of enthusiasm about their property. So I think that's a really good point that you made that I think innately sellers really want to fill like the person who is representing their property is excited about it and passionate about it. So that's a great strategy that he's using. Yeah, I agree. I was really unique and I thought that that was really cool. And you should be into the home that you're listed. You should think it's cool, you know? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, and I bet you sort of work the same way as well. Let's talk a little bit about sort of the future for you. So how do you see yourself continuing to evolve as a REALTOR? Absolutely. So I'm sure there are several of us like better listening. If you've been in the market a while, you might have been I guess a little, I don't know what the right word is. I don't think discourages the right word, but after 2022 things changed. And I in my real estate career every year was always better than the previous year. And then after 2022, myself went down. And I kind of I've always been very goal oriented and had goals for myself, but after that, after around that timeframe, I kind of stopped having goals. I was a little burnt out. And I really was just passively working my business. Still working very hard, but I didn't, I felt like it was like whatever came in, you know, there wasn't there wasn't a goal up there that I was trying to achieve. And that's really where I am trying to shift my focus now is I want to beat my best year and I want to grow. And for me, I'm not props to anybody that wants to sell 300 homes in a year, that's great, but my goal is not for that. My goal is to increase my overall sales volume, but try to maintain, I think I'm comfortable around like 60 deals a year. So for me, obviously what that means is just like increasing the average sales price. But I want to get more, I'm very good about marketing my own listings and really trying to find, always trying to serve the client and know what the new thing is out there for marketing. For example, like when Zillow Showcase listings came out, you know, trying to be in like on Realtor.com, you can boost the listing, trying to know everything that's out there for a seller to market a seller's property. So my marketing has always been focusing on my listings, not focusing on marketing myself, per se. And also, you know, I know, for example, with postcards you have to be consistent and I was not consistent with that. But where I'm going in the future is I have a lot of repeat business and referrals. Last year my repeat business and referrals was like probably 90 to 95%. It's primarily that. And so going into the future and how I see growing my business is really being more strategic on growing my lead source instead of passively working it. I mean, I feel like I get calls almost daily of, oh, hey, Kristi, my rental, I don't want to renew my rental, I want to sell it or this or that. So I get a lot of, I'm very good at having my repeat business and loyalty. But I do want to be more strategic in trying to generate new business. So that's where I see myself. And really I feel like my target goal is, well, I want to reach 100 million, but then I can see myself trying to keep on beating that. But that's kind of like a new target. Amazing. What is hard for you right now? Well, I would say one of my flaws is for the longest time, I feel like I have to do everything myself. And you have to scale your business. You cannot do everything. And that kind of goes back to when agents would be like, what are we farmers? Because I'd be emailing at four o'clock in the morning or I'd be posting like on Facebook my listing at like one a.m. You know, I was just doing everything. And so I got a virtual assistant probably back in 2021 around that time frame. And that was the best thing that ever happened to me. My virtual assistant is amazing. He went back to school. So I have a new virtual assistant who I've had for a while. He's been amazing. But I feel like a lot of agents in not just in real estate across the board and businesses, you know, like my brother, he's an entrepreneur and he has multiple VAs. A lot of people are getting multiple VAs. And then there's companies that are training the VAs specifically for real estate. I have a friend 30 under 30 and he has a business where he now has a VA business and they train them specifically for real estate. But yeah, I would say, you know, that's one of the best things in my business is getting a VA. But then I need to be better about scaling. But I feel like that looks different for me than for other agents. What do you have your VA do? Okay, so my VA he does all my email flyers. I approve everything. But so in constant contact, he goes in and he creates all my email flyers. He creates my email flyers and Frazier flyers, which is a company that sends out flyers to REALTORS. He creates all the reverse prospecting databases to email. So we create the reverse prospecting for the listing and then email them about open houses, price reductions. We generate a database of neighbors for a listing and he adds that to constant contact. So rather than, you know, I know the strategy can be show up to the open house early and door knock the closest 10 homes. We email a wider radius of neighbors and invite them to the open house. So I feel like that's more effective than just knocking on 10 doors. He does all my social media posting. So for example, if I have a new listing, he generates the post. He sends it to me for approval and then he's copy and pasting it across the platforms. I'm the one who's always posting on my stories. So it's still a lot of engagement from me. I would never hire a company that just does like these generated, you know, a post that they do on every single REALTOR. I wanted to be very personal. And then also I know some agents or friends of mine that they will only post certain things on their Instagram and they tell the seller like, oh, I'll post yours on Facebook. I post all my stuff. So it's not like a consistent luxury branding in the sense that I'm posting all my properties at all price points. But then we also delete things like after they've sold just to kind of clean up the Instagram. But he's so he's doing all my social media. I just asked him to put together a listing presentation for me. He's going to do an updated buyer presentation for me. Just really anything that I would have put on the back burner. He is helping me to accomplish that. I love that. And Christy, we should mention that you are in Austin, which of course is a place where people, you know, Texas is one of those states these days where people are traveling to their, their migrating to their retiring to. And, you know, Austin is one of those places in Texas where they land. So we have a lot of listeners out there and they would love to connect with you. And we talked about referrals earlier. So tell us a little bit about, you know, how they should connect with you. If one of our audience members has a buyer or seller that might be a good fit for you. Absolutely. Whatever is easiest for them, they can message me on Instagram. They can text me. They can call me. My number is 512 695 5144. They can email me. Christy at theleadersreality.com. I would be honored to work with your client. And I would want it to come back to you and make you look wonderful. So I would work extra hard for them. But that would be amazing. Also, if anybody wants to reach out to me because they have a question, I am all about collaboration over competition. So if you know me, I am answering calls and questions from REALTORS and just really trying to help each other out. Christy Leonard is our guest today.
