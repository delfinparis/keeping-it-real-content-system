[00:01:15] And now, onto our show.
[00:01:17] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:20] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:24] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:28] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:31] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:33] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:37] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:42] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:48] to leave you?
[00:01:49] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:54] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:58] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:03] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:07] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:12] read everything I offer.
[00:02:13] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:19] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:21] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:23] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:28] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:33] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:36] That's corded.io.
[00:02:38] And now, onto the show.
[00:02:53] Just before we get started today, I wanted to give you special announcement.

[00:04:03] Please be there.
[00:04:04] We have limited seats and we just love doing this with you and it's fun to connect.
[00:04:08] All right, enjoy the episode.
[00:04:23] Hello, there are keepingitreal listeners.
[00:04:26] I am Kim Ripper, a video coach for Real Estate agents.
[00:04:29] I'm excited to teach you all about chat, GPT and AI and how you can use it to make better
[00:04:34] content to sell more goals and make more money.
[00:04:38] I am an award-winning video marketer.
[00:04:41] I help Real Estate agents around the country grow their revenue through incredible video content.
[00:04:46] I have helped top 1% agents in New York City, California and brand new agents around the
[00:04:52] country make more money, really bring more less things in.
[00:04:56] And all of that is through video, the amazing power of video building those connections.
[00:05:01] So because we're talking about chat, GPT, I do want to make sure I'm really bringing
[00:05:06] out chat, GPT is just a tool and we're always selling ourselves, our credibility and our
[00:05:12] connection.
[00:05:13] So the most important thing is to keep working on our communication skills, keep showing
[00:05:17] up on camera, but leveraging chat GPT to make more creative videos, better videos, more
[00:05:22] videos, right?
[00:05:23] So really thinking of it as that tool that's not going to replace you, but it is going
[00:05:27] to make your work maybe faster, maybe easier.
[00:05:31] I use chat GPT a lot and I'll go into that.
[00:05:33] I got here physically here, not physically here in New York City, but I got here I was
[00:05:39] in media for about 20 years and now I am to speak around the country.
[00:05:42] I was a keynote at next home in MnConnect, Berkshire Halfway Home Services and I basically
[00:05:48] worked for all the agencies, for agents, all the agencies across the country.
[00:05:53] And for me it's really fun to help you grow your revenue.
[00:05:56] I mean I'm a fellow business owner and I know the challenge of showing up and marketing
[00:05:59] yourself in addition to running your business.
[00:06:01] So A, it's about making good content that connects, but also balancing it with the workload.
[00:06:07] So I'm going to really give a couple of solid pointers today on chat GPT.
[00:06:11] If you want to learn more, make sure to go to Kimrickberg.com slash RE tips like real
[00:06:16] estate, RE tips and you'll grab my five videos that every agent must know.
[00:06:23] It's a really amazing tip sheet and you can find me on Instagram or LinkedIn and YouTube.
[00:06:28] Just search K-I-M-R-I-T-T-B-E-R-G Kimrickberg and I have lots of amazing free resources.
[00:06:35] And before I jump into the teaching, once a year I run a four day video boot camp
[00:06:39] intensive, everything you need to know to show confident on camera, to make great videos
[00:06:45] and actually bring in clients.
[00:06:46] My real estate agents who come through video boot camp have made seven or eight,
[00:06:51] so actually now it's up to eight, eight million dollars just from video, eight million
[00:06:55] dollars in new sales just from video directly that they can trace just two of them together
[00:06:59] made that.
[00:07:00] Again, I want that to be you.
[00:07:02] So in just four days, you will learn everything you need to know about video that is in early
[00:07:06] May, so do not do not wait.
[00:07:09] Send me a message.
[00:07:10] And if there's still spots, I would love to connect and see if it's a fit for you.
[00:07:13] So that's the video boot camp intensive in early May.
[00:07:16] Drop me a line about that.
[00:07:17] You drop me a line on social.
[00:07:19] It'll be linked down the show notes.
[00:07:20] And now we will jump into chat GPT.
[00:07:23] So I spoke about this at the Fast Company Innovation Festival in the fall about how to leverage
[00:07:29] chat GPT for better content.
[00:07:31] So a couple of the things that are really important, obviously, for agents, what are you
[00:07:36] going to talk about?
[00:07:37] So chat GPT can be helpful when you're looking to brainstorm, whether you're out of ideas
[00:07:42] or whether you just need a help or helper using it for a brainstorm.
[00:07:46] I'll give you a specific example.
[00:07:48] So recently, I was working with my client, Michelle, and she's in the Midwest, and we were
[00:07:53] talking about she had a home that she was trying to present in a way that's flattering,
[00:07:58] but it was kind of an older home.
[00:08:00] So we took what she had.
[00:08:02] I put it into chat GPT and said, give me some video hooks or give me some caption hooks
[00:08:07] on how to describe this home in a way that's flattering, but also acknowledges that it's
[00:08:11] not an older home.
[00:08:13] And it really came up with some gems.
[00:08:15] I think some of the words were like charming, timeless, things like that that were, they
[00:08:21] just phrased it in a really effective way.
[00:08:23] And Michelle's like, great, I'm going to take that.
[00:08:25] So what you can do is you can put in and say, I'm going to give you my example.
[00:08:30] I am a real estate agent in New York City.
[00:08:34] My main audience are first time home buyers.
[00:08:38] Please give me the top 10 questions they're asking, right?
[00:08:42] So you can use it to help you come up with ideas.
[00:08:46] You can also say to chat GPT when they get those questions.
[00:08:49] Write me the answers.
[00:08:51] I'm going to warn you about getting the answers straight from chat GPT.
[00:08:55] If you can get them from chat GPT, so good everybody else.
[00:08:59] So it's very important to remember it is giving you just basically like a research.
[00:09:03] So I think, not I think, professionally I know, it's really important to bring in your
[00:09:08] expertise.
[00:09:09] So what that might sound like is if I take one of the questions, how much of my income
[00:09:16] should go to rent?
[00:09:17] So let's say I'm answering, how much of my income should go to rent?
[00:09:20] I would say in New York City, one of the most expensive cities in the country, the percent
[00:09:26] of income to rent is higher than other places or we understand it's higher or whatever,
[00:09:30] right?
[00:09:31] But I might want to give an example of a client experience in that.
[00:09:35] That way someone seeing, oh, Kim's giving advice and is coming from her perspective,
[00:09:40] from her experience.
[00:09:41] She's not just Googling this.
[00:09:43] So again, you really want to bring in your knowledge of your area, your experience,
[00:09:47] your client experiences.
[00:09:48] So I do like to warn about just like taking the chat GPT answers.
[00:09:53] It sounds like a robot.
[00:09:55] So even if sometimes actually it might sound pretty good, just make sure it sounds like
[00:10:01] you and that you agree with it.
[00:10:03] Another way you can do it is write the scripts.
[00:10:06] So for example, I have an agent in New York City.
[00:10:09] We want to do a history of Union Square or Astro Place, which is right near Union Square.
[00:10:14] And we put in, please write me a 60 second script of the history of Union Square or Astro
[00:10:19] Place.
[00:10:20] And please give me sources.
[00:10:23] So I was a journalist for a long time in TV.
[00:10:25] I worked at Netflix, I would, inside edition, Fox.
[00:10:27] I think it is important to get those sources.
[00:10:29] You want to make sure what they're telling you is not, is legitimate.
[00:10:33] So that's another thing.
[00:10:35] And then here's a little cheat sheet of what you can do when you get the content from
[00:10:41] chat GPT.
[00:10:42] So number one, know yourself.
[00:10:44] So you want to give chat GPT information about you.
[00:10:47] Where you're based, who your demographic is, maybe what's your average home buyer, home
[00:10:53] listing price.
[00:10:55] You really want to have it understand the more you can give it about yourself, but also
[00:10:59] of your client avatar.
[00:11:01] That gives you more specific information.
[00:11:03] You don't want it to give you advice for the wrong people or the wrong types of homes
[00:11:07] or the wrong types of neighborhood.
[00:11:09] All right.
[00:11:09] And then when you get it, apply the SAG, SAG.
[00:11:13] If you have good content from chat GPT, it will soar.
[00:11:16] And if you don't, it will sag like a lead balloon.
[00:11:18] So S does it sound like me?
[00:11:20] A, do I agree with it?
[00:11:21] G is a generic.
[00:11:24] S does it sound like me?
[00:11:25] I mentioned this before, you need to make sure it really does get your voice.
[00:11:29] And it is how you talk, but it also has things that you would say.
[00:11:34] Incorporate your own personal experiences from your business.
[00:11:37] Do you agree with it?
[00:11:38] Oh my God.
[00:11:39] Sometimes chat GPT will give you something and you're like, I really don't think that.
[00:11:42] Don't use it.
[00:11:44] G is a generic.
[00:11:45] You do not want it to be generic.
[00:11:47] Generic is bad.
[00:11:48] Generic is garbage.
[00:11:50] Generic is information that anyone can find anywhere online.
[00:11:53] And you want to be able to have content that not anyone can find.
[00:11:57] You want things that only you can bring to people.
[00:12:00] So maybe you got the idea from chat GPT, but it's from you in a different direction.
[00:12:05] And you took that brainstorm and you ran with it.
[00:12:07] So use chat GPT in its entirety or just as a jumping off point.
[00:12:11] Right.
[00:12:12] So I'm trying to think another example that we've used recently with a client.
[00:12:16] So we have the history of aster place.
[00:12:18] We did the make this listing sound better.
[00:12:21] And then we have the let's answer these questions.
[00:12:24] So really you can use chat GPT to actually give you that.
[00:12:30] What should I make?
[00:12:31] What should I talk about on camera?
[00:12:33] Ask GPT to help you with that.
[00:12:35] I'm going to be honest.
[00:12:36] I love marketing.
[00:12:37] I love video.
[00:12:37] I've been a video in TV for nearly 20 years.
[00:12:39] You can hear it in my voice.
[00:12:40] But the truth is, even I am like out of juice sometimes.
[00:12:44] I'm just tired.
[00:12:45] I brought my kids off.
[00:12:47] I don't have any brain power left.
[00:12:48] I'll go into chat GPT.
[00:12:49] Hey chat GPT, take this article I wrote and give me some ideas for a short video I can
[00:12:57] make from it.
[00:12:58] Or one time I said, OK, give me this.
[00:13:01] I already did this speech.
[00:13:02] Give me, take this transcript of the speech.
[00:13:06] Turn it into a proposal to speak somewhere else.
[00:13:08] So you can really just use it to reconstitute your content.
[00:13:12] You can take social media posts you had before and say turn this Facebook post into a 60 second
[00:13:19] video.
[00:13:21] OK, I'm having a hard time talking.
[00:13:22] Today I'm practicing for half marathon.
[00:13:25] Drop me a note on social media if you have run any half marathon.
[00:13:28] I am very tired.
[00:13:30] It is very hard.
[00:13:31] The last time I wrote, ran a half marathon was two children ago and 11 years ago.
[00:13:36] So anyway, that's what's going on in my life.
[00:13:38] I hope you're doing great and having an awesome spring.
[00:13:40] Drop me a note on Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, wherever, Kim, Ritberg.
[00:13:46] And again, we have limited spots for that video bootcamp intensive in early May.
[00:13:50] So drop me a note and we can opt on the phone and see if it's a fit for you.
[00:13:53] It's an all-in-one live coaching program that will take you from on the hamster wheel
[00:13:57] content to actually making great content that you feel confident about that you could put
[00:14:02] out there and bring in clients.
[00:14:03] So until next time, make sure to keep showing up on video and tag me when you do.
[00:14:08] Don't forget to tag me.

I put it into chat GPT and said, give me some video hooks or give me some caption hooks on how to describe this home in a way that's flattering, but also acknowledges that it's not an older home. And it really came up with some gems. I think some of the words were like charming, timeless, things like that that were, they just phrased it in a really effective way. And Michelle's like, great, I'm going to take that. So what you can do is you can put in and say, I'm going to give you my example. I am a real estate agent in New York City. My main audience are first time home buyers. Please give me the top 10 questions they're asking, right? So you can use it to help you come up with ideas. You can also say to chat GPT when they get those questions. Write me the answers. I'm going to warn you about getting the answers straight from chat GPT. If you can get them from chat GPT, so good everybody else. So it's very important to remember it is giving you just basically like a research. So I think, not I think, professionally I know, it's really important to bring in your expertise. So what that might sound like is if I take one of the questions, how much of my income should go to rent? So let's say I'm answering, how much of my income should go to rent? I would say in New York City, one of the most expensive cities in the country, the percent of income to rent is higher than other places or we understand it's higher or whatever, right? But I might want to give an example of a client experience in that. That way someone seeing, oh, Kim's giving advice and is coming from her perspective, from her experience. She's not just Googling this. So again, you really want to bring in your knowledge of your area, your experience, your client experiences. So I do like to warn about just like taking the chat GPT answers. It sounds like a robot. So even if sometimes actually it might sound pretty good, just make sure it sounds like you and that you agree with it. Another way you can do it is write the scripts. So for example, I have an agent in New York City. We want to do a history of Union Square or Astro Place, which is right near Union Square. And we put in, please write me a 60 second script of the history of Union Square or Astro Place. And please give me sources. So I was a journalist for a long time in TV. I worked at Netflix, I would, inside edition, Fox. I think it is important to get those sources. You want to make sure what they're telling you is not, is legitimate. So that's another thing. And then here's a little cheat sheet of what you can do when you get the content from chat GPT. So number one, know yourself. So you want to give chat GPT information about you. Where you're based, who your demographic is, maybe what's your average home buyer, home listing price. You really want to have it understand the more you can give it about yourself, but also of your client avatar. That gives you more specific information. You don't want it to give you advice for the wrong people or the wrong types of homes or the wrong types of neighborhood. All right. And then when you get it, apply the SAG, SAG. If you have good content from chat GPT, it will soar. And if you don't, it will sag like a lead balloon. So S does it sound like me? A, do I agree with it? G is a generic. S does it sound like me? I mentioned this before, you need to make sure it really does get your voice. And it is how you talk, but it also has things that you would say. Incorporate your own personal experiences from your business. Do you agree with it? Oh my God. Sometimes chat GPT will give you something and you're like, I really don't think that. Don't use it. G is a generic. You do not want it to be generic. Generic is bad. Generic is garbage. Generic is information that anyone can find anywhere online. And you want to be able to have content that not anyone can find. You want things that only you can bring to people. So maybe you got the idea from chat GPT, but it's from you in a different direction. And you took that brainstorm and you ran with it. So use chat GPT in its entirety or just as a jumping off point. Right. So I'm trying to think another example that we've used recently with a client. So we have the history of aster place. We did the make this listing sound better. And then we have the let's answer these questions. So really you can use chat GPT to actually give you that. What should I make? What should I talk about on camera? Ask GPT to help you with that. I'm going to be honest. I love marketing. I love video. I've been a video in TV for nearly 20 years. You can hear it in my voice. But the truth is, even I am like out of juice sometimes. I'm just tired. I brought my kids off. I don't have any brain power left. I'll go into chat GPT. Hey chat GPT, take this article I wrote and give me some ideas for a short video I can make from it. Or one time I said, OK, give me this. I already did this speech. Give me, take this transcript of the speech. Turn it into a proposal to speak somewhere else. So you can really just use it to reconstitute your content. You can take social media posts you had before and say turn this Facebook post into a 60 second video. OK, I'm having a hard time talking. Today I'm practicing for half marathon. Drop me a note on social media if you have run any half marathon. I am very tired. It is very hard. The last time I wrote, ran a half marathon was two children ago and 11 years ago. So anyway, that's what's going on in my life. I hope you're doing great and having an awesome spring. Drop me a note on Instagram, LinkedIn, Facebook, YouTube, wherever, Kim, Ritberg. And again, we have limited spots for that video bootcamp intensive in early May. So drop me a note and we can opt on the phone and see if it's a fit for you. It's an all-in-one live coaching program that will take you from on the hamster wheel content to actually making great content that you feel confident about that you could put out there and bring in clients. So until next time, make sure to keep showing up on video and tag me when you do. Don't forget to tag me.
