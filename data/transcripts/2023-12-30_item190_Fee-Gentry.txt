[00:03:03] Let me tell you more about fee.

[00:03:55] which is at fee gentry.
[00:03:57] Feed, welcome to the show.
[00:03:59] Well, thank you, DJ.
[00:04:00] Man, I was like, when you were reading that, I was like, who's he talking about?
[00:04:04] Who's that amazing person?
[00:04:05] Who's that lady?
[00:04:06] He sounds like she sounds like she sounds like she sounds like she's a little superstar.
[00:04:10] Well, you are a superstar and I am excited to, number one,
[00:04:14] you're such a sweet person.
[00:04:16] We were just chatting backstage and I'm really, really excited to speak with you.
[00:04:20] But besides being just a pleasant and lovely person, I really want to,
[00:04:24] you have some really great things we're going to talk about today,
[00:04:26] specifically money that REALTORS are leaving on the table.
[00:04:30] And also with the talk of AI and just technology always,
[00:04:34] you know, increasing and trying to edge out REALTORS,
[00:04:37] what we can do to future proof our businesses.
[00:04:40] So we're going to talk a lot about that.
[00:04:41] But before we get to that, to that, let's talk about you.
[00:04:45] And I'd love to hear about how you got into real estate because you have done a lot.
[00:04:49] So tell us about that journey.
[00:04:51] Man, real estate DJ was like plan F for me.
[00:04:55] Like I had, it was nowhere on my radar.
[00:04:58] I mean, actually I was in physical therapy school.
[00:05:01] So I had, you know, my goal was to be a physical therapist.
[00:05:03] And I, you know, so I went to PT school, you know, I did post rehabilitation.
[00:05:06] I mean, that was, you know, fitness.
[00:05:08] That was my career.
[00:05:10] And we should mention for anyone, I'm sorry to interrupt your lovely story.
[00:05:14] But just to make a big deal about this, PT school is often talked about as being just
[00:05:19] as challenging to get into as pre-med because there's,
[00:05:23] there's fewer actually PT schools than there are mescoles.
[00:05:25] And I don't know if that's still the case, but it is a big deal to get into a PT program.
[00:05:30] And so, yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:05:31] So tell us tell us.
[00:05:32] Yeah.
[00:05:32] So I was, yeah, so I was in the number one physical therapy program
[00:05:36] in the state of Texas.
[00:05:37] And I just, boom, I just said, this is not for me.
[00:05:39] Like because I had, you know, it was just weird.
[00:05:41] And I was on, and I've always been an entrepreneur since the age of like 9, 10, 11 years old,
[00:05:45] I've always had businesses.
[00:05:47] So I, you know, read this little book like a lot of people have, right?
[00:05:50] That book called Rich Dad Poor Dad by Kia Sox.
[00:05:53] Sure.
[00:05:53] And you know, that one little sentence says that 90% of people,
[00:05:57] of million, you know, of millionaires or people who have wealth
[00:05:59] are in the real estate business.
[00:06:01] I didn't see the sales part.
[00:06:02] I just saw in the real estate business.
[00:06:06] So silly me, my mom was building a house in central Texas site unseen.
[00:06:10] And so her REALTOR was like, and who also happened to be the commissioner of the state of Texas
[00:06:15] was like, we, I came to meet, you know, check on, check on the house and meet with him.
[00:06:19] And he said, you would be really good in real estate.
[00:06:22] He was on to introduce you to one of my friends who happened to be the, and she was there.
[00:06:26] I didn't know who it was.
[00:06:27] Avis Wukash, having to be the commissioner of the state of Texas.
[00:06:30] And they're like, you could be top 1% and I was like, eh, you know,
[00:06:33] I just didn't even listen to them and I blew it off.
[00:06:36] And I thought about it for a while and I start having all these people recruit me
[00:06:40] into the real estate industry and I promised you DJ.
[00:06:42] I did not know a, you know, a listing from a lock box.
[00:06:45] I got the business. I had no clue.
[00:06:47] And so first year I sold 39 homes unbeknownst to me.
[00:06:51] I thought it sucked. I didn't, I was like, because I got this,
[00:06:55] I got this little bronze medal.
[00:06:56] I was at the big red company, you know, KW.
[00:06:59] And I got this bronze medal.
[00:07:00] I was like, eh, how do I get a silver?
[00:07:02] I mean, how do I get a gold bronze?
[00:07:04] That's the worst of all the medals.
[00:07:05] Great. It really made it on the podium.
[00:07:07] And if you don't know this about me, but I'm 5'11", almost 6' tall.
[00:07:11] So my, you know, former collegiate athlete loves sports.
[00:07:13] So I'm like, very competitive.
[00:07:15] So that's how I got in the business of real estate.
[00:07:18] And so I just grew from there.
[00:07:19] So I went from being a solo agent that I grew that I became like a,
[00:07:24] I was in a smaller town.
[00:07:25] I was living up north.
[00:07:26] And so I was kind of like this medium-sized fish in a small pond
[00:07:30] and start growing a team of people and then wanted to start.
[00:07:33] I wanted to, you know, own a franchise and that didn't work out.
[00:07:37] Thank God, because 2008 then happened.
[00:07:39] Good time.
[00:07:41] Save myself.
[00:07:42] But I still, I mean, I still took a blood bath like everybody else.
[00:07:45] But, but yeah, so that's how I ended the business.
[00:07:48] Yeah.
[00:07:49] Wow. That is, that's quite a story.
[00:07:51] And your story doesn't end there because from there you went on to serve
[00:07:55] and management capacities at the corporate level,
[00:07:58] you know, with eXp in particular and just, you know, continually coaching,
[00:08:04] consulting, writing, you do it all and it is, it's so impressive.
[00:08:11] And there's so much we could talk about.
[00:08:13] And I think, you know, being that you were so connected to agents,
[00:08:18] I would love to talk about, you know, 2024.
[00:08:21] This episode might not actually publish until early January or potentially late
[00:08:26] December, but regardless, it'll be, you know, 2024 is on everybody's mind.
[00:08:31] No matter when this actually drops.
[00:08:34] But people had a tough 2023 or at least the most of the agents I knew.
[00:08:38] I have just so often I talk to an agent that I'm having my best year ever.
[00:08:41] I was maybe 1% of the agents I talked to.
[00:08:43] So, so for most of us, it was a, it was a tricky and difficult year.
[00:08:48] And I think, you know, for somebody like yourself who's so disciplined,
[00:08:52] so focused, so just committed to finding solutions.
[00:08:55] I really do want to talk about what agents can do in 2024.
[00:09:00] Just to help keep their, keep stay in business and keep their business rolling forward.
[00:09:05] So just any advice or guidance that you might have for what agents should be
[00:09:09] focusing on right now during the winter months when we know things are slower anyway.
[00:09:13] But how they could set themselves up for possibly having a better 2024 or 2025.
[00:09:19] Right. That is an amazing question.
[00:09:22] And I get that question a lot and I talk about that a lot.
[00:09:24] We wish we'd have started in October.
[00:09:27] So the people that I work with, we say, let's start in October that 90 day window.
[00:09:30] Right. But since since we can't do anything about it, let's start today.
[00:09:33] So what can you do today?
[00:09:35] And I always talk about what do you need to do right now to future proof your business.
[00:09:39] Right for 2024.
[00:09:40] So that and I, and so my goal here for your audience is just to help set them free.
[00:09:44] Right. Free from, you know, worry about artificial intelligence taking over.
[00:09:49] Free from, you know, the tax from these major, you know, institutional investors.
[00:09:54] And I want to set them free from any other outside forces because the first part that that we ought to talk about is
[00:10:01] let's set their, let's get their mind in check.
[00:10:03] Right. So I want them to, I don't want to be a victim of the economy.
[00:10:06] I want them to, you know, first of all, let's talk about your mindset.
[00:10:09] You have to make a decision.
[00:10:09] So that's the very first thing I talked to people about.
[00:10:11] Make a decision that you should thrive in 2024.
[00:10:14] Number two is to have a plan.
[00:10:17] Like, and not a plan and people keep writing business plans, but I'm talking about an action plan.
[00:10:22] Because we, we all feel good about planning.
[00:10:24] Oh, well, I wrote my business plan for 2024.
[00:10:27] Well, what are you going to do?
[00:10:28] What are the action steps that you're going to take in the first 30 days?
[00:10:31] And I always talk about this is keep it simple.
[00:10:35] We write these elaborate business plans and I'm just talking to people about in 2024.
[00:10:39] We're going to just have to keep it simple.
[00:10:41] Like and go back to the basics and the fundamentals of of everything.
[00:10:46] Yes, we need to leverage artificial intelligence and learn how to use that.
[00:10:49] But we need to leverage it.
[00:10:51] And why I'm calling collective capitalism is or collective, you know, or collaborative capitalism this year.
[00:10:57] That's what people should be focusing on in 2024.
[00:11:00] Who it's not what you need to do or how to do it.
[00:11:03] Who do you need to connect with in order to get through the next year to two years and possibly even three years?
[00:11:11] Because I believe this is the, you know, according to fee disclaimer, right?
[00:11:15] These are just my own thoughts.
[00:11:16] I believe that real estate is going to substantially change.
[00:11:19] In the next 24 to 48 months, whether it's from the Department of Justice, you know, the court cases or whether it's, you know, technology or the consumers who've just decided,
[00:11:32] we've just they want they've got a different feed and they want to and they want to do something or the collapse of NAR.
[00:11:37] I mean, I don't know.
[00:11:38] No, I know Crystal Ball.
[00:11:40] But either way, like I said, my goal is to set your audience free to do something different this year.
[00:11:46] Thank you.
[00:11:47] And I think by the way, a wonderful goal and very appreciative to you to come on here and and share some of your wisdom and knowledge.
[00:11:56] And we should, you know, I was thinking as you were saying about keeping it simple.
[00:12:01] So I recruit agents for a living and our audience, a lot of them don't do that.
[00:12:05] But I think you can pass our audience can possibly relate to this little quick story.
[00:12:09] So for years and years every week, we'd have a management meeting and it would they would say DJ, how many people did you hire this week?
[00:12:14] And that was our measure of how well DJ I was doing.
[00:12:18] And I've been doing this 13 years.
[00:12:19] So that's just a standard metric.
[00:12:21] It's like how many sales did you get?
[00:12:22] You know, that kind of thing.
[00:12:23] But it was how many people did I recruit?
[00:12:25] And then we finally realized that what we call our key performance indicators, that's just the end result of me doing all the other tasks.
[00:12:33] And so, you know, assuming that I never get better at recruiting, what is the actual driver?
[00:12:38] It's how many conversations do I have on a daily basis?
[00:12:40] So it reminds me of that Brian Bafini, old Brian Bafini thing that where he would say you got to meet two to five people every day if you're a REALTOR and just add them to your database.
[00:12:51] And I was like, well, and there's a lot more to it, of course.
[00:12:54] But if we're looking at the most basic activity that a REALTOR should probably consider if they don't have enough business right now is keep adding people to your database, keep having conversations, meet new people, get them into your CRM.
[00:13:08] And so for me, I don't focus on how many people I recruited anymore.
[00:13:11] It's how many conversations that I have this week with agents.
[00:13:14] And then, you know, we track my close ratio and all of that.
[00:13:17] But really what we're following on is we know DJ needs to talk to 20 different agents a week if he's going to get, you know, five people to join or whatever.
[00:13:23] So, so I really appreciate you saying that because we can look at the end result sales, you know, deals closed and go, and then we can go, that's a lot of stress.
[00:13:33] If we go back to just, I got to beat a whole bunch of people and I go, and that's not the only thing anyone needs to do.
[00:13:39] But it's, it's a way to think about scaling back your, you know, what do I actually need to do on a daily basis?
[00:13:46] Absolutely. That's the one if you do nothing else. That's it.
[00:13:50] If you never improve your skill set, I mean, this is what I always say too.
[00:13:53] Like with me, if I never become any better as a recruiter, if I just double the number of people I talk to, in theory, I should double the number of recruits that I have.
[00:14:02] And of course, we're going to get everything.
[00:14:05] But, but yeah, so, so let's, let's talk a little bit more.
[00:14:09] So, so thinking about, yes, there's all of these outside factors, you know, you mentioned technology.
[00:14:14] We talk about the rise of AI, the flight to teams, there's lawsuits, there's all these things that, and I want to go back to mindset just for a moment because I was curious of what your advice is for you.
[00:14:29] You talked about first making a decision that I'm going to have a good next 12 months.
[00:14:33] Yes.
[00:14:34] How do you protect that mindset?
[00:14:36] Because we know that it's, you know, when things are good, it's easy to have the mindset.
[00:14:41] When things are strong, are challenging, it's harder.
[00:14:44] So, do you have any any, any suggestions to protect that mindset and really guard it so that some of these outside influences don't start to color it in a way that we now are, oh my gosh, oh, this isn't going to happen.
[00:14:55] Yeah, I am 100% my own best credit, my own best person at that.
[00:15:02] Number one, I always do is like turn off the television, get off social media, and then get away from negative people.
[00:15:09] And what are all those three things have people?
[00:15:11] 
[00:15:11] And it's kind of weird.
[00:15:12] Like we're supposed to talk to people.
[00:15:14] So, like, yes, like want you to have conversations, but with the right type of people, right?
[00:15:19] But it's so, but in the other thing that I do is I have, you know, I have a lot of my friends or colleagues were all learners.
[00:15:26] So, we're, you know, we're staying atop of books.
[00:15:29] So, we're reading books on mindset, on, you know, manifestation or money or prayer, whatever it is that you believe in.
[00:15:36] Find something that you can do every single day that takes you out of this crazy world and brings you back inward.
[00:15:43] Because we keep looking at these external forces.
[00:15:46] Everything we need is already inside of us.
[00:15:48] And so, that's the number one thing that I really recommend is for people to go inward when everybody else is being crazy.
[00:15:56] Yeah, and also we can get crazy too.
[00:15:59] And so, this idea of, of having a practice, some sort of discipline, like you were saying prayer, meditation, whatever it is,
[00:16:07] something that takes you a little bit outside of the craziness that we all deal with inside our own heads too.
[00:16:14] This is, it gives some additional space in our lives to be able to say, you know what?
[00:16:21] There's more than just me out here.
[00:16:23] I'm somehow connecting with this, you know, greater thing that's not just me.
[00:16:29] And it's a nice respite from sometimes our own struggles that we have.
[00:16:35] So, I'm a big, big fan of that and big believer in that as well.
[00:16:40] And also, I think it's the birthplace of creativity.
[00:16:42] I think when you can get quiet and listen to your intuition, like you were saying that sometimes,
[00:16:49] and a lot of times the answer is bubble, bubble up.
[00:16:51] But if you're not quiet, I don't, if I'm not quiet, I don't hear them.
[00:16:55] Me neither. Yeah, yeah. I just, I absolutely just, like, I'm, I do that twice a day.
[00:17:00] I just get quiet twice a day or with something, you know, and I always recommend,
[00:17:04] finding that piece for me.
[00:17:06] It's like either putting my feet in the grass, looking at water, something like that,
[00:17:10] like connecting with nature, connecting with your inner, you know, your, your source,
[00:17:13] whatever you need to do music, but just find, like, find that internal piece is, is really, really key.
[00:17:20] Yeah.
[00:17:20] Yeah. And the other thing too that I think about, I'm curious to get your, your take on it is this,
[00:17:25] it's an old expression, but I think it's accurate, at least for me, that the journey is really,
[00:17:30] is really where it's at. The destination is nice and it's nice to celebrate.
[00:17:34] And you know, when we, when we have these major goals, we accomplish, it's great for a day or two to sort of celebrate.
[00:17:40] And then I don't know, but I often, well, I'll, for me, I often get depressed when I, when I achieve a goal.
[00:17:46] And I, which I didn't know was very common.
[00:17:49] I can get really, really depressed because then I'm like, oh, now, okay, now what?
[00:17:55] You know, and then it's like, I got to just, and if I, if I were to think about, yes, the goal is nice.
[00:18:00] And we should celebrate our, our wins.
[00:18:02] And then we should realize it's all about chopping wood and carrying water just consistently doing, doing the work.
[00:18:08] Yeah.
[00:18:09] Yeah, that's, that's it.
[00:18:11] DJ, I'm glad you mentioned that because I call it's the mom of mentality.
[00:18:14] There's a lot of us, especially in the real estate industry, or like, like I said, you know, as it be in an athlete or something.
[00:18:19] So I think about Kobe Bryant, it's that, you know, after the championships, he goes back and he's looking at game film and shooting a thousand shots.
[00:18:25] After he's won a championship, I'm that girl, you know, I'm that girl too.
[00:18:29] And so the journey, as I've gotten older and I'm, and I've started learning and appreciate patients and enjoying just the little things like the, just the habit of practice.
[00:18:39] We're just about practice, right?
[00:18:40] Just practice and enjoying that journey.
[00:18:42] But man,
[00:18:45] it took me three years plus.
[00:18:47] I mean, just taking me a long time.
[00:18:48] I was talking to my personal trainer the other week or two ago.
[00:18:54] And I was saying, I'm just going to have to throw myself in the way of pain, physical pain for the rest of my life.
[00:18:59] If I want to be fit, there's nothing pleasant to me about like lifting heavy weights.
[00:19:04] It's painful. It hurts. It's, but he, the results are pretty cool.
[00:19:09] But I have to be willing to go through the discomfort and the willing, I mean, tell muscles grow.
[00:19:14] It's how we grow as people.
[00:19:16] So this idea of like throwing ourselves into discomfort is, is not fun.
[00:19:20] But it seems to be the only way I know to do it.
[00:19:23] So this idea of getting into habits, you know, and just like, I don't like working out, but I do it.
[00:19:30] I don't, I don't have to like it. I just do it.
[00:19:32] Yeah, it's about, yeah, it's about creating habits.
[00:19:35] That's why I was talking about, you know, when you're making people making plans and goals, no, you need to just develop habits.
[00:19:41] That's the number one thing James clears book is probably one of the books that I recommend more than anything is atomic habits, long read.
[00:19:47] And in the way he builds that book, it's creating habit, right?
[00:19:50] I mean, when the way that we even lays out the book, so yeah, it's creating habits of man.
[00:19:54] Like you said, it sucks, but you just, you just do it.
[00:19:58] Yeah, and here's, here's the good news.
[00:20:00] I was thinking about this with exercise.
[00:20:01] So I don't like exercise. Some people do. I truly, I know some people actually really do love it.
[00:20:06] So I'm only speaking for myself, but I never did enjoy lifting heavy weights and, you know, even doing cardio is not my favorite thing.
[00:20:15] But if I want to, if I want to live a long life, I probably have to do those things.
[00:20:19] So I finally just said, well, I got to do it. I don't have to like it. I just have to do it.
[00:20:22] And so if you have parts of your business that you don't like to do, but are critical, then you can start to think about, do I have to force myself?
[00:20:31] Sometimes the answer may be yes, or it may be I can leverage other someone else to maybe do something for me because number one, I don't like doing it or number two.
[00:20:40] I'm not good at it. And there's all these ways now to get people to help you.
[00:20:45] We have a global economy. We have this gig economy that we can tap into and get help from people in other places that, you know, maybe charge less than what people locally would charge to do similar work.
[00:20:57] And if you're having problems staying on top of your habits, yeah, well, maybe get some help or get an accountability partner.
[00:21:04] But I want to talk a little bit about future proofing one's business and this idea of having leaving money on the, sorry, leaving money on the table because I think this is something that most agents don't think about at all.
[00:21:18] They're just focused on the next transaction, the next client, and there are a lot of opportunities.
[00:21:23] I, as somebody who is in management at a brokerage, you know, this is a huge focus for brokerage owners right now, but it also can be something that teams, agents,
[00:21:33] they really should be thinking about additional streams of income. So let's talk about that.
[00:21:38] Yeah, so this is probably one of my favorite things to talk about. And I've been talking about it for a long period of time. So DJ, most real estate professionals are renting their careers.
[00:21:48] Let me say that again, most real estate professionals are renting their careers. They're going from transaction to transaction.
[00:21:54] They're doing, you know, they're, they're, they might be at a brokerage where is they have unfavorable terms.
[00:22:01] And then the other parts of the money that they're leaving on the table. So I want you to imagine this and I always kind of do this exercise.
[00:22:09] Draw circles. So if somebody's watching this, do this as I'm talking about it. Write a circle, put your name in the middle of it.
[00:22:15] What do wrote most real estate agents do? Like how many people, how many people get paid during a real estate transaction?
[00:22:21] So let's, let's just start naming them. Who gets paid during a real estate transaction?
[00:22:24] The REALTOR. The REALTORS, both so buyer seller side, the buyer sellers, the brokerage gets paid.
[00:22:31] The title, title company gets paid. The lender gets paid.
[00:22:35] Right. Video inspector.
[00:22:37] Yep. Home inspector.
[00:22:39] The utility companies get paid if it's sometimes movers, movers, movers. Yeah.
[00:22:45] You to videographer, stagers, the state, the state, the state, you know, the state records county clerk's.
[00:22:55] So DJ, when I do this, I have found that on one single transaction, up to 41 people get paid off of one transaction.
[00:23:02] And guess who's in the middle of that transaction?
[00:23:04] Yeah, the agent, the agent. And that's what I talk about leaving money on the table.
[00:23:09] We are now when you talked about that gig economy. We have the ability now as entrepreneurs.
[00:23:13] We have to stop being self employed. I'm talking to people about be going from solo to CEO or being self employed to real estate business owner.
[00:23:21] And a lot of people think they're real estate business owners and they're not. They are self employed.
[00:23:26] And so the entrepreneur of the future is going to have to stop leaving money on the table.
[00:23:32] And there are, you know, compliant ways for you to get paid, especially from title, from from from mortgage company, you know, from mortgages, because you're watching the brokers do it.
[00:23:41] I mean, our brokerages are doing that in the models of, you know, so now in the future.
[00:23:45] And it's nothing new, but it's a different way to look at it. Look at it.
[00:23:49] If you keep saying that you're lindering my lending partner, if you're lending partners, not providing you
[00:23:54] resources or an ability to get paid or something, that's not your partner.
[00:24:00] That's just a vendor. And so we just.
[00:24:02] Just a vendor. Yep.
[00:24:03] It's just a vendor. And so there are so many different ways to get paid on the table.
[00:24:07] If you're, we have, you know, we have real estate professionals who have you can own a vending company.
[00:24:13] We have real estate. I mean, you know, I'm sorry, but a staging company.
[00:24:17] We have we have real estate owners who own who can become, you know, property managers, you know, what, you know, yeah, check your local.
[00:24:25] But there's so many. Sure. Sure.
[00:24:26] I'm looking right now in this country.
[00:24:28] We have 30,000 baby boomers retiring every day in junior wants to be a YouTube star.
[00:24:35] He doesn't want to own a plumbing company, a H back company.
[00:24:39] He doesn't care about being a property manager, but we have the ability to go ahead and buy our cashflow.
[00:24:44] We as real estate professionals can buy our cashflow.
[00:24:47] We keep creating these companies and doing these transactions, but we can create, we can buy cleaning companies.
[00:24:52] We can buy move out companies.
[00:24:54] I mean, there's so many different ways right now for us to make money.
[00:24:58] And we're leaving $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 a month on the table.
[00:25:02] So that's what I've been doing lately is either buying into equity, so creating equity positions with companies who
[00:25:09] who already service the real estate industry, where they're handyman companies.
[00:25:12] I've got a landscaping company, tile and grout company, all those get paid off of a real estate transaction, by the way.
[00:25:18] And that's where that's where there's the opportunity.
[00:25:22] And so especially those in the real estate businesses like who are, you know, bigger teams, you're already utilizing these services.
[00:25:28] You know, the moving services, moving trucks.
[00:25:30] I mean, moving companies, there's so many opportunities like we talked about the 41 ways that people up to 41 ways,
[00:25:36] people get paid off of one single real estate transaction.
[00:25:39] That's how you're leaving money off on the table.
[00:25:42] I love that.
[00:25:43] And this idea of investing and taking some of your capital, your commission money, for example,
[00:25:49] and reinvesting it into another business where you have an equity position.
[00:25:53] And yes, there are all sorts of ways that agents can align themselves and get paid
[00:26:00] in legally compliant ways, rest compliant.
[00:26:04] Right, right.
[00:26:05] But DJ, most of it, most of the ways I can teach you, I mean, I'm teaching, I'm doing it with like sometimes you're doing it with no money down because we're real estate,
[00:26:12] we're real estate professionals.
[00:26:13] So like where they may suffer and don't know how to market or they don't have a CRM, they don't understand.
[00:26:20] We already know how to do that as real estate agents.
[00:26:22] That's what our job is.
[00:26:23] We know how to connect people.
[00:26:25] We know how to do social media.
[00:26:28] I mean, all think about all the tools that we have in our tool, it's real estate professionals.
[00:26:32] It makes total sense for us to like you said, we can just we can like I said, do some earned equity within those positions.
[00:26:39] Yes.
[00:26:40] Yeah.
[00:26:40] And in revenue share, that's what I know.
[00:26:43] Yes.
[00:26:44] It's revenue share.
[00:26:45] Yeah.
[00:26:46] So for every vendor that an agent has, they absolutely should reach out again, making sure it's, you know,
[00:26:54] violating license laws.
[00:26:55] Exactly.
[00:26:56] Disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer.
[00:26:57] Find out, find out what what the rules are in your local market and state and and then reach out to, you know,
[00:27:05] the the attorneys reach out to and some people are able to help you in certain ways in some art.
[00:27:11] But if you're sending business to somebody, you should be asking them to do the same at the very least or saying,
[00:27:18] how could I help you?
[00:27:19] For example, if you're very good, if you're strong like you were saying at social media, if that's your thing as an agent, you're really good.
[00:27:25] Well, guess what?
[00:27:26] Most business owners aren't.
[00:27:28] So you have, you know, relationships with inspectors, you know, you know, all these ancillary sort of services, you then can go to those and say, I can help you with that.
[00:27:37] Or let me at least just fire some business off to you and then let's work out an arrangement where, you know, where we can both part, you know, both participate in the profit.
[00:27:45] So I love that.
[00:27:47] Yeah.
[00:27:47] That's that's the new way of doing real estate businesses, you know, how do you make money in between the commissions?
[00:27:54] That's this is what it's looked like looks like, right?
[00:27:57] Because unless we, you know, unless you as a solo agent or even as teams figure out a way to earn multiple streams of revenue, it's going to get tough.
[00:28:06] It's going to continue to get tough in terms of gaining market share.
[00:28:09] These are blue ocean strategies that are out there.
[00:28:12] And like I said, one out of every 12 business owners are just going out of business and we've seen that in COVID.
[00:28:18] And so that's why we're having a hard time finding a handyman reliable handyman.
[00:28:22] And that's where we're having a hard time finding like trussions, HVAC, you know, plumbers, videographers, you know, we're having a hard time finding those people.
[00:28:30] Really encourage everybody to watch South Park just did a in the last month or so.
[00:28:36] They did a special called enter the Pandiverse and and I, and I, one of the plots, one of the subplots of it was that we are so used to having things done for us.
[00:28:47] That these trade positions, these skilled skilled laborer positions, handyman plumbers, etc. painters, you know, people don't a lot of younger people don't aspire to those positions.
[00:28:59] They want like you were saying want to be, you know, more, more involved in technology, be on YouTube, but whatever.
[00:29:04] They're not necessarily wanting seeing that as a viable, you know, sort of career, even though it is a viable career.
[00:29:10] And so as a result, those, those trades are really suffering.
[00:29:13] And, but the need is still there. So you're absolutely right. Like if you think handymen are going out of business.
[00:29:20] Oh my gosh, they're probably having the, they're, they're going to do better and better and better and better because less people are learning those skills.
[00:29:27] And, and we all need to handyman. So, so you're absolutely right. These, these trade jobs are, oh, they're so critical.
[00:29:34] Yeah, yeah, they are so critical, especially for us in, like I said, in our industry because like, yeah, it's, and I talk, you know,
[00:29:42] so I get to talk to these, you know, these handy guys and these trademen and it's, it's been, it's been really, really fun to talk to them and working with their businesses.
[00:29:50] Yeah. Yeah.
[00:29:50] Well, at the end of the South Park episode, the handymen and the, the trade positions, they become the celebrities now because they become the wealthy people.
[00:29:59] So it's, it's this very cute story, but, but it's got a very strong point is, is, you know, we, there are opportunities here to think about, you know,
[00:30:09] sort of services that are not going out of business that are not, you know, the handyman is basically future proof, at least for a long time until robots come in and do it all.
[00:30:19] Yeah, that's a long ways away. So we have, yeah, and maybe, and maybe it will never happen. And there's always going to, you know, in REALTOR's too, you know, REALTOR's are worth their weight in gold.
[00:30:29] If their skill set is high enough, if their skill set is actually valuable about Zillow or, or any of the other, you know, tech providers coming in Redfin Redfin's a better example.
[00:30:41] Yeah, not just slight Redfin, I like Redfin they're great, but they have not really disrupted the market as much as we thought maybe they could.
[00:30:50] And it's not because of anything, you know, negative towards them. It's just people want to talk to agents who, who, you know, and again, they have agents, but we understand it's a little bit of a different.
[00:30:59] relationship there. So yes, so, so what you can do if I understand is you can help agents identify these opportunities and then help create a plan to actually generate, you know, some of these relationships.
[00:31:13] Is that, is that right?
[00:31:14] That is correct. So I help real estate professionals mostly teams, brokerages, you know, title companies, lenders, especially those of us who are, you know, getting up, who either
[00:31:24] who are getting up at age and they don't have a transition plan to how to get out of their business.
[00:31:29] And, and, or those who are growing in want to add multiple streams of revenue to them. And so I have partnerships and JVs.
[00:31:35] And so I, I help these companies create the plans. I help them acquire, acquire either these new businesses or I help them where I help them put in relationships so we can create a create the financial streams for them.
[00:31:48] So that's what I've been doing for like this last year is just because of the ice like well, let me use my relationships with, you know, some of the top lenders title companies and doing it in a respite compliant way.
[00:31:58] And it has been amazing, especially for people just like I said, who've been running their careers and just, you know, most real estate people think they're going to be able to sell their businesses and they're not right they're just you're just not going to.
[00:32:10] And so I teach them how to transition out of it and keep that, I'll keep that income stream coming in.
[00:32:15] And that happened from, you know, started from eXp, you know, I learned that from you know, it's just the business.
[00:32:21] Yeah, yeah.
[00:32:21] Yeah, it's funny. So one of the things I started we started doing here as a recruiting tool and for any of those, any of those who are listening who are either brokerage owners or team owners who are looking to expand their team and hire.
[00:32:36] I've got a great tip for you that you could start doing this in your your local market is offer free headshots and invite the agents from other firms that you're looking for.
[00:32:45] You know recruit or bring on your team or whatever and and and here's how we do it. So because this is exactly to your point.
[00:32:53] Basically what you're doing. So here's how we do this week. We high we get higher this photographer and then I said, well, I don't want to pay for all that by self because it's quite expensive.
[00:33:00] So instead. So now we have an insurance agent that hangs out during the party. We have like a power headshot party.
[00:33:06] We have insurance agent. We have an attorney. We have a lender. We have an inspector and we have a financial advisor.
[00:33:12] And so we have everybody that would love to talk to all of these people. We all share the cost. This is a strategic partnership.
[00:33:20] This is exactly, you know, basically what you're saying is yes, these they're not paying me, but we're all paying the photographer and I only have to pay the talk for a little tiny amount now because.
[00:33:30] And I get to do this event that is pretty cool. People get free headshots. So my point is is this is a way to do a version of that. Like you were saying.
[00:33:38] Is building these these partnerships where you know you're getting in front of the people you want.
[00:33:42] And then hopefully you know either sharing the cost or having somebody even compensate you for some of those efforts.
[00:33:48] And you absolutely could do this. And just to talk about title for one second and I know every state's a little different.
[00:33:54] So I don't want to throw numbers out there that because they wouldn't be applicable to anyone unless they were in our situation.
[00:33:59] But I will tell you as a brokerage owner at least in the state of Illinois, it is major, major revenue for a title deal.
[00:34:08] In other states, it's less but regardless, it's still something.
[00:34:12] And you if you're not figuring out a way to be to participate in that way, you are absolutely leaving money on the table here in Illinois.
[00:34:19] It's big, big money and in other states, it's not as big, but it's still money on the table.
[00:34:24] Right. And it's and it's for doing the things that you already do anyways. And that's what I can't, you know, people like, well, I don't want another job.
[00:34:30] But I don't want to go run a handyman service business. No, I'm teaching I'm teaching you how to do this without you're not going to go pick up hammers.
[00:34:37] You're not going to you're not going to you're not going to go, you know, have to become a virtual assistant yourself for any of this is like these are ways that you can do this with with up, you know, with operate, operational, operational lies control, right?
[00:34:51] Like that like it's just putting people put butts in seats to make sure that work gets done because that's what your job is to do is a, you know, as a team, if you're a team leader, it's your job is to make sure the work gets done.
[00:35:00] Yeah. It's quarterback.
[00:35:01] And as as an agent to, you know, you should be cultivating these relationships with your vendors anyway and talk about saying, Hey, I would like us to be a more strategic partner and figure out how we can help each other next year.
[00:35:15] So yeah, I'm happy to continue to send you business, Mr. Mrs. Vender.
[00:35:19] And I'd like you to be more part of the team as opposed to just a vendor for me. So what can we do together where, you know, we can both participate in in the success of this.
[00:35:30] And I'm going to refer every single person who comes my way to you. And I'd love to hear about, you know, maybe what you can do on your end to help facilitate more deals for me or maybe some marketing dollars or whatever again is respite compliant and, you know, license lock applying.
[00:35:45] But there are ways to do this. And agents are oftentimes not as confident to ask. They don't know exactly what to ask for.
[00:35:55] You know, I think most agents understand well, I can ask my lender to help me with like a seminar or a webinar or a science or we understand that because we we've been taught how to do that.
[00:36:05] But we haven't been taught how to do the other stuff. And this is where you come in because this is what you teach.
[00:36:10] Yeah, it's critical because this is why you would go to fee because you don't try to reinvent the wheel. Don't try to learn it all yourself.
[00:36:19] Go to somebody who's already figured it out like fee and have have her help consult with you and give you some suggestions because she already knows how to do it.
[00:36:27] Yeah, yeah, it's been amazing. Yeah, people think on the outside. Yeah, there's some, you know, there's some nuances and intricacies, but we've now done it, you know, done it across the country and now.
[00:36:37] And it's, it's, yeah, and you're right. It varies from law to law, you know, from state to state. There are different laws about different things.
[00:36:43] But yeah, I loved it. Help anybody who's in who would love, you know, I'm open to talking to anybody who's interested in looking down that path. Yeah.
[00:36:50] And there is really even if the, for example, even like even with utility companies like cable phone for people that still use cable and phone.
[00:37:01] People still do. And they do. Yeah.
[00:37:04] Yeah. And, you know, this is an opportunity to reach out to the cable company and be like, Hey, can I get a spiff on every time I send someone over to you and make again, whatever the rules are in your area.
[00:37:15] Fine. But most, most of them be like, sure, I'd be happy to solar is another one. There's lots of of, of, you know,
[00:37:22] Yeah, home renovators, staging companies, et cetera, so many opportunities.
[00:37:27] I've got a price list of the average of those. And so the ones that you'd be just most shocked on is like utilities.
[00:37:33] It's the average household for utility. And I don't even have to hear. But I think if I remember off the top of my head in like the state of Texas is is $1,300.
[00:37:40] Well, you get a referral of that. They'll give you up to 30 or 40% referral on that. Think about that. I mean, you know, I mean, just like, yeah, people aren't paying about utilities.
[00:37:49] I mean, there's so many like you said solar. Oh my gosh. If, you know, if they have solar in your in your state, but it's it's being compliant. Right. It's the rest of the compliant ways and and how you build that. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's, it can be very, very, very, it's very, very lucrative.
[00:38:03] And attorneys have been doing this for years and years and years attorneys have referral relationships with other attorneys who are in different specialties.
[00:38:11] Obviously REALTORS do this. Oh, my clients moving to Florida and I live in Illinois. So I need to find someone in Florida. And I'm going to take X percentage of the commission by handing, you know, you an agent down there, the deal.
[00:38:22] And yes, you can do similar versions of this. And you, I love the thing you were saying to about this hyper locals that where you could go to businesses in your local market and say, look, I have, I have a following on online of people that, you know, no like and trust me.
[00:38:40] They listen to my suggestions. And I'm happy to sort of drive business to you, Mr. Mrs. Business owner.
[00:38:48] Would that be okay? Of course, the answer is going to be yes. And then, and then the question is great. Can we either work out a relationship where maybe, you know, I, maybe there's a revenue share like you were saying or maybe we can reciprocally send each other business.
[00:39:02] But I think, you know, business owners love this idea of, oh, you're going to help me grow my business. Awesome. Let's, and you know, they understand the nature of the recipe. The reciprocity of that.
[00:39:13] Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And there's, yeah. And there's, so there's three ways that people can generate business that way. So I call it like one being an affiliate, right? Like we talked about like you could possibly get income to being.
[00:39:24] We call just a connect a connector like where you, you as the real estate professional look really good by being able to offer that higher level tier services on it. And you may get a discount yourself. And then three is like absolutely.
[00:39:37] You know, you're going to the, you become a professional. You are sharing a revenues or you might own or you do performance guarantees. You know, get some performance bonuses on stuff and, and you revenue share. So those are three different tiers. And I've got about four other tiers of way you can, ways you can, you can do that. Yeah.
[00:39:54] I mean, we're, and what are we talking about sort of bottom line on a transaction if a, and again, I, you know, numbers are going to vary wildly. But we're talking about possibly adding.
[00:40:07] A thousand or more dollars in rev in profit to even a transaction.
[00:40:13] Possibly possibly or more.
[00:40:16] Or more or more.
[00:40:18] Yes. Yes. I was being very conservative because I know, I know even what title gives us per deal here in Illinois. But which is, which is thousands.
[00:40:27] Right. That's also not titled. Yeah. Just on, yeah, just on just just a title mortgage.
[00:40:34] If you just think about, we talked about remember we said up to 41 different ways you can get paid on a transaction. Okay, let's just say you got paid on three more.
[00:40:41] Just just imagine you got just paid on those just three the basic, the basic core three. Let's just say it's mortgage handyman services or housekeeping services. I don't know. I mean, you know, you pick three. It's way more than you did before and it's doing the exact same.
[00:40:56] You're all right. You know, we all like it's funny. I, um, I have a, uh, how do we find our, our, the people that, you know, we hire to clean our homes on a regular basis. Well, yes, we could go online and try to find.
[00:41:10] But we usually ask our friends, right? We go, who's your cleaning person? Are they good?
[00:41:14] Yeah. Okay. They're not still.
[00:41:17] Yeah.
[00:41:18] Yeah. Right. Yeah. But those people are worth their weight in gold when you can find a good cleaning anyone, any vendor that's, that's excellent. We're like, oh my gosh.
[00:41:27] And, and, you know, people just freely sort of give out those referrals. And that's awesome. And you should do that. And you should also say, gosh, I want to help build your business. You are such an excellent vendor. I want to help you.
[00:41:39] And that's where you start is how can we help each other? And agents are just not used to asking that question. And this is the question.
[00:41:47] And, and fees going to help you not only identify all these opportunities and possibly becoming an equity partner in some of their businesses or some sort of, you know, affiliate or referral relationship, whatever.
[00:41:58] There's ways to do it. And whether you're getting paid, maybe you're getting paid in sweat equity. Maybe you're getting paid not in physical dollars, but services for your business that can, you know, maybe there's, by the way,
[00:42:11] accountants, those are pretty important people, right? So accountants is another opportunity. And I know they're on your list.
[00:42:17] Yeah.
[00:42:17] You've identified everyone. So this is exactly, guys, I think this is a perfect place for us to stop because if you haven't built some of these strategic partnerships and relationships to earn more than just a commission on a sale.
[00:42:31] And yes, that's, we understand that's how agents get paid. But there are other avenues. And fee is going to help you figure out how to do that.
[00:42:40] How to identify and how to approach those businesses and what to offer them and what to expect in return. And guys, it like fee was saying, you're already referring people to other vendors anyway.
[00:42:52] You might as well see if there's an opportunity to work together. And, you know, it's, you just, you've opened my eyes actually because I'm kind of a business owner myself.
[00:43:01] So I now have to start looking at our strategic partnerships and realize, oh, yeah, maybe I'm, I'm leaving some things on the table. In fact, I know I'm leaving. In fact, I'm going to ask feed. I'll take a look at my podcast and tell me how I'm leaving things on the table because I totally won a trillion percent and leaving money on the table.
[00:43:19] So I'm doing it guys. You're doing it. We're all doing it.
[00:43:22] So fee is here to save us all. So find for all things fee. Just find her on Instagram. She's, she's, she's, she's defined search fee gentry online. There's not, there's one fee gentry. And that is her.
[00:43:34] Which is one of the cool things about having a name like fee gentry is a name that you certainly remember in this unique. And fee is really the real deal again.
[00:43:42] And been on the board of directors and eXp she's, she's, she's, she's the real thing. Author coach athlete and a top producer and broker a donor, just everything she's done it all. So please reach out to her because she knows where this business is headed because she has been at those upper levels in management at the really the highest levels of some of the biggest companies out there. So guys, she, she knows she, she knows what's what's coming and she wants to help you future proof. So find her on Instagram at fee gentry.
[00:44:12] She's the FEE, GE and TRI. And we'll have links to all of fees, ways to get in contact, whether in our show notes. But I would just want to thank fee for spending an hour with us. We so much appreciate you. You are such a wonderful guest.
[00:44:27] And you have such a passion for helping agents, which is exactly what the show is all about. So on behalf of the audience, thank you. Thank you to fee. This is a wonderful way for me. This is my last interview before the before I go on holiday break. So what a what a fun interview for me to have. So selfishly, thank you for.
[00:44:45] But our audience also thanks you. And then on behalf of fee and myself, we want to thank the audience to you. Stuck around to the very end. We appreciate you. We honor you. This is for you. So thank you.
[00:44:56] Tell us how we can improve the show. Number one, leave us a review. Let us know good, bad and different. Let us know what we want more or less of. Tell me to shut up. Whatever. Let me know how to break the show better. But also support our sponsors. They're the ones that pay the bills. So please check out their products and services. I promise you, we I do not allow.
[00:45:14] So vendors to come on and be advertisers unless they have unbelievable services for agents and telefront. Please tell a friend about our show. Another agent in your office. They need to hear this. By the way, your owner of if you're an agent and you work for a brokerage instead of being the brokerage owner. Send this to the owner because the owner needs to know about this as well.
[00:45:33] The owner needs to know or the team lead needs to understand there is opportunities and they already know it. They just don't have the strategy about how to get there.
[00:45:42] Fees going to help them do that. So reach out to fee. She's awesome. We'll have her contact information in the show notes. Find her on Instagram at Fiji Entry.
[00:45:52] I'm just going to say have a wonderful holiday season in here. I know I can't wait. I don't have anything good planned. I plan on traveling. But I'm going to be actually just focusing down and rebranding and doing some new stuff. So yeah.
[00:46:04] By the way, too. We were joking about this before. I think of the best voice ever. She is just the supposed soothing voice. So I said if you're going to hire a consultant, you're going to have somebody work with you.
[00:46:15] Wouldn't it be cool to have somebody with a voice like fee? Well, you might just be directly. So in fact, I need a strategic partnership with Fiji. I'm only teasing. But I am happy to promote fee because she's wonderful and very, very skilled.
[00:46:27] But she also has a wonderful voice and she hosts shows and she does it all. So reach out to her. She will get you on the right track. Fees, thank you so much. We will see everybody on the next episode.

It's very cool. But let's just get right to it. My conversation with fee gentry. Today we have fee gentry on the show as our guest from eXp in Georgetown, Texas. Let me tell you more about fee. Now fee gentry is a dynamic figure in real estate. She excels as an entrepreneur and investor, speaker, a coach and an author. She's the visionary founder of the Black eXp network, a co-founder of the one eXp initiative and a former director on the board of eXp World Holdings LLC.

With over two decades of entrepreneurial experience, fee is the driving change both within and beyond the real estate sector. She's currently the CEO of Live Better Ventures, running a business incubator and hosts the fellowship on YouTube. Now for all things fee, we want you actually to go to her Instagram, which is at fee gentry. Feed, welcome to the show. Well, thank you, DJ. Man, I was like, when you were reading that, I was like, who's he talking about? Who's that amazing person? Who's that lady? He sounds like she sounds like she sounds like she sounds like she's a little superstar. Well, you are a superstar and I am excited to, number one, you're such a sweet person. We were just chatting backstage and I'm really, really excited to speak with you. But besides being just a pleasant and lovely person, I really want to, you have some really great things we're going to talk about today, specifically money that REALTORS are leaving on the table. And also with the talk of AI and just technology always, you know, increasing and trying to edge out REALTORS, what we can do to future proof our businesses. So we're going to talk a lot about that. But before we get to that, to that, let's talk about you. And I'd love to hear about how you got into real estate because you have done a lot. So tell us about that journey. Man, real estate DJ was like plan F for me. Like I had, it was nowhere on my radar. I mean, actually I was in physical therapy school. So I had, you know, my goal was to be a physical therapist. And I, you know, so I went to PT school, you know, I did post rehabilitation. I mean, that was, you know, fitness. That was my career. And we should mention for anyone, I'm sorry to interrupt your lovely story. But just to make a big deal about this, PT school is often talked about as being just as challenging to get into as pre-med because there's, there's fewer actually PT schools than there are mescoles. And I don't know if that's still the case, but it is a big deal to get into a PT program. And so, yeah, I'm sorry. So tell us tell us. Yeah. So I was, yeah, so I was in the number one physical therapy program in the state of Texas. And I just, boom, I just said, this is not for me. Like because I had, you know, it was just weird. And I was on, and I've always been an entrepreneur since the age of like 9, 10, 11 years old, I've always had businesses. So I, you know, read this little book like a lot of people have, right? That book called Rich Dad Poor Dad by Kia Sox. Sure. And you know, that one little sentence says that 90% of people, of million, you know, of millionaires or people who have wealth are in the real estate business. I didn't see the sales part. I just saw in the real estate business. So silly me, my mom was building a house in central Texas site unseen. And so her REALTOR was like, and who also happened to be the commissioner of the state of Texas was like, we, I came to meet, you know, check on, check on the house and meet with him. And he said, you would be really good in real estate. He was on to introduce you to one of my friends who happened to be the, and she was there. I didn't know who it was. Avis Wukash, having to be the commissioner of the state of Texas. And they're like, you could be top 1% and I was like, eh, you know, I just didn't even listen to them and I blew it off. And I thought about it for a while and I start having all these people recruit me into the real estate industry and I promised you DJ. I did not know a, you know, a listing from a lock box. I got the business. I had no clue. And so first year I sold 39 homes unbeknownst to me. I thought it sucked. I didn't, I was like, because I got this, I got this little bronze medal. I was at the big red company, you know, KW. And I got this bronze medal. I was like, eh, how do I get a silver? I mean, how do I get a gold bronze? That's the worst of all the medals. Great. It really made it on the podium. And if you don't know this about me, but I'm 5'11", almost 6' tall. So my, you know, former collegiate athlete loves sports. So I'm like, very competitive. So that's how I got in the business of real estate. And so I just grew from there. So I went from being a solo agent that I grew that I became like a, I was in a smaller town. I was living up north. And so I was kind of like this medium-sized fish in a small pond and start growing a team of people and then wanted to start. I wanted to, you know, own a franchise and that didn't work out. Thank God, because 2008 then happened. Good time. Save myself. But I still, I mean, I still took a blood bath like everybody else. But, but yeah, so that's how I ended the business. Yeah. Wow. That is, that's quite a story. And your story doesn't end there because from there you went on to serve and management capacities at the corporate level, you know, with eXp in particular and just, you know, continually coaching, consulting, writing, you do it all and it is, it's so impressive. And there's so much we could talk about. And I think, you know, being that you were so connected to agents, I would love to talk about, you know, 2024. This episode might not actually publish until early January or potentially late December, but regardless, it'll be, you know, 2024 is on everybody's mind. No matter when this actually drops. But people had a tough 2023 or at least the most of the agents I knew. I have just so often I talk to an agent that I'm having my best year ever. I was maybe 1% of the agents I talked to. So, so for most of us, it was a, it was a tricky and difficult year. And I think, you know, for somebody like yourself who's so disciplined, so focused, so just committed to finding solutions. I really do want to talk about what agents can do in 2024. Just to help keep their, keep stay in business and keep their business rolling forward. So just any advice or guidance that you might have for what agents should be focusing on right now during the winter months when we know things are slower anyway. But how they could set themselves up for possibly having a better 2024 or 2025. Right. That is an amazing question. And I get that question a lot and I talk about that a lot. We wish we'd have started in October. So the people that I work with, we say, let's start in October that 90 day window. Right. But since since we can't do anything about it, let's start today. So what can you do today? And I always talk about what do you need to do right now to future proof your business. Right for 2024. So that and I, and so my goal here for your audience is just to help set them free. Right. Free from, you know, worry about artificial intelligence taking over. Free from, you know, the tax from these major, you know, institutional investors. And I want to set them free from any other outside forces because the first part that that we ought to talk about is let's set their, let's get their mind in check. Right. So I want them to, I don't want to be a victim of the economy. I want them to, you know, first of all, let's talk about your mindset. You have to make a decision. So that's the very first thing I talked to people about. Make a decision that you should thrive in 2024. Number two is to have a plan. Like, and not a plan and people keep writing business plans, but I'm talking about an action plan. Because we, we all feel good about planning. Oh, well, I wrote my business plan for 2024. Well, what are you going to do? What are the action steps that you're going to take in the first 30 days? And I always talk about this is keep it simple. We write these elaborate business plans and I'm just talking to people about in 2024. We're going to just have to keep it simple. Like and go back to the basics and the fundamentals of of everything. Yes, we need to leverage artificial intelligence and learn how to use that. But we need to leverage it. And why I'm calling collective capitalism is or collective, you know, or collaborative capitalism this year. That's what people should be focusing on in 2024. Who it's not what you need to do or how to do it. Who do you need to connect with in order to get through the next year to two years and possibly even three years? Because I believe this is the, you know, according to fee disclaimer, right? These are just my own thoughts. I believe that real estate is going to substantially change. In the next 24 to 48 months, whether it's from the Department of Justice, you know, the court cases or whether it's, you know, technology or the consumers who've just decided, we've just they want they've got a different feed and they want to and they want to do something or the collapse of NAR. I mean, I don't know. No, I know Crystal Ball. But either way, like I said, my goal is to set your audience free to do something different this year. Thank you. And I think by the way, a wonderful goal and very appreciative to you to come on here and and share some of your wisdom and knowledge. And we should, you know, I was thinking as you were saying about keeping it simple. So I recruit agents for a living and our audience, a lot of them don't do that. But I think you can pass our audience can possibly relate to this little quick story. So for years and years every week, we'd have a management meeting and it would they would say DJ, how many people did you hire this week? And that was our measure of how well DJ I was doing. And I've been doing this 13 years. So that's just a standard metric. It's like how many sales did you get? You know, that kind of thing. But it was how many people did I recruit? And then we finally realized that what we call our key performance indicators, that's just the end result of me doing all the other tasks. And so, you know, assuming that I never get better at recruiting, what is the actual driver? It's how many conversations do I have on a daily basis? So it reminds me of that Brian Bafini, old Brian Bafini thing that where he would say you got to meet two to five people every day if you're a REALTOR and just add them to your database. And I was like, well, and there's a lot more to it, of course. But if we're looking at the most basic activity that a REALTOR should probably consider if they don't have enough business right now is keep adding people to your database, keep having conversations, meet new people, get them into your CRM. And so for me, I don't focus on how many people I recruited anymore. It's how many conversations that I have this week with agents. And then, you know, we track my close ratio and all of that. But really what we're following on is we know DJ needs to talk to 20 different agents a week if he's going to get, you know, five people to join or whatever. So, so I really appreciate you saying that because we can look at the end result sales, you know, deals closed and go, and then we can go, that's a lot of stress. If we go back to just, I got to beat a whole bunch of people and I go, and that's not the only thing anyone needs to do. But it's, it's a way to think about scaling back your, you know, what do I actually need to do on a daily basis? Absolutely. That's the one if you do nothing else. That's it. If you never improve your skill set, I mean, this is what I always say too. Like with me, if I never become any better as a recruiter, if I just double the number of people I talk to, in theory, I should double the number of recruits that I have. And of course, we're going to get everything. But, but yeah, so, so let's, let's talk a little bit more. So, so thinking about, yes, there's all of these outside factors, you know, you mentioned technology. We talk about the rise of AI, the flight to teams, there's lawsuits, there's all these things that, and I want to go back to mindset just for a moment because I was curious of what your advice is for you. You talked about first making a decision that I'm going to have a good next 12 months. Yes. How do you protect that mindset? Because we know that it's, you know, when things are good, it's easy to have the mindset. When things are strong, are challenging, it's harder. So, do you have any any, any suggestions to protect that mindset and really guard it so that some of these outside influences don't start to color it in a way that we now are, oh my gosh, oh, this isn't going to happen. Yeah, I am 100% my own best credit, my own best person at that. Number one, I always do is like turn off the television, get off social media, and then get away from negative people. And what are all those three things have people? And it's kind of weird. Like we're supposed to talk to people. So, like, yes, like want you to have conversations, but with the right type of people, right? But it's so, but in the other thing that I do is I have, you know, I have a lot of my friends or colleagues were all learners. So, we're, you know, we're staying atop of books. So, we're reading books on mindset, on, you know, manifestation or money or prayer, whatever it is that you believe in. Find something that you can do every single day that takes you out of this crazy world and brings you back inward. Because we keep looking at these external forces. Everything we need is already inside of us. And so, that's the number one thing that I really recommend is for people to go inward when everybody else is being crazy. Yeah, and also we can get crazy too. And so, this idea of, of having a practice, some sort of discipline, like you were saying prayer, meditation, whatever it is, something that takes you a little bit outside of the craziness that we all deal with inside our own heads too. This is, it gives some additional space in our lives to be able to say, you know what? There's more than just me out here. I'm somehow connecting with this, you know, greater thing that's not just me. And it's a nice respite from sometimes our own struggles that we have. So, I'm a big, big fan of that and big believer in that as well. And also, I think it's the birthplace of creativity. I think when you can get quiet and listen to your intuition, like you were saying that sometimes, and a lot of times the answer is bubble, bubble up. But if you're not quiet, I don't, if I'm not quiet, I don't hear them. Me neither. Yeah, yeah. I just, I absolutely just, like, I'm, I do that twice a day. I just get quiet twice a day or with something, you know, and I always recommend, finding that piece for me. It's like either putting my feet in the grass, looking at water, something like that, like connecting with nature, connecting with your inner, you know, your, your source, whatever you need to do music, but just find, like, find that internal piece is, is really, really key. Yeah. Yeah. And the other thing too that I think about, I'm curious to get your, your take on it is this, it's an old expression, but I think it's accurate, at least for me, that the journey is really, is really where it's at. The destination is nice and it's nice to celebrate. And you know, when we, when we have these major goals, we accomplish, it's great for a day or two to sort of celebrate. And then I don't know, but I often, well, I'll, for me, I often get depressed when I, when I achieve a goal. And I, which I didn't know was very common. I can get really, really depressed because then I'm like, oh, now, okay, now what? You know, and then it's like, I got to just, and if I, if I were to think about, yes, the goal is nice. And we should celebrate our, our wins. And then we should realize it's all about chopping wood and carrying water just consistently doing, doing the work. Yeah. Yeah, that's, that's it. DJ, I'm glad you mentioned that because I call it's the mom of mentality. There's a lot of us, especially in the real estate industry, or like, like I said, you know, as it be in an athlete or something. So I think about Kobe Bryant, it's that, you know, after the championships, he goes back and he's looking at game film and shooting a thousand shots. After he's won a championship, I'm that girl, you know, I'm that girl too. And so the journey, as I've gotten older and I'm, and I've started learning and appreciate patients and enjoying just the little things like the, just the habit of practice. We're just about practice, right? Just practice and enjoying that journey. But man, it took me three years plus. I mean, just taking me a long time. I was talking to my personal trainer the other week or two ago. And I was saying, I'm just going to have to throw myself in the way of pain, physical pain for the rest of my life. If I want to be fit, there's nothing pleasant to me about like lifting heavy weights. It's painful. It hurts. It's, but he, the results are pretty cool. But I have to be willing to go through the discomfort and the willing, I mean, tell muscles grow. It's how we grow as people. So this idea of like throwing ourselves into discomfort is, is not fun. But it seems to be the only way I know to do it. So this idea of getting into habits, you know, and just like, I don't like working out, but I do it. I don't, I don't have to like it. I just do it. Yeah, it's about, yeah, it's about creating habits. That's why I was talking about, you know, when you're making people making plans and goals, no, you need to just develop habits. That's the number one thing James clears book is probably one of the books that I recommend more than anything is atomic habits, long read. And in the way he builds that book, it's creating habit, right? I mean, when the way that we even lays out the book, so yeah, it's creating habits of man. Like you said, it sucks, but you just, you just do it. Yeah, and here's, here's the good news. I was thinking about this with exercise. So I don't like exercise. Some people do. I truly, I know some people actually really do love it. So I'm only speaking for myself, but I never did enjoy lifting heavy weights and, you know, even doing cardio is not my favorite thing. But if I want to, if I want to live a long life, I probably have to do those things. So I finally just said, well, I got to do it. I don't have to like it. I just have to do it. And so if you have parts of your business that you don't like to do, but are critical, then you can start to think about, do I have to force myself? Sometimes the answer may be yes, or it may be I can leverage other someone else to maybe do something for me because number one, I don't like doing it or number two. I'm not good at it. And there's all these ways now to get people to help you. We have a global economy. We have this gig economy that we can tap into and get help from people in other places that, you know, maybe charge less than what people locally would charge to do similar work. And if you're having problems staying on top of your habits, yeah, well, maybe get some help or get an accountability partner. But I want to talk a little bit about future proofing one's business and this idea of having leaving money on the, sorry, leaving money on the table because I think this is something that most agents don't think about at all. They're just focused on the next transaction, the next client, and there are a lot of opportunities. I, as somebody who is in management at a brokerage, you know, this is a huge focus for brokerage owners right now, but it also can be something that teams, agents, they really should be thinking about additional streams of income. So let's talk about that. Yeah, so this is probably one of my favorite things to talk about. And I've been talking about it for a long period of time. So DJ, most real estate professionals are renting their careers. Let me say that again, most real estate professionals are renting their careers. They're going from transaction to transaction. They're doing, you know, they're, they're, they might be at a brokerage where is they have unfavorable terms. And then the other parts of the money that they're leaving on the table. So I want you to imagine this and I always kind of do this exercise. Draw circles. So if somebody's watching this, do this as I'm talking about it. Write a circle, put your name in the middle of it. What do wrote most real estate agents do? Like how many people, how many people get paid during a real estate transaction? So let's, let's just start naming them. Who gets paid during a real estate transaction? The REALTOR. The REALTORS, both so buyer seller side, the buyer sellers, the brokerage gets paid. The title, title company gets paid. The lender gets paid. Right. Video inspector. Yep. Home inspector. The utility companies get paid if it's sometimes movers, movers, movers. Yeah. You to videographer, stagers, the state, the state, the state, you know, the state records county clerk's. So DJ, when I do this, I have found that on one single transaction, up to 41 people get paid off of one transaction. And guess who's in the middle of that transaction? Yeah, the agent, the agent. And that's what I talk about leaving money on the table. We are now when you talked about that gig economy. We have the ability now as entrepreneurs. We have to stop being self employed. I'm talking to people about be going from solo to CEO or being self employed to real estate business owner. And a lot of people think they're real estate business owners and they're not. They are self employed. And so the entrepreneur of the future is going to have to stop leaving money on the table. And there are, you know, compliant ways for you to get paid, especially from title, from from from mortgage company, you know, from mortgages, because you're watching the brokers do it. I mean, our brokerages are doing that in the models of, you know, so now in the future. And it's nothing new, but it's a different way to look at it. Look at it. If you keep saying that you're lindering my lending partner, if you're lending partners, not providing you resources or an ability to get paid or something, that's not your partner. That's just a vendor. And so we just. Just a vendor. Yep. It's just a vendor. And so there are so many different ways to get paid on the table. If you're, we have, you know, we have real estate professionals who have you can own a vending company. We have real estate. I mean, you know, I'm sorry, but a staging company. We have we have real estate owners who own who can become, you know, property managers, you know, what, you know, yeah, check your local. But there's so many. Sure. Sure. I'm looking right now in this country. We have 30,000 baby boomers retiring every day in junior wants to be a YouTube star. He doesn't want to own a plumbing company, a H back company. He doesn't care about being a property manager, but we have the ability to go ahead and buy our cashflow. We as real estate professionals can buy our cashflow. We keep creating these companies and doing these transactions, but we can create, we can buy cleaning companies. We can buy move out companies. I mean, there's so many different ways right now for us to make money. And we're leaving $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 a month on the table. So that's what I've been doing lately is either buying into equity, so creating equity positions with companies who who already service the real estate industry, where they're handyman companies. I've got a landscaping company, tile and grout company, all those get paid off of a real estate transaction, by the way. And that's where that's where there's the opportunity. And so especially those in the real estate businesses like who are, you know, bigger teams, you're already utilizing these services. You know, the moving services, moving trucks. I mean, moving companies, there's so many opportunities like we talked about the 41 ways that people up to 41 ways, people get paid off of one single real estate transaction. That's how you're leaving money off on the table. I love that. And this idea of investing and taking some of your capital, your commission money, for example, and reinvesting it into another business where you have an equity position. And yes, there are all sorts of ways that agents can align themselves and get paid in legally compliant ways, rest compliant. Right, right. But DJ, most of it, most of the ways I can teach you, I mean, I'm teaching, I'm doing it with like sometimes you're doing it with no money down because we're real estate, we're real estate professionals. So like where they may suffer and don't know how to market or they don't have a CRM, they don't understand. We already know how to do that as real estate agents. That's what our job is. We know how to connect people. We know how to do social media. I mean, all think about all the tools that we have in our tool, it's real estate professionals. It makes total sense for us to like you said, we can just we can like I said, do some earned equity within those positions. Yes. Yeah. And in revenue share, that's what I know. Yes. It's revenue share. Yeah. So for every vendor that an agent has, they absolutely should reach out again, making sure it's, you know, violating license laws. Exactly. Disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer. Find out, find out what what the rules are in your local market and state and and then reach out to, you know, the the attorneys reach out to and some people are able to help you in certain ways in some art. But if you're sending business to somebody, you should be asking them to do the same at the very least or saying, how could I help you? For example, if you're very good, if you're strong like you were saying at social media, if that's your thing as an agent, you're really good. Well, guess what? Most business owners aren't. So you have, you know, relationships with inspectors, you know, you know, all these ancillary sort of services, you then can go to those and say, I can help you with that. Or let me at least just fire some business off to you and then let's work out an arrangement where, you know, where we can both part, you know, both participate in the profit. So I love that. Yeah. That's that's the new way of doing real estate businesses, you know, how do you make money in between the commissions? That's this is what it's looked like looks like, right? Because unless we, you know, unless you as a solo agent or even as teams figure out a way to earn multiple streams of revenue, it's going to get tough. It's going to continue to get tough in terms of gaining market share. These are blue ocean strategies that are out there. And like I said, one out of every 12 business owners are just going out of business and we've seen that in COVID. And so that's why we're having a hard time finding a handyman reliable handyman. And that's where we're having a hard time finding like trussions, HVAC, you know, plumbers, videographers, you know, we're having a hard time finding those people. Really encourage everybody to watch South Park just did a in the last month or so. They did a special called enter the Pandiverse and and I, and I, one of the plots, one of the subplots of it was that we are so used to having things done for us. That these trade positions, these skilled skilled laborer positions, handyman plumbers, etc. painters, you know, people don't a lot of younger people don't aspire to those positions. They want like you were saying want to be, you know, more, more involved in technology, be on YouTube, but whatever. They're not necessarily wanting seeing that as a viable, you know, sort of career, even though it is a viable career. And so as a result, those, those trades are really suffering. And, but the need is still there. So you're absolutely right. Like if you think handymen are going out of business. Oh my gosh, they're probably having the, they're, they're going to do better and better and better and better because less people are learning those skills. And, and we all need to handyman. So, so you're absolutely right. These, these trade jobs are, oh, they're so critical. Yeah, yeah, they are so critical, especially for us in, like I said, in our industry because like, yeah, it's, and I talk, you know, so I get to talk to these, you know, these handy guys and these trademen and it's, it's been, it's been really, really fun to talk to them and working with their businesses. Yeah. Yeah. Well, at the end of the South Park episode, the handymen and the, the trade positions, they become the celebrities now because they become the wealthy people. So it's, it's this very cute story, but, but it's got a very strong point is, is, you know, we, there are opportunities here to think about, you know, sort of services that are not going out of business that are not, you know, the handyman is basically future proof, at least for a long time until robots come in and do it all. Yeah, that's a long ways away. So we have, yeah, and maybe, and maybe it will never happen. And there's always going to, you know, in REALTOR's too, you know, REALTOR's are worth their weight in gold. If their skill set is high enough, if their skill set is actually valuable about Zillow or, or any of the other, you know, tech providers coming in Redfin Redfin's a better example. Yeah, not just slight Redfin, I like Redfin they're great, but they have not really disrupted the market as much as we thought maybe they could. And it's not because of anything, you know, negative towards them. It's just people want to talk to agents who, who, you know, and again, they have agents, but we understand it's a little bit of a different. relationship there. So yes, so, so what you can do if I understand is you can help agents identify these opportunities and then help create a plan to actually generate, you know, some of these relationships. Is that, is that right? That is correct. So I help real estate professionals mostly teams, brokerages, you know, title companies, lenders, especially those of us who are, you know, getting up, who either who are getting up at age and they don't have a transition plan to how to get out of their business. And, and, or those who are growing in want to add multiple streams of revenue to them. And so I have partnerships and JVs. And so I, I help these companies create the plans. I help them acquire, acquire either these new businesses or I help them where I help them put in relationships so we can create a create the financial streams for them. So that's what I've been doing for like this last year is just because of the ice like well, let me use my relationships with, you know, some of the top lenders title companies and doing it in a respite compliant way. And it has been amazing, especially for people just like I said, who've been running their careers and just, you know, most real estate people think they're going to be able to sell their businesses and they're not right they're just you're just not going to. And so I teach them how to transition out of it and keep that, I'll keep that income stream coming in. And that happened from, you know, started from eXp, you know, I learned that from you know, it's just the business. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's funny. So one of the things I started we started doing here as a recruiting tool and for any of those, any of those who are listening who are either brokerage owners or team owners who are looking to expand their team and hire. I've got a great tip for you that you could start doing this in your your local market is offer free headshots and invite the agents from other firms that you're looking for. You know recruit or bring on your team or whatever and and and here's how we do it. So because this is exactly to your point. Basically what you're doing. So here's how we do this week. We high we get higher this photographer and then I said, well, I don't want to pay for all that by self because it's quite expensive. So instead. So now we have an insurance agent that hangs out during the party. We have like a power headshot party. We have insurance agent. We have an attorney. We have a lender. We have an inspector and we have a financial advisor. And so we have everybody that would love to talk to all of these people. We all share the cost. This is a strategic partnership. This is exactly, you know, basically what you're saying is yes, these they're not paying me, but we're all paying the photographer and I only have to pay the talk for a little tiny amount now because. And I get to do this event that is pretty cool. People get free headshots. So my point is is this is a way to do a version of that. Like you were saying. Is building these these partnerships where you know you're getting in front of the people you want. And then hopefully you know either sharing the cost or having somebody even compensate you for some of those efforts. And you absolutely could do this. And just to talk about title for one second and I know every state's a little different. So I don't want to throw numbers out there that because they wouldn't be applicable to anyone unless they were in our situation. But I will tell you as a brokerage owner at least in the state of Illinois, it is major, major revenue for a title deal. In other states, it's less but regardless, it's still something. And you if you're not figuring out a way to be to participate in that way, you are absolutely leaving money on the table here in Illinois. It's big, big money and in other states, it's not as big, but it's still money on the table. Right. And it's and it's for doing the things that you already do anyways. And that's what I can't, you know, people like, well, I don't want another job. But I don't want to go run a handyman service business. No, I'm teaching I'm teaching you how to do this without you're not going to go pick up hammers. You're not going to you're not going to you're not going to go, you know, have to become a virtual assistant yourself for any of this is like these are ways that you can do this with with up, you know, with operate, operational, operational lies control, right? Like that like it's just putting people put butts in seats to make sure that work gets done because that's what your job is to do is a, you know, as a team, if you're a team leader, it's your job is to make sure the work gets done. Yeah. It's quarterback. And as as an agent to, you know, you should be cultivating these relationships with your vendors anyway and talk about saying, Hey, I would like us to be a more strategic partner and figure out how we can help each other next year. So yeah, I'm happy to continue to send you business, Mr. Mrs. Vender. And I'd like you to be more part of the team as opposed to just a vendor for me. So what can we do together where, you know, we can both participate in in the success of this. And I'm going to refer every single person who comes my way to you. And I'd love to hear about, you know, maybe what you can do on your end to help facilitate more deals for me or maybe some marketing dollars or whatever again is respite compliant and, you know, license lock applying. But there are ways to do this. And agents are oftentimes not as confident to ask. They don't know exactly what to ask for. You know, I think most agents understand well, I can ask my lender to help me with like a seminar or a webinar or a science or we understand that because we we've been taught how to do that. But we haven't been taught how to do the other stuff. And this is where you come in because this is what you teach. Yeah, it's critical because this is why you would go to fee because you don't try to reinvent the wheel. Don't try to learn it all yourself. Go to somebody who's already figured it out like fee and have have her help consult with you and give you some suggestions because she already knows how to do it. Yeah, yeah, it's been amazing. Yeah, people think on the outside. Yeah, there's some, you know, there's some nuances and intricacies, but we've now done it, you know, done it across the country and now. And it's, it's, yeah, and you're right. It varies from law to law, you know, from state to state. There are different laws about different things. But yeah, I loved it. Help anybody who's in who would love, you know, I'm open to talking to anybody who's interested in looking down that path. Yeah. And there is really even if the, for example, even like even with utility companies like cable phone for people that still use cable and phone. People still do. And they do. Yeah. Yeah. And, you know, this is an opportunity to reach out to the cable company and be like, Hey, can I get a spiff on every time I send someone over to you and make again, whatever the rules are in your area. Fine. But most, most of them be like, sure, I'd be happy to solar is another one. There's lots of of, of, you know, Yeah, home renovators, staging companies, et cetera, so many opportunities. I've got a price list of the average of those. And so the ones that you'd be just most shocked on is like utilities. It's the average household for utility. And I don't even have to hear. But I think if I remember off the top of my head in like the state of Texas is is $1,300. Well, you get a referral of that. They'll give you up to 30 or 40% referral on that. Think about that. I mean, you know, I mean, just like, yeah, people aren't paying about utilities. I mean, there's so many like you said solar. Oh my gosh. If, you know, if they have solar in your in your state, but it's it's being compliant. Right. It's the rest of the compliant ways and and how you build that. Yeah. It's, it's, it's, it's, it can be very, very, very, it's very, very lucrative. And attorneys have been doing this for years and years and years attorneys have referral relationships with other attorneys who are in different specialties. Obviously REALTORS do this. Oh, my clients moving to Florida and I live in Illinois. So I need to find someone in Florida. And I'm going to take X percentage of the commission by handing, you know, you an agent down there, the deal. And yes, you can do similar versions of this. And you, I love the thing you were saying to about this hyper locals that where you could go to businesses in your local market and say, look, I have, I have a following on online of people that, you know, no like and trust me. They listen to my suggestions. And I'm happy to sort of drive business to you, Mr. Mrs. Business owner. Would that be okay? Of course, the answer is going to be yes. And then, and then the question is great. Can we either work out a relationship where maybe, you know, I, maybe there's a revenue share like you were saying or maybe we can reciprocally send each other business. But I think, you know, business owners love this idea of, oh, you're going to help me grow my business. Awesome. Let's, and you know, they understand the nature of the recipe. The reciprocity of that. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And there's, yeah. And there's, so there's three ways that people can generate business that way. So I call it like one being an affiliate, right? Like we talked about like you could possibly get income to being. We call just a connect a connector like where you, you as the real estate professional look really good by being able to offer that higher level tier services on it. And you may get a discount yourself. And then three is like absolutely. You know, you're going to the, you become a professional. You are sharing a revenues or you might own or you do performance guarantees. You know, get some performance bonuses on stuff and, and you revenue share. So those are three different tiers. And I've got about four other tiers of way you can, ways you can, you can do that. Yeah. I mean, we're, and what are we talking about sort of bottom line on a transaction if a, and again, I, you know, numbers are going to vary wildly. But we're talking about possibly adding. A thousand or more dollars in rev in profit to even a transaction. Possibly possibly or more. Or more or more. Yes. Yes. I was being very conservative because I know, I know even what title gives us per deal here in Illinois. But which is, which is thousands. Right. That's also not titled. Yeah. Just on, yeah, just on just just a title mortgage. If you just think about, we talked about remember we said up to 41 different ways you can get paid on a transaction. Okay, let's just say you got paid on three more. Just just imagine you got just paid on those just three the basic, the basic core three. Let's just say it's mortgage handyman services or housekeeping services. I don't know. I mean, you know, you pick three. It's way more than you did before and it's doing the exact same. You're all right. You know, we all like it's funny. I, um, I have a, uh, how do we find our, our, the people that, you know, we hire to clean our homes on a regular basis. Well, yes, we could go online and try to find. But we usually ask our friends, right? We go, who's your cleaning person? Are they good? Yeah. Okay. They're not still. Yeah. Yeah. Right. Yeah. But those people are worth their weight in gold when you can find a good cleaning anyone, any vendor that's, that's excellent. We're like, oh my gosh. And, and, you know, people just freely sort of give out those referrals. And that's awesome. And you should do that. And you should also say, gosh, I want to help build your business. You are such an excellent vendor. I want to help you. And that's where you start is how can we help each other? And agents are just not used to asking that question. And this is the question. And, and fees going to help you not only identify all these opportunities and possibly becoming an equity partner in some of their businesses or some sort of, you know, affiliate or referral relationship, whatever. There's ways to do it. And whether you're getting paid, maybe you're getting paid in sweat equity. Maybe you're getting paid not in physical dollars, but services for your business that can, you know, maybe there's, by the way, accountants, those are pretty important people, right? So accountants is another opportunity. And I know they're on your list. Yeah. You've identified everyone. So this is exactly, guys, I think this is a perfect place for us to stop because if you haven't built some of these strategic partnerships and relationships to earn more than just a commission on a sale. And yes, that's, we understand that's how agents get paid. But there are other avenues. And fee is going to help you figure out how to do that. How to identify and how to approach those businesses and what to offer them and what to expect in return. And guys, it like fee was saying, you're already referring people to other vendors anyway. You might as well see if there's an opportunity to work together. And, you know, it's, you just, you've opened my eyes actually because I'm kind of a business owner myself. So I now have to start looking at our strategic partnerships and realize, oh, yeah, maybe I'm, I'm leaving some things on the table. In fact, I know I'm leaving. In fact, I'm going to ask feed. I'll take a look at my podcast and tell me how I'm leaving things on the table because I totally won a trillion percent and leaving money on the table. So I'm doing it guys. You're doing it. We're all doing it. So fee is here to save us all. So find for all things fee. Just find her on Instagram. She's, she's, she's, she's defined search fee gentry online.
