[00:04:21] So Chicago real estate at TTY dot com Donald, welcome to the show.
[00:04:26] Hey, thank you so much for having me. I appreciate the opportunity.
[00:04:29] Super excited to have you. I am. And I am very excited over the break to read Tao of the side hustle.
[00:04:36] And actually before we get into any of your story, I normally start with your story, but this because this book is so new and it's just crushing it in the Amazon charts.
[00:04:46] You know, and so that our audience doesn't have to wait 20 minutes for us to finally talk about the book. Tell us what the tell us what the book is who it's for and why you wrote it.
[00:04:55] So ultimately, if you look at if you look at America from a macro perspective, people hold wealth in three places. They hold their wealth in real estate, retirement plans and small businesses.
[00:05:09] So the biggest part problem with people when they're starting small businesses is that first step. So I wanted to create kind of a modern day art of war where we walk we guide the reader through a side hustle, you know, Tao the side hustle.
[00:05:26] So we go from side hustle to stabilize to scale, right. And it's basically a blend of Buddhism martial arts and business to help the reader, you know, start dipping their toe in entrepreneurship.
[00:05:39] Yeah, I love it. Who's best suited to for this book to make an impact on who needs to read this.
[00:05:47] You know, that's a good question. Like, you know, whenever you're creating a product for distribution, like you're only supposed to have an intended target audience, right.
[00:05:56] Historically, I would tell you people who have that entrepreneurial itch, right, that would be the historic answer.
[00:06:04] Today, I think that definition has brought in significantly.
[00:06:09] If you go all the way back to Adam Smith, wealth nation, some of the Adam Smith guy, right.
[00:06:14] Sure.
[00:06:15] You know, there's three ways to make money. There is salary. You have a job. There is profit. You have a business. And then there is rent. You have an appreciable property that you're able to, you know, collect passive income in some way, shape, performance.
[00:06:32] And so it's like one, two, three, right. Now, historically, I would tell you like, oh, those who with an entrepreneurial itch, right.
[00:06:39] Unfortunately, you know, the necessity is the mother of all innovation, right.
[00:06:45] Yeah.
[00:06:45] I have a feeling with given the economic climate that we're about to face, right.
[00:06:51] I think a lot of people are going to kind of be pushed into entrepreneurial positions, not out of desire, but out of necessity.
[00:07:01] Yeah, that makes, it makes a lot of sense. And I guess one fortunate part of that the sort of nature of the economy right now is technology has sort of enabled this global gig economy. And it's really, it brought in this, or expanded the ability of the average person to get involved and produce some of the side hustle services or products at a very minimal investment.
[00:07:28] And so, you know, the government in a lot of cases, you know, with the technology and infrastructure already built that does a lot of the heavy lifting.
[00:07:34] So it is kind of an exciting time to consider a side hustle because we just have a lot more resources now that that help make it a little bit easier.
[00:07:42] Yeah, the barrier entry to side hustle to have definitely changed like if you think about it, everybody has like a university of Google degree, like you can look up everything.
[00:07:51] There's two forms of knowledge. There's knowledge of and there's knowledge how knowledge of is where you're going to go when you learn about something right now, how is where you put in your 10,000 hours and kind of become a monster of something right now from an entrepreneur perspective, like being able to break into new areas and create new solutions for problems on like a micro local area is I don't think there's ever been a better time to do so.
[00:08:21] Yeah, I think you're right. And with especially with so many small businesses constantly being hit up for various services that maybe somebody with a side hustle can do more inexpensively can provide a real value locally as opposed to also doing it globally through places like Fiverr and these sort of gig services, you know, taskrabbit for people that are good with fixing and building.
[00:08:46] You know, it's funny. I was I had a guy from taskrabbit over who has a normal job, a full time job where he's like an engineer and does something with construction, but he's like a pretty decently high level guy in his salary.
[00:09:00] And he came over to swap out a door in our in our primary closet. And and it was a pretty difficult job. And I said, hey, just curious like why do you do this on the side.
[00:09:11] He goes, he goes, if I just did this, this gig stuff, I would actually make more than in my salary, but he's like, I just kind of like the stability of the of the things. So he's like, I'm just going to do this on the side. But I was like, man, this guy, you know, he's making right next to $3,000, $4,000 a month, just doing a couple of these gigs, you know, here and there outside of his normal business hours.
[00:09:33] Yeah, you know, that's ultimately the purpose of the side hustle, like not all businesses are meant to be scaled, right.
[00:09:41] So I I like to and I do like to invest in startups startups and side hustles. They're not the same.
[00:09:51] Right. A side hustle can become a startup, but a side hustle is not does not have the scalability sometimes as a startup. There are two different cultures, two different communities, right.
[00:10:02] The startup community, they're really looking to, you know, 10 X 20 X 50 X. And they're looking for an exit or liquidity event to, you know, for the business, right.
[00:10:12] Side hustle is something that like look man, like things are getting more expensive. Like, you know, it's funny talking about you, you're in real estate, you know, the Fed, today, if I may or may not raise the interest rate, I don't know if they're if they've done yet, but right there, there's two types of inflation. There is
[00:10:31] monetary inflation, there's two big money supply. And then their supply side inflation, like you're not going to be able to fix supply side inflation with increasing the interest rates. So I don't know if I necessarily agree with the way it's gone. Anyway, but there are those impacts are going to impact the way consumers deploy their capital right now.
[00:10:49] And I think there's going to be a huge liquidity event where all the money is sucked out of the system.
[00:10:56] That's interesting. Yeah, it is, it is interesting. I was also thinking to about the recent crypto exchanges or at least the biggest crypto exchange, which just went under FTX, which a lot of people have probably followed by the time this came out, who knows if
[00:11:12] Sam Bakeman for you, it'll actually be in prison in prison or who knows, but but and then there's other crypto exchanges, finances is possibly facing liquidity issues. And that's now the biggest exchange. And I'm just curious if if those if that exchange fails to I'm curious, a lot of that crypto money comes flooding back in and somehow gets, you know, reinvested by people in other ways and a side hustles a great way to invest money and actually, you know, make some income that's a little bit more hopefully predictable.
[00:11:41] But before before we get too far down that rabbit hole because I could talk about that all day, I would love to first hear your origin story like, how did you get involved in real estate? You were an athlete, you're now an author as well.
[00:11:55] You know, how did you get involved in law? You were an accountant, you're an accountant as well. You do a lot of different things. So it would love to hear about your trajectory. So walk us through that.
[00:12:05] So I was like, you know, Chicago Public School dude, like Lane Tech, Lane Tech guy, like I didn't have two nickels to rub together. So I kind of figured that, um, whenever you go to war, like let's say you and I were going to engage in combat in the end, when you break down a war or combat, there's these five things that you need to control, right?
[00:12:29] You know, you got to have a skill before you get into the other one. So let's start with skill. So I knew upfront, I had no money broke, didn't really have any connections or anything like that. So I had to become hyper focused and dominant in a skill.
[00:12:41] So I started with accounting because that was like the language of business, right?
[00:12:46] Sure.
[00:12:47] So I graduated in 2001 and immediately the N Ron collapse happened wiping out North or Anderson. I couldn't get a job.
[00:12:54] Sure. Right. So remember when that happened. Yes, absolutely.
[00:12:59] So, um, all the school guidance counselors, like after I've spent all this money and got like my accounting to grant CPA on another subject. So you should go back to, you know, go back to school, go to law school, right?
[00:13:09] So I went to law school, um, graduated in 2006 only to enter into the 2008 crash. Right.
[00:13:18] Perfect assignment.
[00:13:19] It was kind of at that point where I lost all confidence in like the guidance counselors and a lot of the teachers, because I found out most of those who were teaching me never actually worked before.
[00:13:29] So I said, OK, if I'm going to do this, I do really respect and appreciate like the skills that I learned, but I'm going to, I have, I have very little confidence in like the business training that these people gave me.
[00:13:39] So I, I basically started to eat more everybody and started to do tax returns, because I felt tax return to like a stable thing that everybody needed, right?
[00:13:47] Yeah, guaranteed, uh, at least, um, everyone least once a year has to, has to either do it themselves or hire someone. So it makes sense.
[00:13:55] So the tax return business started was, was amazing. It was like annual reoccurring revenue kept coming in.
[00:14:01] But then like, um, 2008 crash happens and I'm doing wonderful because everybody's still just notwithstanding like, uh, the complete collapse of like the financial system, people still needed to follow tax returns.
[00:14:13] And like, remember, when you're getting chased by a lion, when two gazelles are getting chased by a lion, you don't have to be the fastest gazelle in the world. You just got to be faster than the other person, right?
[00:14:23] So I, the firm that I was at most of the other attorneys just went belly on air and when that happened, I started gawding up the other practice areas, one of them being real estate, right? I had no idea what real estate was at the time, right?
[00:14:36] So, um, fortunately, I was able to land my first side hustle at that point in time, 2009.
[00:14:42] So, um, you know, with all my martial arts stuff, I was able to, you know, for I was lucky enough to participate in a major tournament where we shoot was a demo sport, the Olympics, I was able to make a medal, I'm not an official, I never claim to be, but I was on the US team.
[00:14:57] Um, this caught the attention of Warner Brothers, we're in 2009, they purchased an intellectual property out of bankruptcy called Mortal Kombat 9, right? And I was one of the guys that they came in to do the motion capture, right?
[00:15:09] First side hustle, all of a sudden, I started realizing, you know, the importance of making money, like having control of that, right?
[00:15:16] So, I'm kind of taking away, uh, doing tax returns and all of a sudden, the real estate market started to hockey stick, right?
[00:15:23] And I happened to be like forest garden with the shrimp boat captain. I wasn't so amazing, but I was just like one of the first guys who survived to participate in that market upswing, right?
[00:15:34] And I was never, my core competency was always tax law, but it never really had, but real estate happened just because I haven't been standing in the right place and it became a profit center.
[00:15:45] And today I'm a board member of the Eleanor Real Estate Law Association, I think I've done about 8,000 transactions, something like that.
[00:15:53] And it was kind of over time that I realized that, you know, value propositions, you know, they go from, they go through stages, like they go through a perceived through actual through evolving, you, they start with like you have to have a perceived value, like what he brings it to table, then you have to deliver actual value, which you do.
[00:16:12] And then you have to evolve this thing's change, right? As the market started to recover, I started to realize that real estate is such an important percentage of like the American families portfolio, right?
[00:16:25] And that's where I really started saying, okay, this real estate thing is very important because it's part of the overall like part of everyone's life. That's where I really got into it.
[00:16:37] Gotcha. And did you find that that real estate transactions were personally really fulfilling to you, like versus other types of law that you may have dabbled in?
[00:16:48] Well, what I would like about real estate transactions is, I believe in becoming fabric of the community, right?
[00:16:56] And like, and the way you truly become a fabric of community and you've got to shake the people's hands that you're serving, right?
[00:17:04] And the best way to kind of build that trust is like helping them establish a nest, right?
[00:17:09] So real estate kind of became one of our like lead generators where, you know, we would meet people to do their closing, it would transfer into like trusts in the States.
[00:17:19] And then we kind of just became there go to for everything.
[00:17:22] Yeah, imagine a state planning is like maybe the real estate transactions a nice entry point to then do the estate plan after the fact, does that happen a lot where a lot of your real estate clients be 100%.
[00:17:34] Like the thing is actually, I know this is blasphemous, right? But from from my perspective, I attorney CPA, I think we ought to offer a little bit of a broader value proposition.
[00:17:46] And right, I believe that real estate is a subsidiary of the state planning, right?
[00:17:52] Sure. I'm excited. I believe there's people who have this overall like a state plan and you do their closing kind of as part of that overall plan.
[00:18:00] I just don't know how you do a closing without knowing everybody's overall plan.
[00:18:04] We were just having this exact conversation with a real estate journalist yesterday, actually, or yeah, yesterday.
[00:18:11] And we were talking about how this is the year that REALTORS can really start to think of themselves more as a consultant where they actually try to take a broader, a broader view of the entire financial picture.
[00:18:25] And maybe that includes having conversations with the person's accountant with their attorney or with their financial advisor and really saying where does this home, if we're going to call this thing an asset, which is a debatable topic to a primary residence.
[00:18:40] I know it's an asset on the day it's sold, but is it an asset really between times? I don't know.
[00:18:46] But it's still an important piece of the financial picture, regardless of whether it's an asset or not.
[00:18:51] And it you're right. It's sort of like one of those things that, you know, when I go see a doctor, they make me fill out this massive checklist of like, what's wrong with you?
[00:19:00] What's your history? What's everything going on with your physical health entered, you know, exercise diet, et cetera, and all the stats.
[00:19:07] And your in your family history, because they need to be able to make a good recommendation and you're right.
[00:19:12] The sort of the real estate side of the, of someone's financial picture is often sort of isolated and segregated from everything else.
[00:19:22] And I imagine your, your sort of vision is to sort of integrate everything into looking at it all more holistically. Do I have that right?
[00:19:28] Yeah, well, I listen like in the end, my, my intent is the preservation of the American family.
[00:19:37] And the way you do that is by, you know, ultimately you need to make sure that they're safe, safety, and that they're secure, financially secure, right?
[00:19:47] And I don't, I believe I do continue to believe that home ownership and real estate investing is an important part of a diversified portfolio.
[00:19:56] I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss.

[00:21:14] And now back to our episode.
[00:21:17] Yeah, and do you do you look at primary residents diff I mean, obviously it's different from a revenue person or or a revenue perspective, right.
[00:21:26] So passive income residual income through investments. Obviously we understand there's tax benefits. There's there's obviously cash flow benefits.
[00:21:33] Do you look how do you encourage clients to think of their primary resident, is it an investment, is it an asset.
[00:21:42] And these are very debatable topics, but I think it's important because I think there's there are a lot of REALTORS that could really benefit from hearing some language from an attorney about how to how to have those conversations because personally I.
[00:21:56] I would love to look at my primary residence as an investment if it goes up, but I don't have much control over that that's not the reason I bought it as much as I would love for it to double in value probably won't, but, but it is a huge chunk of, you know, the money that I've had put into that home.
[00:22:12] So curious on on how you think about primary homes versus obviously versus you know buying, you know, a multi family and renting it out.
[00:22:20] Okay, so attorney CPA perspective, yeah, primary residence is an absolutely an asset. I strongly disagree with the argument that it's a liability.
[00:22:30] I respect and understand where the other, where the argument comes from, you know, the old school at age, like your primary residence is just a liability.
[00:22:40] I just, I think it's incorrect. I believe it's an asset, especially when you start looking at things generationally, right up.
[00:22:49] Like when you start looking at these generationally primary residence.
[00:22:53] And so I think it's, if it's like incurring an unrealized game to all the CPAs out there like we're building up the store of value, whereas if you're renting, you're not building that store of value.
[00:23:08] Now, it's always possible that you overextend.
[00:23:14] I'm a big fan of Albert Einstein and I love this little equation equal equals on square. So it equals MC square essentially means is energy equals mass times his people life square right the thing I love about that equation is it proves to us that energy and mass are equivalent because if you divide, see it's an algorithm, divide, see square by both sides.
[00:23:35] It shows that they can equal each other they become young right if they are relative to each other as money is a relative thing though that you make is only relative to the money you spend.
[00:23:49] So if you overspend relative, then yes, it becomes a liability right.
[00:23:56] Like if you don't do that and you're like normal, like it's an asset, especially anything that things generationally.
[00:24:03] Well, thank you for closing the door on that that I love that you shut the door with some authority on that particular argument whether primary residents and asset and you you explained it very, very well. I think that's important.
[00:24:18] And historically home prices over time generationally have historically risen right so we can look at historical data and say well, we can't, you know, obviously we can't project that your home is going to be worth more than it is today because that would be, you know, no one has the Oracle at Delphi to our crystal ball.
[00:24:36] But but we can assume based on historical data that it's likely that if trends continue that you may be here in 20, 30, 40 years, which in case does improve the quality of that asset from, you know, from a numbers perspective.
[00:24:51] So I am, I will tell you this, I am scared about 2023 now there's always opportunity when there's fear, but I think there's I'm speaking not so much for me because truthfully I'm not a practicing agent I have my license I don't use it I sit here at a desk all day and and try to recruit people to join our company.
[00:25:10] But we have about 700 agents here and they a lot of them are nervous and a lot of my friends outside of our company who are agents are nervous about 2023 why pretty obvious reasons, of course, everyone knows we have higher interest rate environment than we did two years ago, although I don't think it's that high, but it's certainly in comparison to the last few years it's still a big a bigger pill the swallow that it was double rates, you know, it was kind of where we're at low inventory and then dropping home prices.
[00:25:38] So curious on where's the opportunity in 2023 what should REALTORS be focused on and what as an attorney do you suggest that agents start to think about to really keep their business rolling next year so that it's not as bumpy as as maybe the news is suggesting it might be.
[00:25:58] Well it's going to be bumpy is definitely going to be bumpy it's just finding the opportunity within that bumpiness right like.
[00:26:05] From my perspective all ships floating high tides right you have when times are good everybody is like amazing like one of the things I tell people is I'm like an all terrain vehicle like I work in rain slate snow as I shine so many of these single silo like attorneys that's that's all they do like they don't work when times get when there's a.
[00:26:28] So from my perspective you have to kind of approach your business like that like are you prepared for the ups and the downs we're in a cyclical business so if you want to survive in a cyclical business you have to be able to work in both cycles right so from my perspective it's identifying the like the things that people are really going to need right.
[00:26:56] Let's start with the supply side there's a limited amount of inventory out there right I believe as you see the baby burn the silver tsunami coming you're going to see these guys they're going to have to redeploy their assets right.
[00:27:09] Huge amount of assets too I mean trillions of dollars are going to flood in.
[00:27:14] Yeah so 25 trillion is going to exchange hands right now the homes are a special asset right because like they need to figure out a way to either downsize if they're going to you know pass away or to long term living you know kids are all gone.
[00:27:30] And they're going to have to figure out to do it most of those homes don't have more edges on that right so they're not worried about trading from three to seven or three to six or whatever incident I have an on I have an ongoing.
[00:27:42] That with a couple of people of the date I think it's going to drop down to five you know off offline I'll enter to that with you right that way love that anyway what you know you're going to have a lot of the baby burn or population population that they have a bleeding neck and let me restate they don't have a bleeding that they have six shotguns pointed to the back of their head that they're going to have to figure out what to do with that land right now.
[00:28:09] You're going to have a motivated seller who's going to have to figure out what to do with that supply right right then let's talk about like purchasing right number one if the consumer doesn't come in and buy these assets right you're going to have foreign money flooding you know you're so much turbulence globalization I just were not a state bar I'm shocked I got picked up so quickly but it was like it's about the collapse of globalization I think you're going to see money start coming in here from other places.
[00:28:38] And you know listen all the house hacking is really cool but when you have a couple of kids good luck doing that you're going to have to buy your house to raise your family right your parents would you raise your kids in their basement right.
[00:28:51] So the supply side is going to be the baby boomers demand side is going to be foreign money and millennials who are being forced kind of to you know as their families expand right now there is a segment of the population that they're building up.
[00:29:06] So the velocity is going to decrease dramatically right and that percentage of the population they're trapped in two to three percent interest rates made on trade out right again right listen the pie is going to get smaller and really going to have to demonstrate and show everybody which your value proposition is from my perspective.
[00:29:24] This is really going to come down to who are real real estate people and who are marketers right a lot of people in sales that their rates salesman right sure if you would go back 23 years into the real estate market before people the sales thing like the top of the funnel you know everybody came great marketers right.
[00:29:44] Real estate was a pool business what a pool business means is you get pulled into transaction you have a special skill that gets you pulled in right you guys were never intended to be in a push business it became a push business because your commissions are so lucrative that it pushed into marketing people right.
[00:29:58] But this is going to force the vendors to become hyper specialized in what they do they really got to know what they're doing and the consumer has got so got named smart right that if you don't know what they're doing you're doing they're going to know really quick yeah.
[00:30:15] So you really got to get back down to that core of like man you know what you're doing right so this is the year to really hone those are sharp in those sticks those steps.
[00:30:28] They're going to get a skill set sticks or tools in the arsenal to know more than you know the average consumer who once a month checks their estimate and see what their home values worth which of course they don't need you to do because they can just pull that up no whether that numbers accurate and not is is irrelevant but that's what they're going to do so you need to be able to bring value in between transactions right so person what buys and sells every what seven years or whatever the status so here's a great question.
[00:30:58] I'm sorry I don't know if it's a great question I shouldn't say my own questions are great but here's a question that I think would be of great value to our audience which is and you're not you're not a practicing broker but you work with REALTORS and you work with homeowners not a fraction.
[00:31:13] You do everything else but the broker is very important to me I like listen you know I'm and it's very hard to break this shell right but I will be vulnerable to tell you.
[00:31:28] The importance of the broker right and I want my perspective my sole agenda is the preservation of the American wealth ecosystem for a family right and most people have less than a thousand dollars in their bank account like 80s like I think it's like 78 or 80% something like that have less than 1000 dollars that is that is horribly depressing and unfortunately true so many people land do you do you want to do that.
[00:31:58] Read all these articles. JP Morgan bought a billion dollars in my hand you know this read bought a billion dollars blackstone but 50 billion you know why they do that.
[00:32:08] You know I actually don't know why they do because it's a good idea it works.
[00:32:13] Yes.
[00:32:14] That church does a similar thing too they buy a lot of land.
[00:32:17] You've been proved if you buy it I'll be a more aggressive you're dancing and you're saying oh like you know it might not go it's going to go up it's a store of value right.
[00:32:28] I I used to have a I had a friend who was an attorney who's worked for the Catholic church and her job no joke in in the US and I'm sure they have these positions all over the world was to buy land where they could put schools Catholic schools Catholic.
[00:32:43] Education which courses its own business and a huge business but the big thing was not we want to we don't want to rent space we want to buy the land put the school on it and it's part and this is this is her full time job just finding land for schools.
[00:33:00] So the reason why they do that is because it works so really good idea right.
[00:33:06] Like especially American dirt American dirt American breaking orders amazing right.
[00:33:13] Like this morning what are the important things that you've done and I asked you what did you do when you first I went to the gym I'd say that's for me that's probably the most important thing I did.
[00:33:23] What did you do after you went to the gym.
[00:33:25] I came back started started thinking about recruiting more REALTORS.
[00:33:32] I took a shower this morning yes.
[00:33:35] Okay so what do you need to take shower.
[00:33:38] What do I why did I take a shower what do I need.
[00:33:40] You need to take a shower so you need water and electricity well you don't need electricity but I use electricity.
[00:33:45] You need water right so we live in one of the biggest areas of fresh water so before I was you know I worked at a lot of firm called yield.
[00:33:55] It's like number three in all of Asia and soul South Korea right I thought I was a big shot right anyway I met this big big shot law firm right and I go to get my place my little studio right and I find out how expensive those I think whoa that's how much it costs for this like studio that's crazy.
[00:34:13] It turns out if you sold South Korea you could buy France eight times that's how expensive the land is right.
[00:34:19] It's one of the cool interesting things about South Korea we got a river that goes right through the soul and stuff like that.
[00:34:25] 
[00:34:25] Toronto by ocean right and you can't drink ocean water or bay than it right so all of a sudden water becomes scarcity.
[00:34:32] So like for someone like me I recognize like the relevant the relative importance of water right where people here you know you take an hour long shower and when you cares right which is in the world like it becomes a really good deal.
[00:34:47] So I guess what I'm trying to say is like we ultimately the land that you purchase needs to have a value a reason why people like it right our soil is very abundant in natural resources which allows you to have an incoherence on growth right and we have water.
[00:35:03] So like you know so long as the resource resources remain consistent like in theory as long as the value of commodity goes up so low the value of the land relative to the value of commodity right sure really it's a good investment as well people come along the stuff.
[00:35:23] Yeah it makes it makes perfect perfect sense so REALTOR's right now are thinking okay I've got a lot of my clientele refinanced or purchased in the last couple of years when the interest rates were low and obviously a lot didn't but the ones that did you know I what do I first of all do we say anything to the person who's at a 3% rate right now.
[00:35:49] Who is feeling like I can't move because if I move I'm going to a 6.5% rate what are what are we saying to those what do you suggest we say to those people if anything at all right now.
[00:36:04] So do you have your handy dandy computer there I do.
[00:36:08] And you look at JP Morgan Chase buys a billion dollar of single family homes.
[00:36:15] Yeah looking it up right now.
[00:36:21] Yeah here's got it.
[00:36:23] Yeah single family rentals a billion dollars earlier this November yeah.
[00:36:28] What date is that.
[00:36:31] So the news articles November 16th.
[00:36:34] Okay would you agree November 16th that's like a month ago right like the rate for in the 6th is a 7th.
[00:36:41] Yeah.
[00:36:41] You want to know why they're buying that they're doing that I want to know why Jamie diamond does anything so yes tell me.
[00:36:48] It's a really good idea because he's a really smart guy.
[00:36:52] They saw the interest rates go up and they eliminated all the competition.
[00:36:58] Yeah.
[00:36:59] I interest rates went out they eliminated the competition they go in and acquire do the acquisition so like the first of all.
[00:37:09] I do think the mortgage interest rates are going to go down right let me open with that right so with that said.
[00:37:17] I do believe that it is probably not a smart idea to wait until they go down to buy.
[00:37:28] Because the second they go down you're going to have this huge award of competition coming out they're going to bid up the prices again.
[00:37:34] Which is what happened when in 3% rates same exact things happen.
[00:37:38] 100% like what you want to do is you want to try to go in there where there's.
[00:37:42] And that's the cost of money that I'm going to put out my old to medium competition exactly when JPMORI Chase is doing to you.
[00:37:47] It's hilarious right you're own big price to you out and that is my own bank that's funny yeah your own bank price to you also they can buy your land it's hilarious right.
[00:37:56] It really got to be conscious of when that rate goes down,
[00:38:02] everybody's gonna flint in.
[00:38:04] Now, you gotta make that decision,
[00:38:05] but if I were to broke,
[00:38:06] if I was in your business, right,
[00:38:08] this is a dialogue that I would be having with my people.
[00:38:12] Hey, forget about the industry.
[00:38:14] Put that to the side for a second.
[00:38:15] Tell me about your needs.
[00:38:17] Are you in a one-bedroom condo with one kid
[00:38:20] and you're about to have a second kid?
[00:38:22] 
[00:38:23] You're saying it can work, right?
[00:38:25] Let's go find you something that's within your budget
[00:38:28] that meets the needs of your family.
[00:38:30] Hey, are you, is your parent 65?
[00:38:34] How are they doing?
[00:38:35] Do you think that they're gonna be in a nursing home?
[00:38:38] Do they have long-term coverage?
[00:38:39] If they don't, like you need to have these things
[00:38:42] in mind for them, right?
[00:38:44] Can we just do a public service announcement and break
[00:38:46] for just a moment?
[00:38:47] Can we talk about long-term care?
[00:38:48] And not get into the weeds about it,
[00:38:50] but I know you beat, you've been beat,
[00:38:52] you beat the drum on long-term care insurance,
[00:38:54] and I'm so grateful for you to do this
[00:38:56] because there are so many people.
[00:38:58] So everyone listening, if your parents are elderly,
[00:39:02] can you just give the quick little 30 second
[00:39:04] on why everybody's parents need to have long-term care?
[00:39:08] Okay, so most people don't have long-term care.
[00:39:11] Which is insane.
[00:39:13] Well, what long-term care means is,
[00:39:17] if your parents are unable to function on their own,
[00:39:20] and they have to go like they get to mention,
[00:39:22] they gotta go to the assisted living in nursing home
[00:39:23] or something like that,
[00:39:25] those places are really expensive, right?
[00:39:28] So you need to have insurance policy
[00:39:30] to cover the cost of that.
[00:39:32] Now, assuming that you don't have that,
[00:39:34] because most of you will have it, right?
[00:39:36] The only way to afford that is,
[00:39:38] let's say they get a pension of 4,000, right?
[00:39:42] And let's say you find them in nursing home, that's 6,000.
[00:39:45] The nursing home will allow them to come in,
[00:39:48] take the 4,000 a month, right?
[00:39:52] And the gap, the delta,
[00:39:54] they will normally get covered under Medicaid through Illinois.
[00:39:58] Now, Medicaid is provided by the state,
[00:40:02] but funded by the facts, right?
[00:40:04] Now, the catch of getting that free Medicaid
[00:40:09] is if your parents own a house free and clear,
[00:40:12] which most baby will understand, they paid it off, right?
[00:40:15] The state can turn around and attach a lien against the equity
[00:40:20] with a five-year look back.
[00:40:22] They can go back five years to any money
[00:40:25] that they paid on your parents behalf to live there, right?
[00:40:28] So they can essentially lose the asset that they were,
[00:40:31] that they've built.
[00:40:33] So if anybody's out there thinking generation,
[00:40:35] well, we gotta have that in the back of your head.
[00:40:37] Yeah, just ask your parents
[00:40:39] if they have long-term care insurance,
[00:40:40] talk to a financial advisor, get that done,
[00:40:43] because I don't even remember what the average cost is
[00:40:46] for facility care these days,
[00:40:48] but I wanna say for a year, it's $10,000?
[00:40:51] Yeah, it's a lot.
[00:40:52] It's tens and tens of thousands of dollars.
[00:40:55] Okay, anyway, back to our regularly scheduled program,
[00:40:59] but this really ties in long-term care,
[00:41:01] because you were talking about generational wealth
[00:41:03] and nothing wipes out generational wealth faster
[00:41:05] than managed care for elderly people.
[00:41:09] So I'm glad we were able to do our public service announcement
[00:41:13] of the year, but let's talk about, okay.
[00:41:16] So back to being a REALTOR.
[00:41:19] So I'm thinking about our audience, we're REALTORS,
[00:41:23] we're worried about 2023, interest rates are up,
[00:41:26] which means the average consumer thinks
[00:41:28] they're not getting a deal right now, right?
[00:41:31] They're not getting a deal.
[00:41:32] You said, don't wait for it to try,
[00:41:34] don't try to time the market,
[00:41:36] don't wait for the interest rates to come down.
[00:41:38] Why not?
[00:41:39] Because when they do come down, what's gonna happen is
[00:41:42] every single person who's waiting on the sidelines,
[00:41:45] they're gonna jump in all at the same time.
[00:41:48] Like if I was a REALTOR, so here,
[00:41:50] let's talk damage control of your REALTOR.
[00:41:52] You got to right size your business right now.
[00:41:54] If you believe that your top line revenue
[00:41:58] is gonna decrease 20%, you got to go line on by line on them
[00:42:02] and you got to decrease your expenses 20%, real simple.
[00:42:05] Okay, right size your company.
[00:42:07] If you're caring too much fat right now,
[00:42:08] it's time to carve a fat out, right?
[00:42:11] So that's step one, do that first.
[00:42:13] That's something you should be doing right now, right?
[00:42:16] Step two, once you've right size your company,
[00:42:19] I would turn my attention to just educating your client
[00:42:23] on like real, real list, no,
[00:42:27] I would turn to listening to your client
[00:42:28] on what their needs are.
[00:42:30] If you know that they're gonna have a need to like,
[00:42:34] you know, move, then step three,
[00:42:38] talk to them about the difference between the interest rate
[00:42:40] and like competition because
[00:42:42] when the competition comes flooding in, dude,
[00:42:45] I think it's gonna be a big wave.
[00:42:48] People get priced out.
[00:42:49] Yeah, it's, let's all remember what happened
[00:42:52] with the sub four percent rates in the last couple of years.
[00:42:58] Remember, you know, if we had listings,
[00:43:00] it was Feast or Famine, right?
[00:43:01] If you had listings, you were feasting
[00:43:03] and if you were working with buyers,
[00:43:05] whoop, it was tough.
[00:43:07] You were submitting offers site unseen,
[00:43:09] you were getting, you know, 30 plus offers
[00:43:11] and trying to get yours noticed.
[00:43:13] And it is, remember how hard that was
[00:43:16] to sort of thread that perfect needle,
[00:43:19] you know, it was difficult back then.
[00:43:21] So I think you're bringing up a good point.
[00:43:23] And maybe if looking at the math,
[00:43:26] maybe the metrics are such that you would have overpaid
[00:43:30] two years ago, despite the fact
[00:43:32] that you were in a lower interest rate environment.
[00:43:33] And maybe now, even though higher interest rates
[00:43:35] lower pricing, maybe it actually evens out
[00:43:38] more than the consumer might think.
[00:43:41] 100%. Yeah.
[00:43:42] If you get a, if you get a lower, lower,
[00:43:44] my father paid for his house, he paid $55,000 for his house,
[00:43:47] but it was like a 10% interest rate.
[00:43:49] So it's not a lot, right?
[00:43:51] So if you get a discount on the retail price,
[00:43:53] it oftentimes it is of equaling out, right?
[00:43:56] But the one thing I will say to everybody is,
[00:43:59] let's be honest guys, the last two years
[00:44:02] was probably the greatest rush of real estate velocity
[00:44:05] and we'll probably never see that again, right?
[00:44:08] The rates are never gonna get that low.
[00:44:11] You're never gonna see that again, right?
[00:44:13] Right now you gotta turn your attention
[00:44:15] to right sizing your operations
[00:44:16] and providing that value to the consumer.
[00:44:19] And the consumer is hyper-ridical right now.
[00:44:22] And like you said at the very beginning,
[00:44:24] they have access to everything.
[00:44:26] Now, so, you know, we all have access to everything.
[00:44:29] It's in our pockets that we walk around with, you know,
[00:44:32] this basically magical device that tells us
[00:44:34] anything we wanna know at any time for free essentially.
[00:44:38] And so as an agent, so a couple of things
[00:44:41] I got from what you were saying.
[00:44:43] Number one, a lot of agents are going to be exiting the business
[00:44:46] who work true, full all in agents.
[00:44:49] The part-timers, the onesy-toosies,
[00:44:52] they're going to start to slowly exit the business
[00:44:55] or just become less relevant.
[00:44:57] So we're probably gonna see some sort of exodus for agents,
[00:45:01] which is a great thing for agents that are looking
[00:45:03] to scale up and grow their business.
[00:45:04] Because there is gonna be less competition.
[00:45:06] A lot of the maybe poor quality agents will be leaving the industry.
[00:45:11] The stronger agents, the really savvy value added agents
[00:45:17] will continue to thrive.
[00:45:19] But in order to get there, you have to do the heavy lifting,
[00:45:21] which is what you were talking about
[00:45:23] is sharpening the tools.
[00:45:24] This is the year 2023 where you really want to be better.
[00:45:30] What do you recommend for agents to study?
[00:45:34] As far as like a daily practice,
[00:45:36] and again, I know you're not a practicing agent per se,
[00:45:39] but what do you wish agents knew from an attorney's perspective?
[00:45:44] What do you wish agents were better at?
[00:45:47] I always believe in marketing, like how you consume, right?
[00:45:53] Like you should market to people where you consume
[00:45:55] as a consumer, right?
[00:45:58] You know, I was like as a consumer, right?
[00:46:03] My family, when we first got here from Korea,
[00:46:05] we got heavily involved in real estate
[00:46:07] because we were in the restaurant business.
[00:46:10] We sold, we were number one in the state
[00:46:13] and used restaurant market.
[00:46:16] We had like 200,000 square feet of like restaurants stuff, right?
[00:46:21] So we would, we needed to buy big locations
[00:46:23] to house the equipment, right?
[00:46:25] And one of the things that I think we found important
[00:46:28] from people is like you really have to know the assets
[00:46:33] that you're selling, you're helping someone buy, right?
[00:46:37] The thing, if you're in the condom business, right?
[00:46:41] Did you really got to know that HLA
[00:46:43] before you get your environment, right?
[00:46:45] If you don't have, if you have no idea
[00:46:48] of the financial health of that HLA,
[00:46:50] like if you're just hoping that the attorney catches it
[00:46:53] from the 22.1, like that's what you're doing.
[00:46:56] That's crazy to me.
[00:46:57] Like you really got to know these things here.
[00:47:00] I'll give you an example from an attorney's perspective.
[00:47:02] In 16 years, I've probably done 8,000 transactions.
[00:47:07] Whenever I catch something on the 22.1, right?
[00:47:12] The 22.1 is a financial snapshot
[00:47:13] which shows capital upcoming unexpected
[00:47:16] or expected capital expenditures.
[00:47:18] Whenever I catch something and I tell the buyer,
[00:47:20] this is what immediately happens.
[00:47:23] I press send on the email, send.
[00:47:27] But it ain't, hey, Dad, thanks for catching that thing.
[00:47:32] Why in the hell did my REALTOR not tell me about that?
[00:47:35] Yeah.
[00:47:36] Right, 100 out of 100 doesn't happen, right?
[00:47:40] Like if you're going to go into a building,
[00:47:41] you've got to know what's going on with the building, right?
[00:47:44] So that's if you're in the condom business.
[00:47:46] If you're in like the single family home business,
[00:47:49] you got to kind of have some sort of idea
[00:47:52] of the neighborhood you're putting people in, right?
[00:47:55] You gotta say like, I know there's restrictions
[00:47:58] on what you can disclose, right?
[00:48:00] But you gotta talk to your client
[00:48:03] and let them understand like, hey,
[00:48:07] this is wonderful school systems,
[00:48:11] communities and this and that.
[00:48:12] And they gotta know what's going on.
[00:48:14] Like for me personally, whenever I do like investing,
[00:48:17] I like when I invest in, let's take single family homes,
[00:48:20] for example, I believe that you have to control one
[00:48:24] of three things to be a real estate investor.
[00:48:26] You gotta control the dirt, the tenant with money,
[00:48:28] one of those straight, dirt tenant money.
[00:48:30] So I like tenant control.
[00:48:31] Tenant control is the coolest to me, right?
[00:48:34] So what I like to do is I like to buy single family homes
[00:48:36] in the best school districts.
[00:48:38] And I am the cheapest rent in the best school districts.
[00:48:42] That's my model, right?
[00:48:44] I love that.
[00:48:45] That's what every parent, not every parent,
[00:48:47] but what parents want to live in the school districts,
[00:48:50] not every parent in the best school district,
[00:48:52] not every parent can afford that.
[00:48:53] So you want to make the affordable option
[00:48:55] for people to enter that education space.
[00:48:58] 
[00:48:58] 100% 100% I want to be the most affordable
[00:49:00] in the best school district.
[00:49:01] That's my value proposition.
[00:49:02] That's the product that I offer, right?
[00:49:06] Now like to me, like I really know
[00:49:11] what the product that I'm buying, right?
[00:49:14] Like surgery, right?
[00:49:16] And it can be like when you're a broker,
[00:49:24] the customer sees that you're walking away
[00:49:27] with a big commission check, right?
[00:49:29] And they see the inspector getting paid six-fair bucks.
[00:49:32] They see the attorney get paid six, 700 bucks, right?
[00:49:36] If like the inspection I get,
[00:49:38] if there's something that you couldn't have found,
[00:49:40] totally get it, right?
[00:49:42] But if they find out that there's an atomic bomb there,
[00:49:47] right?
[00:49:49] 999 times out of a thousand, they're mad at me.
[00:49:52] They call me and they're like, dude, what the hell happened?
[00:49:54] How come people would know about this, right?
[00:49:57] There's an outcome, there's, of course,
[00:49:58] we got a great deal.
[00:49:59] There's a $70,000 special assessment coming up.
[00:50:02] Sure.
[00:50:03] Right?
[00:50:04] You know what I mean?
[00:50:05] Yeah.
[00:50:06] Of course we got a great deal.
[00:50:07] This is going to be a deconversion, right?
[00:50:11] Like, you know, stuff like that.
[00:50:14] So realizing that REALTORS are highly compensated
[00:50:20] for the transaction and not taking that responsibility lightly
[00:50:25] and really providing over-providing value
[00:50:30] or providing more value than would be expected
[00:50:32] so that the consumer never calls the attorney
[00:50:35] who got paid the six or $700
[00:50:38] and goes, how come you caught this in my agent
[00:50:40] who just got 10 grand, didn't catch it?
[00:50:42] Like, I actually think, you know, given like your,
[00:50:45] your role in the transaction, top of the funnel,
[00:50:49] defending value, I don't think you're unfairly compensated,
[00:50:53] right?
[00:50:54] But I don't think it's an unfair compensation,
[00:50:57] but you have to, like, if you don't know the product
[00:51:02] that you're selling, like really know it
[00:51:05] and the client finds out that you're highly compensated
[00:51:08] and you don't know what you're selling, they give them.
[00:51:12] Yeah, I've had this fantasy in, and I don't know,
[00:51:17] it probably will never come true,
[00:51:18] but I want, I would love real estate to move away
[00:51:21] from, for REALTORS how they're compensated,
[00:51:24] to move away from transaction, to work to more sort of,
[00:51:28] like a financial advisory model where it's,
[00:51:31] you know, assets under management, fee-based model,
[00:51:33] you know, you get a percentage.
[00:51:34] I don't know if it'll ever happen.
[00:51:36] I don't know if it's possible, but boy,
[00:51:37] that would really change the game, I think.
[00:51:41] I don't know if the, I actually, you know,
[00:51:44] I respect the counter-argument,
[00:51:46] but I actually think with the,
[00:51:49] I don't think they're unfairly compensated, right?
[00:51:52] I think what they do is legit, and here's why,
[00:51:56] ultimately, their job is to defend the value.
[00:51:59] Yeah.
[00:52:00] That's ultimately their job, right, to defend value.
[00:52:05] And if you defend the value, it's worth it, right?
[00:52:10] You know, it's worth it.
[00:52:11] It's worth it.
[00:52:12] But if you don't defend the value,
[00:52:14] then it really becomes a problem, right?
[00:52:17] And that's the thing you really are gonna have to know.
[00:52:22] Like, I recently, I did a wholesale deal
[00:52:27] where, you know, they flipped the contract,
[00:52:29] and it was a big number.
[00:52:31] Right.
[00:52:32] Huge number.
[00:52:34] The sellers got so angry at the listing.
[00:52:38] They'd have to, of course.
[00:52:40] They were like, how the hell did you get this number wrong, right?
[00:52:44] I'm sorry about that.
[00:52:45] They were like, how the hell did you get this number wrong?
[00:52:47] Right?
[00:52:48] Your entire reason you're here is to value that, right?
[00:52:52] So like, if you stand by that,
[00:52:55] like, it makes sense because it's,
[00:52:58] that is the most important thing,
[00:53:00] which is the value at all, right?
[00:53:02] 
[00:53:02] So I actually think the number is fair,
[00:53:06] but you really have to know that.
[00:53:08] You just can't be a guy or gal who switched careers.
[00:53:12] You're really good at marketing,
[00:53:13] has a great network.
[00:53:15] Don't know the product and sells it.
[00:53:17] That's what is gonna get a little scary.
[00:53:20] Yeah.
[00:53:20] So sharpen your tools, learn the inventory,
[00:53:23] learn the market, learn what to look for.
[00:53:27] You know, with respect to closings,
[00:53:29] especially condo, you were saying HOA stuff.
[00:53:31] Yeah, boy, because all of us, you know, consumers,
[00:53:35] when we're buying something,
[00:53:38] I, as long as I've been in this industry,
[00:53:41] I've always thought,
[00:53:42] because I'm not a practicing agent,
[00:53:44] I always thought, doesn't everybody just wanna know,
[00:53:46] is this a good idea?
[00:53:48] That's really kind of what we all want.
[00:53:50] Like, should I buy that?
[00:53:51] Should I not buy that?
[00:53:52] And I really think REALTORS say, I'll help you buy that.
[00:53:56] But I really, what I want a REALTOR to do is say,
[00:53:59] you should buy that or you shouldn't.
[00:54:01] And in order to make that distinction or that recommendation,
[00:54:05] you really do have to have some pretty sharp tools
[00:54:08] in your, or sharp arrows in your quiver.
[00:54:11] But this is the year to develop that,
[00:54:13] because if you can become the person that gives it vice,
[00:54:17] and again, depending on what state you live in,
[00:54:19] you have to obviously, you wanna be compliant,
[00:54:21] make sure you're not running a foul of compliance rules.
[00:54:24] But whatever is allowed,
[00:54:26] I think the real value is in the advice.
[00:54:30] Obviously pricing advice, should I buy this, should I sell this,
[00:54:32] well, how should I do it?
[00:54:34] I just, I love having people giving me advice in my life,
[00:54:39] my service providers.
[00:54:39] That's really what I want for my account
[00:54:41] and my attorney, my financial advisor, my trainer.
[00:54:43] I want them telling me, you should do this.
[00:54:46] Mm-hmm, 100%.
[00:54:47] I think that's the direction everything's gonna go.
[00:54:50] And I think if you do that,
[00:54:52] market goes up, market goes down.
[00:54:54] There will always be people who need help.
[00:54:57] And if they know that you could help them,
[00:54:59] and whether it's an upper-down market
[00:55:01] that you can help, you're gonna be fine.
[00:55:03] Well, I could talk to Don all day to, all day.
[00:55:07] And we certainly would love to have him back
[00:55:09] on future episodes.
[00:55:10] But for now, we're going to encourage every single person
[00:55:14] who is listening or watching right now,

You can visit his real estate website at Chicago real estate at TTY. So Chicago real estate at TTY dot com Donald, welcome to the show. Hey, thank you so much for having me. I appreciate the opportunity. Super excited to have you. I am. And I am very excited over the break to read Tao of the side hustle. And actually before we get into any of your story, I normally start with your story, but this because this book is so new and it's just crushing it in the Amazon charts. You know, and so that our audience doesn't have to wait 20 minutes for us to finally talk about the book. Tell us what the tell us what the book is who it's for and why you wrote it. So ultimately, if you look at if you look at America from a macro perspective, people hold wealth in three places. They hold their wealth in real estate, retirement plans and small businesses. So the biggest part problem with people when they're starting small businesses is that first step. So I wanted to create kind of a modern day art of war where we walk we guide the reader through a side hustle, you know, Tao the side hustle. So we go from side hustle to stabilize to scale, right. And it's basically a blend of Buddhism martial arts and business to help the reader, you know, start dipping their toe in entrepreneurship. Yeah, I love it. Who's best suited to for this book to make an impact on who needs to read this. You know, that's a good question. Like, you know, whenever you're creating a product for distribution, like you're only supposed to have an intended target audience, right. Historically, I would tell you people who have that entrepreneurial itch, right, that would be the historic answer. Today, I think that definition has brought in significantly. If you go all the way back to Adam Smith, wealth nation, some of the Adam Smith guy, right. Sure. You know, there's three ways to make money. There is salary. You have a job. There is profit. You have a business. And then there is rent. You have an appreciable property that you're able to, you know, collect passive income in some way, shape, performance. And so it's like one, two, three, right. Now, historically, I would tell you like, oh, those who with an entrepreneurial itch, right. Unfortunately, you know, the necessity is the mother of all innovation, right. Yeah. I have a feeling with given the economic climate that we're about to face, right. I think a lot of people are going to kind of be pushed into entrepreneurial positions, not out of desire, but out of necessity. Yeah, that makes, it makes a lot of sense. And I guess one fortunate part of that the sort of nature of the economy right now is technology has sort of enabled this global gig economy. And it's really, it brought in this, or expanded the ability of the average person to get involved and produce some of the side hustle services or products at a very minimal investment. And so, you know, the government in a lot of cases, you know, with the technology and infrastructure already built that does a lot of the heavy lifting. So it is kind of an exciting time to consider a side hustle because we just have a lot more resources now that that help make it a little bit easier. Yeah, the barrier entry to side hustle to have definitely changed like if you think about it, everybody has like a university of Google degree, like you can look up everything. There's two forms of knowledge. There's knowledge of and there's knowledge how knowledge of is where you're going to go when you learn about something right now, how is where you put in your 10,000 hours and kind of become a monster of something right now from an entrepreneur perspective, like being able to break into new areas and create new solutions for problems on like a micro local area is I don't think there's ever been a better time to do so. Yeah, I think you're right. And with especially with so many small businesses constantly being hit up for various services that maybe somebody with a side hustle can do more inexpensively can provide a real value locally as opposed to also doing it globally through places like Fiverr and these sort of gig services, you know, taskrabbit for people that are good with fixing and building. You know, it's funny. I was I had a guy from taskrabbit over who has a normal job, a full time job where he's like an engineer and does something with construction, but he's like a pretty decently high level guy in his salary. And he came over to swap out a door in our in our primary closet. And and it was a pretty difficult job. And I said, hey, just curious like why do you do this on the side. He goes, he goes, if I just did this, this gig stuff, I would actually make more than in my salary, but he's like, I just kind of like the stability of the of the things. So he's like, I'm just going to do this on the side. But I was like, man, this guy, you know, he's making right next to $3,000, $4,000 a month, just doing a couple of these gigs, you know, here and there outside of his normal business hours. Yeah, you know, that's ultimately the purpose of the side hustle, like not all businesses are meant to be scaled, right. So I I like to and I do like to invest in startups startups and side hustles. They're not the same. Right. A side hustle can become a startup, but a side hustle is not does not have the scalability sometimes as a startup. There are two different cultures, two different communities, right. The startup community, they're really looking to, you know, 10 X 20 X 50 X. And they're looking for an exit or liquidity event to, you know, for the business, right. Side hustle is something that like look man, like things are getting more expensive. Like, you know, it's funny talking about you, you're in real estate, you know, the Fed, today, if I may or may not raise the interest rate, I don't know if they're if they've done yet, but right there, there's two types of inflation. There is monetary inflation, there's two big money supply. And then their supply side inflation, like you're not going to be able to fix supply side inflation with increasing the interest rates. So I don't know if I necessarily agree with the way it's gone. Anyway, but there are those impacts are going to impact the way consumers deploy their capital right now. And I think there's going to be a huge liquidity event where all the money is sucked out of the system. That's interesting. Yeah, it is, it is interesting. I was also thinking to about the recent crypto exchanges or at least the biggest crypto exchange, which just went under FTX, which a lot of people have probably followed by the time this came out, who knows if Sam Bakeman for you, it'll actually be in prison in prison or who knows, but but and then there's other crypto exchanges, finances is possibly facing liquidity issues. And that's now the biggest exchange. And I'm just curious if if those if that exchange fails to I'm curious, a lot of that crypto money comes flooding back in and somehow gets, you know, reinvested by people in other ways and a side hustles a great way to invest money and actually, you know, make some income that's a little bit more hopefully predictable. But before before we get too far down that rabbit hole because I could talk about that all day, I would love to first hear your origin story like, how did you get involved in real estate? You were an athlete, you're now an author as well. You know, how did you get involved in law? You were an accountant, you're an accountant as well. You do a lot of different things. So it would love to hear about your trajectory. So walk us through that. So I was like, you know, Chicago Public School dude, like Lane Tech, Lane Tech guy, like I didn't have two nickels to rub together. So I kind of figured that, um, whenever you go to war, like let's say you and I were going to engage in combat in the end, when you break down a war or combat, there's these five things that you need to control, right? You know, you got to have a skill before you get into the other one. So let's start with skill. So I knew upfront, I had no money broke, didn't really have any connections or anything like that. So I had to become hyper focused and dominant in a skill. So I started with accounting because that was like the language of business, right? Sure. So I graduated in 2001 and immediately the N Ron collapse happened wiping out North or Anderson. I couldn't get a job. Sure. Right. So remember when that happened. Yes, absolutely. So, um, all the school guidance counselors, like after I've spent all this money and got like my accounting to grant CPA on another subject. So you should go back to, you know, go back to school, go to law school, right? So I went to law school, um, graduated in 2006 only to enter into the 2008 crash. Right. Perfect assignment. It was kind of at that point where I lost all confidence in like the guidance counselors and a lot of the teachers, because I found out most of those who were teaching me never actually worked before. So I said, OK, if I'm going to do this, I do really respect and appreciate like the skills that I learned, but I'm going to, I have, I have very little confidence in like the business training that these people gave me. So I, I basically started to eat more everybody and started to do tax returns, because I felt tax return to like a stable thing that everybody needed, right? Yeah, guaranteed, uh, at least, um, everyone least once a year has to, has to either do it themselves or hire someone. So it makes sense. So the tax return business started was, was amazing. It was like annual reoccurring revenue kept coming in. But then like, um, 2008 crash happens and I'm doing wonderful because everybody's still just notwithstanding like, uh, the complete collapse of like the financial system, people still needed to follow tax returns. And like, remember, when you're getting chased by a lion, when two gazelles are getting chased by a lion, you don't have to be the fastest gazelle in the world. You just got to be faster than the other person, right? So I, the firm that I was at most of the other attorneys just went belly on air and when that happened, I started gawding up the other practice areas, one of them being real estate, right? I had no idea what real estate was at the time, right? So, um, fortunately, I was able to land my first side hustle at that point in time, 2009. So, um, you know, with all my martial arts stuff, I was able to, you know, for I was lucky enough to participate in a major tournament where we shoot was a demo sport, the Olympics, I was able to make a medal, I'm not an official, I never claim to be, but I was on the US team. Um, this caught the attention of Warner Brothers, we're in 2009, they purchased an intellectual property out of bankruptcy called Mortal Kombat 9, right? And I was one of the guys that they came in to do the motion capture, right? First side hustle, all of a sudden, I started realizing, you know, the importance of making money, like having control of that, right? So, I'm kind of taking away, uh, doing tax returns and all of a sudden, the real estate market started to hockey stick, right? And I happened to be like forest garden with the shrimp boat captain. I wasn't so amazing, but I was just like one of the first guys who survived to participate in that market upswing, right? And I was never, my core competency was always tax law, but it never really had, but real estate happened just because I haven't been standing in the right place and it became a profit center. And today I'm a board member of the Eleanor Real Estate Law Association, I think I've done about 8,000 transactions, something like that. And it was kind of over time that I realized that, you know, value propositions, you know, they go from, they go through stages, like they go through a perceived through actual through evolving, you, they start with like you have to have a perceived value, like what he brings it to table, then you have to deliver actual value, which you do. And then you have to evolve this thing's change, right? As the market started to recover, I started to realize that real estate is such an important percentage of like the American families portfolio, right? And that's where I really started saying, okay, this real estate thing is very important because it's part of the overall like part of everyone's life. That's where I really got into it. Gotcha. And did you find that that real estate transactions were personally really fulfilling to you, like versus other types of law that you may have dabbled in? Well, what I would like about real estate transactions is, I believe in becoming fabric of the community, right? And like, and the way you truly become a fabric of community and you've got to shake the people's hands that you're serving, right? And the best way to kind of build that trust is like helping them establish a nest, right? So real estate kind of became one of our like lead generators where, you know, we would meet people to do their closing, it would transfer into like trusts in the States. And then we kind of just became there go to for everything. Yeah, imagine a state planning is like maybe the real estate transactions a nice entry point to then do the estate plan after the fact, does that happen a lot where a lot of your real estate clients be 100%. Like the thing is actually, I know this is blasphemous, right? But from from my perspective, I attorney CPA, I think we ought to offer a little bit of a broader value proposition. And right, I believe that real estate is a subsidiary of the state planning, right? Sure. I'm excited. I believe there's people who have this overall like a state plan and you do their closing kind of as part of that overall plan. I just don't know how you do a closing without knowing everybody's overall plan. We were just having this exact conversation with a real estate journalist yesterday, actually, or yeah, yesterday. And we were talking about how this is the year that REALTORS can really start to think of themselves more as a consultant where they actually try to take a broader, a broader view of the entire financial picture. And maybe that includes having conversations with the person's accountant with their attorney or with their financial advisor and really saying where does this home, if we're going to call this thing an asset, which is a debatable topic to a primary residence. I know it's an asset on the day it's sold, but is it an asset really between times? I don't know. But it's still an important piece of the financial picture, regardless of whether it's an asset or not. And it you're right. It's sort of like one of those things that, you know, when I go see a doctor, they make me fill out this massive checklist of like, what's wrong with you? What's your history? What's everything going on with your physical health entered, you know, exercise diet, et cetera, and all the stats. And your in your family history, because they need to be able to make a good recommendation and you're right. The sort of the real estate side of the, of someone's financial picture is often sort of isolated and segregated from everything else. And I imagine your, your sort of vision is to sort of integrate everything into looking at it all more holistically. Do I have that right? Yeah, well, I listen like in the end, my, my intent is the preservation of the American family. And the way you do that is by, you know, ultimately you need to make sure that they're safe, safety, and that they're secure, financially secure, right? And I don't, I believe I do continue to believe that home ownership and real estate investing is an important part of a diversified portfolio. I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss.

Yeah, and do you do you look at primary residents diff I mean, obviously it's different from a revenue person or or a revenue perspective, right. So passive income residual income through investments. Obviously we understand there's tax benefits. There's there's obviously cash flow benefits. Do you look how do you encourage clients to think of their primary resident, is it an investment, is it an asset. And these are very debatable topics, but I think it's important because I think there's there are a lot of REALTORS that could really benefit from hearing some language from an attorney about how to how to have those conversations because personally I. I would love to look at my primary residence as an investment if it goes up, but I don't have much control over that that's not the reason I bought it as much as I would love for it to double in value probably won't, but, but it is a huge chunk of, you know, the money that I've had put into that home. So curious on on how you think about primary homes versus obviously versus you know buying, you know, a multi family and renting it out. Okay, so attorney CPA perspective, yeah, primary residence is an absolutely an asset. I strongly disagree with the argument that it's a liability. I respect and understand where the other, where the argument comes from, you know, the old school at age, like your primary residence is just a liability. I just, I think it's incorrect. I believe it's an asset, especially when you start looking at things generationally, right up. Like when you start looking at these generationally primary residence. And so I think it's, if it's like incurring an unrealized game to all the CPAs out there like we're building up the store of value, whereas if you're renting, you're not building that store of value. Now, it's always possible that you overextend. I'm a big fan of Albert Einstein and I love this little equation equal equals on square. So it equals MC square essentially means is energy equals mass times his people life square right the thing I love about that equation is it proves to us that energy and mass are equivalent because if you divide, see it's an algorithm, divide, see square by both sides. It shows that they can equal each other they become young right if they are relative to each other as money is a relative thing though that you make is only relative to the money you spend. So if you overspend relative, then yes, it becomes a liability right. Like if you don't do that and you're like normal, like it's an asset, especially anything that things generationally. Well, thank you for closing the door on that that I love that you shut the door with some authority on that particular argument whether primary residents and asset and you you explained it very, very well. I think that's important. And historically home prices over time generationally have historically risen right so we can look at historical data and say well, we can't, you know, obviously we can't project that your home is going to be worth more than it is today because that would be, you know, no one has the Oracle at Delphi to our crystal ball. But but we can assume based on historical data that it's likely that if trends continue that you may be here in 20, 30, 40 years, which in case does improve the quality of that asset from, you know, from a numbers perspective. So I am, I will tell you this, I am scared about 2023 now there's always opportunity when there's fear, but I think there's I'm speaking not so much for me because truthfully I'm not a practicing agent I have my license I don't use it I sit here at a desk all day and and try to recruit people to join our company. But we have about 700 agents here and they a lot of them are nervous and a lot of my friends outside of our company who are agents are nervous about 2023 why pretty obvious reasons, of course, everyone knows we have higher interest rate environment than we did two years ago, although I don't think it's that high, but it's certainly in comparison to the last few years it's still a big a bigger pill the swallow that it was double rates, you know, it was kind of where we're at low inventory and then dropping home prices. So curious on where's the opportunity in 2023 what should REALTORS be focused on and what as an attorney do you suggest that agents start to think about to really keep their business rolling next year so that it's not as bumpy as as maybe the news is suggesting it might be. Well it's going to be bumpy is definitely going to be bumpy it's just finding the opportunity within that bumpiness right like. From my perspective all ships floating high tides right you have when times are good everybody is like amazing like one of the things I tell people is I'm like an all terrain vehicle like I work in rain slate snow as I shine so many of these single silo like attorneys that's that's all they do like they don't work when times get when there's a. So from my perspective you have to kind of approach your business like that like are you prepared for the ups and the downs we're in a cyclical business so if you want to survive in a cyclical business you have to be able to work in both cycles right so from my perspective it's identifying the like the things that people are really going to need right. Let's start with the supply side there's a limited amount of inventory out there right I believe as you see the baby burn the silver tsunami coming you're going to see these guys they're going to have to redeploy their assets right. Huge amount of assets too I mean trillions of dollars are going to flood in. Yeah so 25 trillion is going to exchange hands right now the homes are a special asset right because like they need to figure out a way to either downsize if they're going to you know pass away or to long term living you know kids are all gone. And they're going to have to figure out to do it most of those homes don't have more edges on that right so they're not worried about trading from three to seven or three to six or whatever incident I have an on I have an ongoing. That with a couple of people of the date I think it's going to drop down to five you know off offline I'll enter to that with you right that way love that anyway what you know you're going to have a lot of the baby burn or population population that they have a bleeding neck and let me restate they don't have a bleeding that they have six shotguns pointed to the back of their head that they're going to have to figure out what to do with that land right now. You're going to have a motivated seller who's going to have to figure out what to do with that supply right right then let's talk about like purchasing right number one if the consumer doesn't come in and buy these assets right you're going to have foreign money flooding you know you're so much turbulence globalization I just were not a state bar I'm shocked I got picked up so quickly but it was like it's about the collapse of globalization I think you're going to see money start coming in here from other places. And you know listen all the house hacking is really cool but when you have a couple of kids good luck doing that you're going to have to buy your house to raise your family right your parents would you raise your kids in their basement right. So the supply side is going to be the baby boomers demand side is going to be foreign money and millennials who are being forced kind of to you know as their families expand right now there is a segment of the population that they're building up. So the velocity is going to decrease dramatically right and that percentage of the population they're trapped in two to three percent interest rates made on trade out right again right listen the pie is going to get smaller and really going to have to demonstrate and show everybody which your value proposition is from my perspective. This is really going to come down to who are real real estate people and who are marketers right a lot of people in sales that their rates salesman right sure if you would go back 23 years into the real estate market before people the sales thing like the top of the funnel you know everybody came great marketers right. Real estate was a pool business what a pool business means is you get pulled into transaction you have a special skill that gets you pulled in right you guys were never intended to be in a push business it became a push business because your commissions are so lucrative that it pushed into marketing people right. But this is going to force the vendors to become hyper specialized in what they do they really got to know what they're doing and the consumer has got so got named smart right that if you don't know what they're doing you're doing they're going to know really quick yeah. So you really got to get back down to that core of like man you know what you're doing right so this is the year to really hone those are sharp in those sticks those steps. They're going to get a skill set sticks or tools in the arsenal to know more than you know the average consumer who once a month checks their estimate and see what their home values worth which of course they don't need you to do because they can just pull that up no whether that numbers accurate and not is is irrelevant but that's what they're going to do so you need to be able to bring value in between transactions right so person what buys and sells every what seven years or whatever the status so here's a great question. I'm sorry I don't know if it's a great question I shouldn't say my own questions are great but here's a question that I think would be of great value to our audience which is and you're not you're not a practicing broker but you work with REALTORS and you work with homeowners not a fraction. You do everything else but the broker is very important to me I like listen you know I'm and it's very hard to break this shell right but I will be vulnerable to tell you. The importance of the broker right and I want my perspective my sole agenda is the preservation of the American wealth ecosystem for a family right and most people have less than a thousand dollars in their bank account like 80s like I think it's like 78 or 80% something like that have less than 1000 dollars that is that is horribly depressing and unfortunately true so many people land do you do you want to do that. Read all these articles. JP Morgan bought a billion dollars in my hand you know this read bought a billion dollars blackstone but 50 billion you know why they do that. You know I actually don't know why they do because it's a good idea it works. Yes. That church does a similar thing too they buy a lot of land. You've been proved if you buy it I'll be a more aggressive you're dancing and you're saying oh like you know it might not go it's going to go up it's a store of value right. I I used to have a I had a friend who was an attorney who's worked for the Catholic church and her job no joke in in the US and I'm sure they have these positions all over the world was to buy land where they could put schools Catholic schools Catholic. Education which courses its own business and a huge business but the big thing was not we want to we don't want to rent space we want to buy the land put the school on it and it's part and this is this is her full time job just finding land for schools. So the reason why they do that is because it works so really good idea right. Like especially American dirt American dirt American breaking orders amazing right. Like this morning what are the important things that you've done and I asked you what did you do when you first I went to the gym I'd say that's for me that's probably the most important thing I did. What did you do after you went to the gym. I came back started started thinking about recruiting more REALTORS. I took a shower this morning yes. Okay so what do you need to take shower. What do I why did I take a shower what do I need. You need to take a shower so you need water and electricity well you don't need electricity but I use electricity. You need water right so we live in one of the biggest areas of fresh water so before I was you know I worked at a lot of firm called yield. It's like number three in all of Asia and soul South Korea right I thought I was a big shot right anyway I met this big big shot law firm right and I go to get my place my little studio right and I find out how expensive those I think whoa that's how much it costs for this like studio that's crazy. It turns out if you sold South Korea you could buy France eight times that's how expensive the land is right. It's one of the cool interesting things about South Korea we got a river that goes right through the soul and stuff like that. Toronto by ocean right and you can't drink ocean water or bay than it right so all of a sudden water becomes scarcity. So like for someone like me I recognize like the relevant the relative importance of water right where people here you know you take an hour long shower and when you cares right which is in the world like it becomes a really good deal. So I guess what I'm trying to say is like we ultimately the land that you purchase needs to have a value a reason why people like it right our soil is very abundant in natural resources which allows you to have an incoherence on growth right and we have water. So like you know so long as the resource resources remain consistent like in theory as long as the value of commodity goes up so low the value of the land relative to the value of commodity right sure really it's a good investment as well people come along the stuff. Yeah it makes it makes perfect perfect sense so REALTOR's right now are thinking okay I've got a lot of my clientele refinanced or purchased in the last couple of years when the interest rates were low and obviously a lot didn't but the ones that did you know I what do I first of all do we say anything to the person who's at a 3% rate right now. Who is feeling like I can't move because if I move I'm going to a 6.5% rate what are what are we saying to those what do you suggest we say to those people if anything at all right now. So do you have your handy dandy computer there I do. And you look at JP Morgan Chase buys a billion dollar of single family homes. Yeah looking it up right now. Yeah here's got it. Yeah single family rentals a billion dollars earlier this November yeah. What date is that. So the news articles November 16th. Okay would you agree November 16th that's like a month ago right like the rate for in the 6th is a 7th. Yeah. You want to know why they're buying that they're doing that I want to know why Jamie diamond does anything so yes tell me. It's a really good idea because he's a really smart guy. They saw the interest rates go up and they eliminated all the competition. Yeah. I interest rates went out they eliminated the competition they go in and acquire do the acquisition so like the first of all. I do think the mortgage interest rates are going to go down right let me open with that right so with that said. I do believe that it is probably not a smart idea to wait until they go down to buy. Because the second they go down you're going to have this huge award of competition coming out they're going to bid up the prices again. Which is what happened when in 3% rates same exact things happen. 100% like what you want to do is you want to try to go in there where there's. And that's the cost of money that I'm going to put out my old to medium competition exactly when JPMORI Chase is doing to you. It's hilarious right you're own big price to you out and that is my own bank that's funny yeah your own bank price to you also they can buy your land it's hilarious right. It really got to be conscious of when that rate goes down, everybody's gonna flint in. Now, you gotta make that decision, but if I were to broke, if I was in your business, right, this is a dialogue that I would be having with my people. Hey, forget about the industry. Put that to the side for a second. Tell me about your needs. Are you in a one-bedroom condo with one kid and you're about to have a second kid? You're saying it can work, right? Let's go find you something that's within your budget that meets the needs of your family. Hey, are you, is your parent 65? How are they doing? Do you think that they're gonna be in a nursing home? Do they have long-term coverage? If they don't, like you need to have these things in mind for them, right? Can we just do a public service announcement and break for just a moment? Can we talk about long-term care? And not get into the weeds about it, but I know you beat, you've been beat, you beat the drum on long-term care insurance, and I'm so grateful for you to do this because there are so many people. So everyone listening, if your parents are elderly, can you just give the quick little 30 second on why everybody's parents need to have long-term care? Okay, so most people don't have long-term care. Which is insane. Well, what long-term care means is, if your parents are unable to function on their own, and they have to go like they get to mention, they gotta go to the assisted living in nursing home or something like that, those places are really expensive, right? So you need to have insurance policy to cover the cost of that. Now, assuming that you don't have that, because most of you will have it, right? The only way to afford that is, let's say they get a pension of 4,000, right? And let's say you find them in nursing home, that's 6,000. The nursing home will allow them to come in, take the 4,000 a month, right? And the gap, the delta, they will normally get covered under Medicaid through Illinois. Now, Medicaid is provided by the state, but funded by the facts, right? Now, the catch of getting that free Medicaid is if your parents own a house free and clear, which most baby will understand, they paid it off, right? The state can turn around and attach a lien against the equity with a five-year look back. They can go back five years to any money that they paid on your parents behalf to live there, right? So they can essentially lose the asset that they were, that they've built. So if anybody's out there thinking generation, well, we gotta have that in the back of your head. Yeah, just ask your parents if they have long-term care insurance, talk to a financial advisor, get that done, because I don't even remember what the average cost is for facility care these days, but I wanna say for a year, it's $10,000? Yeah, it's a lot. It's tens and tens of thousands of dollars. Okay, anyway, back to our regularly scheduled program, but this really ties in long-term care, because you were talking about generational wealth and nothing wipes out generational wealth faster than managed care for elderly people. So I'm glad we were able to do our public service announcement of the year, but let's talk about, okay. So back to being a REALTOR. So I'm thinking about our audience, we're REALTORS, we're worried about 2023, interest rates are up, which means the average consumer thinks they're not getting a deal right now, right? They're not getting a deal. You said, don't wait for it to try, don't try to time the market, don't wait for the interest rates to come down. Why not? Because when they do come down, what's gonna happen is every single person who's waiting on the sidelines, they're gonna jump in all at the same time. Like if I was a REALTOR, so here, let's talk damage control of your REALTOR. You got to right size your business right now. If you believe that your top line revenue is gonna decrease 20%, you got to go line on by line on them and you got to decrease your expenses 20%, real simple. Okay, right size your company. If you're caring too much fat right now, it's time to carve a fat out, right? So that's step one, do that first. That's something you should be doing right now, right? Step two, once you've right size your company, I would turn my attention to just educating your client on like real, real list, no, I would turn to listening to your client on what their needs are. If you know that they're gonna have a need to like, you know, move, then step three, talk to them about the difference between the interest rate and like competition because when the competition comes flooding in, dude, I think it's gonna be a big wave. People get priced out. Yeah, it's, let's all remember what happened with the sub four percent rates in the last couple of years. Remember, you know, if we had listings, it was Feast or Famine, right? If you had listings, you were feasting and if you were working with buyers, whoop, it was tough. You were submitting offers site unseen, you were getting, you know, 30 plus offers and trying to get yours noticed. And it is, remember how hard that was to sort of thread that perfect needle, you know, it was difficult back then. So I think you're bringing up a good point. And maybe if looking at the math, maybe the metrics are such that you would have overpaid two years ago, despite the fact that you were in a lower interest rate environment. And maybe now, even though higher interest rates lower pricing, maybe it actually evens out more than the consumer might think. 100%. Yeah. If you get a, if you get a lower, lower, my father paid for his house, he paid $55,000 for his house, but it was like a 10% interest rate. So it's not a lot, right? So if you get a discount on the retail price, it oftentimes it is of equaling out, right? But the one thing I will say to everybody is, let's be honest guys, the last two years was probably the greatest rush of real estate velocity and we'll probably never see that again, right? The rates are never gonna get that low. You're never gonna see that again, right? Right now you gotta turn your attention to right sizing your operations and providing that value to the consumer. And the consumer is hyper-ridical right now. And like you said at the very beginning, they have access to everything. Now, so, you know, we all have access to everything. It's in our pockets that we walk around with, you know, this basically magical device that tells us anything we wanna know at any time for free essentially. And so as an agent, so a couple of things I got from what you were saying. Number one, a lot of agents are going to be exiting the business who work true, full all in agents. The part-timers, the onesy-toosies, they're going to start to slowly exit the business or just become less relevant. So we're probably gonna see some sort of exodus for agents, which is a great thing for agents that are looking to scale up and grow their business. Because there is gonna be less competition. A lot of the maybe poor quality agents will be leaving the industry. The stronger agents, the really savvy value added agents will continue to thrive. But in order to get there, you have to do the heavy lifting, which is what you were talking about is sharpening the tools. This is the year 2023 where you really want to be better. What do you recommend for agents to study? As far as like a daily practice, and again, I know you're not a practicing agent per se, but what do you wish agents knew from an attorney's perspective? What do you wish agents were better at? I always believe in marketing, like how you consume, right? Like you should market to people where you consume as a consumer, right? You know, I was like as a consumer, right? My family, when we first got here from Korea, we got heavily involved in real estate because we were in the restaurant business. We sold, we were number one in the state and used restaurant market. We had like 200,000 square feet of like restaurants stuff, right? So we would, we needed to buy big locations to house the equipment, right? And one of the things that I think we found important from people is like you really have to know the assets that you're selling, you're helping someone buy, right? The thing, if you're in the condom business, right? Did you really got to know that HLA before you get your environment, right? If you don't have, if you have no idea of the financial health of that HLA, like if you're just hoping that the attorney catches it from the 22.1, like that's what you're doing. That's crazy to me. Like you really got to know these things here. I'll give you an example from an attorney's perspective. In 16 years, I've probably done 8,000 transactions. Whenever I catch something on the 22.1, right? The 22.1 is a financial snapshot which shows capital upcoming unexpected or expected capital expenditures. Whenever I catch something and I tell the buyer, this is what immediately happens. I press send on the email, send. But it ain't, hey, Dad, thanks for catching that thing. Why in the hell did my REALTOR not tell me about that? Yeah. Right, 100 out of 100 doesn't happen, right? Like if you're going to go into a building, you've got to know what's going on with the building, right? So that's if you're in the condom business. If you're in like the single family home business, you got to kind of have some sort of idea of the neighborhood you're putting people in, right? You gotta say like, I know there's restrictions on what you can disclose, right? But you gotta talk to your client and let them understand like, hey, this is wonderful school systems, communities and this and that. And they gotta know what's going on. Like for me personally, whenever I do like investing, I like when I invest in, let's take single family homes, for example, I believe that you have to control one of three things to be a real estate investor. You gotta control the dirt, the tenant with money, one of those straight, dirt tenant money. So I like tenant control. Tenant control is the coolest to me, right? So what I like to do is I like to buy single family homes in the best school districts. And I am the cheapest rent in the best school districts. That's my model, right? I love that. That's what every parent, not every parent, but what parents want to live in the school districts, not every parent in the best school district, not every parent can afford that. So you want to make the affordable option for people to enter that education space. 100% 100% I want to be the most affordable in the best school district. That's my value proposition. That's the product that I offer, right? Now like to me, like I really know what the product that I'm buying, right? Like surgery, right? And it can be like when you're a broker, the customer sees that you're walking away with a big commission check, right? And they see the inspector getting paid six-fair bucks. They see the attorney get paid six, 700 bucks, right? If like the inspection I get, if there's something that you couldn't have found, totally get it, right? But if they find out that there's an atomic bomb there, right? 999 times out of a thousand, they're mad at me. They call me and they're like, dude, what the hell happened? How come people would know about this, right? There's an outcome, there's, of course, we got a great deal. There's a $70,000 special assessment coming up. Sure. Right? You know what I mean? Yeah. Of course we got a great deal. This is going to be a deconversion, right? Like, you know, stuff like that. So realizing that REALTORS are highly compensated for the transaction and not taking that responsibility lightly and really providing over-providing value or providing more value than would be expected so that the consumer never calls the attorney who got paid the six or $700 and goes, how come you caught this in my agent who just got 10 grand, didn't catch it? Like, I actually think, you know, given like your, your role in the transaction, top of the funnel, defending value, I don't think you're unfairly compensated, right? But I don't think it's an unfair compensation, but you have to, like, if you don't know the product that you're selling, like really know it and the client finds out that you're highly compensated and you don't know what you're selling, they give them. Yeah, I've had this fantasy in, and I don't know, it probably will never come true, but I want, I would love real estate to move away from, for REALTORS how they're compensated, to move away from transaction, to work to more sort of, like a financial advisory model where it's, you know, assets under management, fee-based model, you know, you get a percentage. I don't know if it'll ever happen. I don't know if it's possible, but boy, that would really change the game, I think. I don't know if the, I actually, you know, I respect the counter-argument, but I actually think with the, I don't think they're unfairly compensated, right? I think what they do is legit, and here's why, ultimately, their job is to defend the value. Yeah. That's ultimately their job, right, to defend value. And if you defend the value, it's worth it, right? You know, it's worth it. It's worth it. But if you don't defend the value, then it really becomes a problem, right? And that's the thing you really are gonna have to know. Like, I recently, I did a wholesale deal where, you know, they flipped the contract, and it was a big number. Right. Huge number. The sellers got so angry at the listing. They'd have to, of course. They were like, how the hell did you get this number wrong, right? I'm sorry about that. They were like, how the hell did you get this number wrong? Right? Your entire reason you're here is to value that, right? So like, if you stand by that, like, it makes sense because it's, that is the most important thing, which is the value at all, right? So I actually think the number is fair, but you really have to know that. You just can't be a guy or gal who switched careers. You're really good at marketing, has a great network. Don't know the product and sells it. That's what is gonna get a little scary. Yeah. So sharpen your tools, learn the inventory, learn the market, learn what to look for. You know, with respect to closings, especially condo, you were saying HOA stuff. Yeah, boy, because all of us, you know, consumers, when we're buying something, I, as long as I've been in this industry, I've always thought, because I'm not a practicing agent, I always thought, doesn't everybody just wanna know, is this a good idea? That's really kind of what we all want. Like, should I buy that? Should I not buy that? And I really think REALTORS say, I'll help you buy that. But I really, what I want a REALTOR to do is say, you should buy that or you shouldn't. And in order to make that distinction or that recommendation, you really do have to have some pretty sharp tools in your, or sharp arrows in your quiver. But this is the year to develop that, because if you can become the person that gives it vice, and again, depending on what state you live in, you have to obviously, you wanna be compliant, make sure you're not running a foul of compliance rules. But whatever is allowed, I think the real value is in the advice. Obviously pricing advice, should I buy this, should I sell this, well, how should I do it? I just, I love having people giving me advice in my life, my service providers. That's really what I want for my account and my attorney, my financial advisor, my trainer. I want them telling me, you should do this. Mm-hmm, 100%. I think that's the direction everything's gonna go. And I think if you do that, market goes up, market goes down. There will always be people who need help. And if they know that you could help them, and whether it's an upper-down market that you can help, you're gonna be fine.
