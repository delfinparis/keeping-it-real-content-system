[00:01:14] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:17] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:21] Now as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:23] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:26] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:28] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:31] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting
[00:01:32] and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:36] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:39] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:41] and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:45] to leave you.
[00:01:46] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:49] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:51] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:54] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:55] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:01:59] for each agent in your market
[00:02:00] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:04] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went
[00:02:07] and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:08] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:10] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:12] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:15] based on that agent's needs
[00:02:17] and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:18] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:20] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:22] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:25] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:27] corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:02:53] Hello and welcome to Keeping It Real,
[00:02:56] the largest podcast made by real estate agents
[00:02:58] and four real estate agents.
[00:03:00] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:01] I'm your guide and host through this show in just a moment.
[00:03:04] We're going to be speaking with one of the world's top agents,
[00:03:07] Ben Bacall.
[00:03:09] What a fun episode this was to record.
[00:03:11] I want you to pay particular attention
[00:03:13] to the way in which Ben prospects.
[00:03:17] It will most likely surprise you
[00:03:19] and hopefully inspire you to maybe do the same.
[00:03:23] Also, we have just launched a new video series,
[00:03:26] short form video series called AI agent minute.

[00:03:38] Hit that subscribe button every other day.
[00:03:40] What I do is I post AI prompt that either a top 1% agent
[00:03:46] told me that they use themselves or one that I am crafted
[00:03:49] for you to use.
[00:03:51] You could drop right into chat GPT to take your business
[00:03:53] to the next level.
[00:03:55] I would appreciate that.
[00:03:56] Let me know what you think about those videos
[00:03:58] and let's get right to it.
[00:04:00] My conversation with Ben Bacall.
[00:04:02] 
[00:04:02] I'm Ben Bacall.
[00:04:06] I'm Ben Bacall.
[00:04:07] I'm Ben Bacall.
[00:04:12] I'm Ben Bacall.
[00:04:13] I'm Ben Bacall.
[00:04:16] My conversation with Ben Bacall.
[00:04:16] 
[00:04:16] Best piece of advice you ever received
[00:04:18] in real estate?
[00:04:20] Best piece of advice I ever received in real estate
[00:04:24] is you can find two ultra high net worth clients.
[00:04:29] and if you can maintain those relationships for your career, that could set the base for you just to take off forever.
[00:04:41] Yeah, makes sense. Oh, wow. Definitely excited to hear more about that. Worst piece of advice you ever received in real estate?
[00:04:51] My geographic farm is more than two areas when I started real estate. It would be the worst.
[00:04:59] Meaning you should have only had one or you should have expanded. No, only had like one. Yeah, we're in Chicago.
[00:05:06] We have 77 neighborhoods just in the city and you're in L.A. So obviously you have a similar situation there.
[00:05:14] Pick one of the calls. Is that a dominant right? Yeah, that's right.
[00:05:18] Ben McCall is my guest today. He is the founder of the Rev. Real Estate in Beverly Hills. He has a huge, huge presence there, a huge team.
[00:05:28] Let me tell you more about Ben. Ben is one of the world's top real estate agents with over four billion in sales and a client roster that includes celebrities like Matt Damon, Ellen DeGeneres and Madonna known for his discretion and his innovation.
[00:05:41] Ben helped transform the value of L.A.'s most exclusive neighborhoods, including record breaking deals like a 94 million bell air sale since 2005.
[00:05:50] He's been at the forefront of technology and design and real estate, founding several platforms, including Rila, dubbed the Instagram of real estate by Forbes.
[00:05:58] Today, Ben leads Rev. Real Estate, a company reimagining the Asian experience through cutting edge tools, support and freedom.

[00:06:29] Thank you for having me. This is cool.
[00:06:32] It's very cool for me to be able to talk to you because you have a very unique business and a very unique value proposition and it's rarefied air to some degree.
[00:06:46] I'm doing the show for seven years and I always really love talking to agents that are so highly specialized.
[00:06:54] I really want to get back to the beginning of the story or get to the beginning of the story so that our listeners can hear how you started and how you ascended in building your business.
[00:07:07] How did you get into real estate?
[00:07:08] My mother is a broker in Canada and I watched her in excruciating pain dealing with her clients and I said I want to live a life of an extreme anxiety for the rest of my life.
[00:07:26] So let me do that for a business like mother likes son.
[00:07:29] I love that.
[00:07:34] It is funny but Toronto is a particularly challenging market.
[00:07:42] People can't sell their houses there.
[00:07:44] Right. Yes.
[00:07:47] The bubble has burst.
[00:07:48] Is your mom still practicing?
[00:07:57] She's not.
[00:07:59] That's helped me in my trajectory in my career.
[00:08:03] Yes. So you moved out to LA when you were 17?
[00:08:08] Yeah, Toronto.
[00:08:10] And then tell us how you got involved in real estate.
[00:08:14] Yeah.
[00:08:15] I was making movies and going to film school so I wanted to make enough money to buy IP and make short films and videos.
[00:08:28] And then I just got addicted to my first deal.
[00:08:33] After doing 30 days grow and working closely with the heads of the family, it was a small deal.
[00:08:43] I'm sorry, it sounds so grand.
[00:08:46] But just this family that I was working with in Venice Beach, it was so cool that they entrusted me with this $1.4 million deal in Venice.
[00:08:55] It was like, wow, this is cool.
[00:08:57] I'm 25 years old and I just closed their sale and they're so happy and I got them another property.
[00:09:02] And that felt really, really, and powerful so that the whole process from putting it out there and marketing and negotiations was exciting.
[00:09:12] So I was like, okay, I'm going to stop.
[00:09:14] In the entertainment business, I like.
[00:09:16] I love homes and I love people and.
[00:09:22] Yeah, that's how it happened.
[00:09:23] I was door knocking in Venice Beach.
[00:09:26] So my, my, my mother being the agent, she goes, bad, you need to focus on just the low end of the real estate market.
[00:09:36] This was just right after the, you know, the bubble burst here in 2008.
[00:09:40] Right.
[00:09:40] And my first year real estate, I made about, I made $394,000 in my first year.
[00:09:47] Amazing.
[00:09:47] Which I didn't realize how that it was amazing until I own a brokerage and have, you know, 65 agents and realize how, you know, determined you want has to be in order to be here at your top, right.
[00:10:03] So I didn't give up.
[00:10:04] I didn't let my head hit the pillow every night until I probably talked to, you know, dozens of people and asked hundreds of people during the week if they wanted to sell their home.
[00:10:14] And make not thousands.
[00:10:16] Wow.
[00:10:16] So you were, you were literally prospecting just nonstop.
[00:10:21] Just nonstop.
[00:10:22] And I was just like, I got to see who I can't stop door knocking or call calling until someone says yes that day.
[00:10:28] And then I would, and then I would go home and be like, okay.
[00:10:31] And then I would be dreaming about the people I'm talking about thinking who I, who have to call next to follow up with.
[00:10:38] And back then there wasn't really any CRM systems.
[00:10:41] I'm like, that was that long ago, 2005 or there was there was like high rise that I used.
[00:10:47] And they were not that intuitive.
[00:10:49] Definitely know, no, AI at that point, no, no machine learning in large language models to like help me, you know, direct my focus on to different people.
[00:11:00] But I would lose a lot of deals like every, every week I go in that must make all my forgot to look at listed on no e did like a list of all Millwood I knocked on that door.
[00:11:09] I talked to that person.
[00:11:11] And it was like I was beat, it was always beating myself up because I probably could have made a million dollars that first year.
[00:11:17] I just followed up and has like a proper proper systems in place.
[00:11:21] And it's amazing. It's like, you know, you, as you think back, it's like I shot for the, what is the expression I shot for the sun I landed on the moon.
[00:11:30] You know, it's like you still landed pretty, pretty, pretty far out there like you still had a great year.
[00:11:34] But as you look back, you go, oh, there were a lot of inconsistencies that I could have done even better.
[00:11:40] I want to talk about door knocking for a moment because everyone who's listening who is never doorked probably cringes at the thought of a doork.
[00:11:49] And you know, how did you, was that something that was easy for you and curious to know like what your approach was there.
[00:11:59] Well, you know, it's all about your approach.
[00:12:03] Like he said, it's all about your intention.
[00:12:06] So I often went out with intention of a client that I was actually genuinely looking for.
[00:12:12] So it came from a place of authenticity.
[00:12:16] And also was very conversational.
[00:12:19] So I'll like take out my agents that I recruit that come to the office, even if they've done 50, you know, $100 million or maybe they've done 10 or 20.
[00:12:30] They, I talk about, I talk about doork knocking they go, will you go doork knocking with me?
[00:12:33] And I'm like, you guess what I was like, yeah, I'll come doork knocking with you if you promise to go five more times without me and talk to 20 people a day.
[00:12:42] So it's the approach is I go out and I'm calm. It's more conversational.
[00:12:46] You know, I walk by a door. I saw see it all.
[00:12:50] It looked pretty house and unlock. I'm like, hey, just one let you know.
[00:12:54] My client was looking in your neighbor, your house is so gorgeous.
[00:12:58] Oh, thank you so much.
[00:13:00] Yeah.
[00:13:00] Like, yeah, it's, how long have you lived here for?
[00:13:04] Whatever a couple of years, I'm like, listen, I know maybe probably don't want to, but if you ever want to sell, I've got a great buyer.
[00:13:10] You totally, you love your house. I'd love to do.
[00:13:13] And then they'll be like, well, thank you. We're staying here. We're leaving feet first. I'm like, okay, no problem.
[00:13:18] If you have any, any friends or, you know, family that want to move in the neighborhood, I have a lot of off market deals and they be able to get your number.
[00:13:26] And then I'll put my phone out and I'll say, what's your number? And I'll say it out loud.
[00:13:30] That way they actually give me the number because most of the time they'll say, leave your card.
[00:13:34] Sure.
[00:13:34] In the mailbox.
[00:13:36] But it's more, you know, I honestly say with me smiling and matching, mirroring.
[00:13:44] Sure.
[00:13:44] How they're reacting to me will create an instant rapport and a trust that will hopefully cultivate into a phone number, a contact, an email, follow up.
[00:13:55] And then they become my, you know, my friend and I provide them value over the years and I just, you know, either I provide the value by bringing them up the buyer.
[00:14:02] If they want to make money or if they're not ready, you just want to create a relationship.
[00:14:06] Sure.
[00:14:07] And not be a pushy salesman.
[00:14:09] So I think I attribute a lot of that door knocking success. I wasn't too salesy and I direct to the point that was actually confident.
[00:14:17] Even in my early days of what my intention was and what my what I wanted to accomplish in it and it came off as as as important to listen to me what I had to say to these people.
[00:14:30] It's the last one is there's a day when there wasn't rings anymore.
[00:14:34] So the ring camera doesn't help too much.
[00:14:37] That's true.
[00:14:38] Yeah, it probably makes it a little, a little bit more challenging.
[00:14:40] But what is I want to sort of unpack this a little bit and because I've done 700 of these episodes over the last seven years.
[00:14:49] You're the you might be while my memory is terrible.
[00:14:52] So you might not be the first person that I've ever interviewed for door knocking.
[00:14:55] But let's say you are because I think you actually are.
[00:14:58] And I do want to talk about this because it is an absolute no go for so many people to even consider.
[00:15:06] And the way that you described it by the way what I anticipated you saying before we got to door knocking was well, yeah, I worked in the entertainment industry.
[00:15:14] I was behind the scenes.
[00:15:15] I was you know with all these production companies and I just kind of leveraged that network to build by business.
[00:15:21] And you did not say that you said, oh, I went out and knocked on strangers doors.
[00:15:25] And I was like, oh my god, how did you do that?
[00:15:27] And the way that you just explained it made all the sense in the world because it really is kind of a low stakes situation.
[00:15:34] You're not asking for a sale.
[00:15:36] You're not selling a product or even a service.
[00:15:39] You're literally saying, oh, my I have somebody that is looking in this neighborhood or I just help somebody in this neighborhood.
[00:15:46] I need more homes like yours.
[00:15:50] So when you are ready, please call me.
[00:15:52] And it's kind of an easy yes.
[00:15:54] There's not really any commitment they're giving other than wow, this person just flattered my property and gave me a nice compliment.
[00:16:03] And also, you're a super nice person.
[00:16:06] So that also I don't quite understand the apprehension with getting out there because especially if you live in sunny California, you have no excuse.
[00:16:17] Most of us sitting at their computer hurting their back all day, you can get out there and feel the sun, get some vitamin D and go talk to 20 random people.
[00:16:25] And it doesn't have to be so like door to door to door to door.
[00:16:27] You can just sure how's that you like.
[00:16:29] I listen, I doorknucked and then I elevated my game.
[00:16:35] And I cut my teeth on more expensive properties.
[00:16:37] That's also another problem.
[00:16:39] People are so eager to get into the luxury.
[00:16:41] They see like these high flying ticket items being sold for 20, 30, 40.
[00:16:46] I want to go there.
[00:16:48] It took me like five years to start selling my first six million dollar home.
[00:16:53] Some people, there's been anomalies that have like gone right to the top and sold 10, 20 million dollars within two years.
[00:16:58] But it took me a minute.
[00:16:59] But I built my database.
[00:17:02] So for instance, I doorknucked in, I guess it was probably like 2010.
[00:17:10] And that house was owned by a surgeon medium logo.
[00:17:15] And I stayed in touch with them.
[00:17:17] And I called them, you know, every year to see if I could bring a buyer.
[00:17:22] He ended up selling the property to a basketball star.
[00:17:25] So I missed it on that sale.
[00:17:26] But I kept on calling and guess what?
[00:17:29] I sold that home last year for $150 million.
[00:17:34] Amazing.
[00:17:35] All because I doorknucked and met that relationship and stayed in touch.
[00:17:39] And yeah, you know, that's how that's that.
[00:17:42] You know, but there's another part of that equation.
[00:17:45] It's your social etiquette and your emotional maturity.
[00:17:49] Yes.
[00:17:49] And if either you had that or you don't, you know how to communicate with people.
[00:17:57] And it's not a high pressure situation.
[00:18:00] Just the way you talk to people.
[00:18:01] My dad's a psycho man, a psycho from a family.
[00:18:04] I guess I'm blessed in that sense that I'm fortunate to have grown up in, you know,
[00:18:09] a middle class family in Canada.
[00:18:12] And I'm surrounded myself with other highly intelligent people that had common sense.
[00:18:19] And courtesy and decency in the world and appreciated, you know,
[00:18:24] what it is to what it is to have emotions and be cognizant of other people's feelings and,
[00:18:29] and let people be heard instead of talking at them.
[00:18:33] So it's that like, you know,
[00:18:37] it's how people want to communicate.
[00:18:39] And that's why I don't think, you know,
[00:18:40] A.I. is not going to take this whole business away.
[00:18:43] Because people want that emotional connection.
[00:18:45] And that's what REALTORS give.
[00:18:47] And they're able to really, it's a huge at stake business.
[00:18:52] You know, it's a huge, you know, it's your,
[00:18:55] it's often 30, 40% of people's in that work.
[00:18:59] So they want to be able to talk to somebody, right?
[00:19:02] Absolutely.
[00:19:02] And I also, again, I'm just, I'm going back to the,
[00:19:05] this approach of the cold open,
[00:19:08] which is essentially what you're doing.
[00:19:11] And what you're doing is it's,
[00:19:12] it's a very smart play because it is,
[00:19:17] for example, I live in a condo building.
[00:19:19] So it would be harder for somebody to do this for me.
[00:19:22] In fact, we'd have a security issue if somebody was able to knock on my door.
[00:19:25] But the idea of maybe receiving a letter in the mail or phone call,
[00:19:30] possibly, I'm sure I'm sure my phone number's out there.
[00:19:34] And I don't think everybody knows that I have a real estate license.
[00:19:37] I don't use my license.
[00:19:38] So the irony is I don't even use my license.
[00:19:41] But I don't think that's not the reason I'm not getting calls.
[00:19:45] I don't think that's the reason I'm not getting calls.
[00:19:47] And I suspect, you know, it would be very flattering if somebody said,
[00:19:51] hey, I know you moved in five years ago.
[00:19:53] Yeah.
[00:19:54] And you're, I don't know what your life situation is.
[00:19:57] It's a buyer, real family.
[00:19:59] We have to.
[00:19:59] Yeah.
[00:20:00] Or just.
[00:20:01] I love that way.
[00:20:02] That is a, is that letter thing you've seen the, the kernel of the idea.
[00:20:06] That's a former prospecting.
[00:20:08] Sure.
[00:20:08] If you're not door knocking in every day,
[00:20:11] then you're calling that a letter.
[00:20:13] You can write a letter and you can be very specific about who that,
[00:20:18] that person is, right?
[00:20:20] That personification of that family.
[00:20:22] Yeah.
[00:20:22] What seems so is real.
[00:20:24] And you could say my client's looking for this kind of property,
[00:20:28] which is your property and your address, handwritten.
[00:20:31] Yeah.
[00:20:31] If you put in that work and handwrite letters,
[00:20:33] that's what your, your risk is going to be hurting by the end of the day.
[00:20:36] 100.
[00:20:37] We're feet are going to be pain and pain from door knocking.
[00:20:40] You're going to be tired.
[00:20:41] You can, you can, you can put more sunscreen on.
[00:20:43] You're, you're thirsty.
[00:20:44] You need to go to the bathroom.
[00:20:46] Your, your through throat is tired.
[00:20:48] You're like done with the rejection.
[00:20:50] That's when you know you're going to be successful.
[00:20:52] Yeah.
[00:20:54] And if you're not 10 times better than anyone out there in this business.
[00:20:58] Yeah.
[00:20:59] Then this is, this is a part time game.
[00:21:01] And that's okay.
[00:21:02] Maybe people just, you know, they want to, you know,
[00:21:05] you want to live a life of uncertainty and, you know,
[00:21:08] you want to build wealth, wealth, generation, no wealth.
[00:21:11] Then that's where you want to be.
[00:21:13] But if you want to be at the top of your game,
[00:21:15] you got to be, you have to be 10 times better than everyone else.
[00:21:18] And, and there's very few people.
[00:21:20] That's why they say 90% of the business is done by what?
[00:21:23] 10% at the top, right?
[00:21:24] 
[00:21:24] Because they just, they, they work their tail off, you know, they're consistent.
[00:21:29] Yeah, they do.
[00:21:29] I've interviewed some of the very top agents in, in the world, including your,
[00:21:34] now, now adding you to the list as well.
[00:21:36] And I've been doing that for years and, and I do ask like,
[00:21:40] what's your secret?
[00:21:41] And usually it's, I just, I work people, you know,
[00:21:44] I'm not, I'm not necessarily, you're, you got to be, you know,
[00:21:47] you're going to give the gap, be relatable, be a kind person,
[00:21:52] smile, be confident, understand your market,
[00:21:54] know the values and talk to 20 people today.
[00:21:57] And follow up with them.
[00:21:58] Yeah.
[00:21:58] That's it.
[00:21:59] It's, it's, it's, it's, it's as simple as that.
[00:22:02] And then you have to like get out there and make connections.
[00:22:04] And if you build a good reputation,
[00:22:06] and other agents respect you, that is, and then you can,
[00:22:10] you'll sell a lot of property that is not on the open market.
[00:22:14] So you can, you can, you can, you can match, you know,
[00:22:17] people to properties and, and you can do that at any price point.
[00:22:21] So that's, that's also vital, I think, relationships, building relationships.
[00:22:26] And, and I think that one of my sellers who was a broke,
[00:22:29] sorry, one of my, what am I, what am I sellers?
[00:22:32] One of my buyers, he's a buyer and seller.
[00:22:33] So he taught me an important lesson.
[00:22:35] He said, you know, bend this business is about sharing, right?
[00:22:39] You want to share.
[00:22:41] So, you know, if I, if someone, if I mean interviewed for a listing that expired,
[00:22:48] that's, you know, maybe, you know, that's fair game.
[00:22:51] But if you want to work with everyone in your community as agents,
[00:22:54] they're, they're your life run, right?
[00:22:56] And then the buyers and sellers will come, but you want to,
[00:22:59] you really want to work closely with other agents.
[00:23:01] And you want to be sharing with them.
[00:23:02] You know, my company revel, if I see an agent come in,
[00:23:07] and he is everything that we're talking about, he or she,
[00:23:10] and they're putting in the effort and they put in the work and they're,
[00:23:13] and they're, they're consistent.
[00:23:14] And I, I will actually put them on my listing and offer them like a service fee,
[00:23:19] so they can build their repertoire of getting to 10, 20 millenux.
[00:23:23] So they have a resume.
[00:23:24] Yeah.
[00:23:24] I did that myself.
[00:23:25] I didn't have any.
[00:23:26] It's very generous.
[00:23:27] You do that for me.
[00:23:28] But that's what I do with my company, you know, you'll see if you go to anyone,
[00:23:31] one of my listings, you'll see me and LA one and LA two,
[00:23:35] which is in the multiple listing service and all this hand just other,
[00:23:37] my people in my office, that way they have a resume.
[00:23:42] So sharing is important.
[00:23:44] Does that make sense?
[00:23:45] You know, sharing not, not, not, not, not in that respect,
[00:23:47] just like in, in the commissions, you know, of course,
[00:23:50] as a broker, we get in the middle of, you know,
[00:23:52] the commission just puts within the offices, you know,
[00:23:55] what is time, who walked through the property and so forth.
[00:23:58] And that's always something fun to navigate.
[00:24:02] But, but the idea of you, at least putting them on the official listing
[00:24:08] as LA one and two, is really a generous thing.
[00:24:13] I, again, maybe other people I've interviewed do that.
[00:24:16] I've never heard anybody say they do it with basically every listing,
[00:24:20] especially for, you know, more junior agents.
[00:24:23] I, I can't imagine what that must do to some, the loyalty.
[00:24:28] These agents must have for, for revel and, and you know,
[00:24:31] people know this, but if they look at them,
[00:24:33] alas, they can see, they can see that I do that.
[00:24:35] But about, but you know, you have to be with me for a certain amount, you know,
[00:24:38] sure, of course, to gain, to gain that trust or,
[00:24:41] or if I actually see that you're a go getter, right?
[00:24:45] That, you know, you're a go getter and you're making that happen
[00:24:47] and you're closing sales.
[00:24:48] That's much more important, right?
[00:24:50] Because if you're not closing, then you pretty much know
[00:24:52] they're, if they're putting in that, that 110% right?
[00:24:59] Absolutely.
[00:25:00] I'm sure when you get interviewed, you probably get asked questions about celebrities.
[00:25:04] I'm not going to ask you questions about specific celebrities because, you know,
[00:25:07] they're just people like us.
[00:25:09] However, I am curious, is working with celebrities, you know,
[00:25:14] a different experience than a, you know, traditional, you know,
[00:25:19] a buyer seller, do they, do you, are there more masters to serve?
[00:25:24] Are there managers and, and, and agents that also are part of the experience?
[00:25:29] Or are you working more specifically one on one directly with, with the celebrity?
[00:25:33] Yeah, they're definitely not like us.
[00:25:36] They, there was an expectation of where I want to be in my head is,
[00:25:42] is Trump's everything else.
[00:25:44] So you have to cater to that, um, to that personality.
[00:25:48] And just be mindful of the fact that, that any request is,
[00:25:59] is as amazing as it is, you have to cater, you have to cater.
[00:26:03] Sure.
[00:26:03] And with no, with no opinion.
[00:26:08] Yeah, it's, uh, it's definitely, it's, it's a bit hard.
[00:26:13] It's not so sexy.
[00:26:14] Sure.
[00:26:16] Sure.
[00:26:16] It's, it's actually in like, we're talking about celebrity, like,
[00:26:20] fame, like, actor, spain, influencer, that, that kind of thing.
[00:26:25] It's, it's, it's, it's, it's interesting, but it's fun.
[00:26:28] I mean, they're great people and you can, there was a reason why,
[00:26:32] like, when you're around them, like, there were the sum of,
[00:26:34] some of the, they're the presence that they, it's, it's, it's,
[00:26:38] it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's amazing to be around.
[00:26:42] That's fun.
[00:26:43] Um, but it's also hard work, you know?
[00:26:45] Yeah.
[00:26:46] Well, it's you, it's especially with some celebrities that just have that,
[00:26:50] that garner a high price point for, for their acting or, or music services
[00:26:54] or whatever in, in entertainment they're doing is they are getting catered to
[00:26:58] and they have a lot of people surrounding them that are going to help them
[00:27:02] throughout their day.
[00:27:04] And you're right.
[00:27:04] They're probably, you know, and it's not that, that there's anything wrong with this.
[00:27:09] They're just used to being able to get things and having other people do those assignments
[00:27:15] because that's their world.
[00:27:17] And I imagine you having to step into that world is, is, is, is, yeah,
[00:27:21] but probably a, a bit of a challenge initially is like, okay,
[00:27:24] now I'm, I'm part of this team.
[00:27:25] And I get to, to, to do some of the, the, the, the actions that maybe other
[00:27:31] non-slippery's will think to ask.
[00:27:34] I mean, there's some like, like, you mentioned that Damon, when, when we were showing
[00:27:39] property to him, he would have a whole conversation with like the,
[00:27:45] uh, Butler for the maid in the house, like for like, I believe, I was mad he's over there.
[00:27:49] He's like having a 10 minute conversation like, just so, you, you just
[00:27:54] appreciate himself and he's just a guy of gratitude.
[00:27:57] So warm and loving.
[00:27:58] Yeah.
[00:27:59] And the flip side of that, you've clients that are, all of them are really like that.
[00:28:03] But then the day, you know, they look at you as a purpose to make things happen.
[00:28:08] Sure.
[00:28:09] And, um, if they feel like, you know, you're taking advantage or you're,
[00:28:18] you're, you're, you're done.
[00:28:19] Yeah.
[00:28:19] Pretty quickly, you know, because they deal with that all the time.
[00:28:23] People do try to take advantage.
[00:28:24] They do try to, you know, a glum on or, or get something from them.
[00:28:28] And they probably are constantly evaluating, is this person with me because they
[00:28:33] authentically like me as an individual and they want to help me or they want to be
[00:28:36] my friend, or are they with me because I'm, you know, popular and, and, uh,
[00:28:41] and wealth, well to do.
[00:28:42] So yeah, they probably have a very tuned in sense of that.
[00:28:46] And, uh, you being as authentic as you are, probably are, are breath of fresh
[00:28:51] air, uh, for, you know, sometimes when these people might have to meet other,
[00:28:56] uh, I guess I bet they're just constantly evaluating, does this person really want
[00:29:01] to want to help me or are they wanting to help themselves?
[00:29:04] The celebrities like, you know, not, not just like, um, TV personalities, but like
[00:29:09] heads of industry, I consider those in my mind celebrities and I'm, you know, equally
[00:29:15] as like in awe and nervous around, you know, even, you know, after all these years,
[00:29:21] you know, showing Jeff Bezos a house.
[00:29:23] He wasn't my client, but, you know, I showed him a couple of houses and being in his presence
[00:29:28] was pretty cool and the head of, you know, different social networks that, you
[00:29:34] know, when they came around, I was like, okay, this guy like is like the 30th richest
[00:29:41] person in the world, the 10 richest person world of power that they yield is, is,
[00:29:45] is pretty cool, that they're asking, they're looking at me and they're asking me some
[00:29:48] questions that I have to, that are pivotal to his, uh, that, to, to his calculation.
[00:29:54] So that's, that's, that's kind of wild, right?
[00:29:56] Um, well, especially like a Jeff Bezos who's so, so intelligent when it comes to finance
[00:30:03] and business, obviously, right?
[00:30:06] So we, we all know this and I, that would be tremendously intimidating.
[00:30:10] I, I suspect because, but there are things he doesn't know and that's why you're there.
[00:30:15] And obviously for him to look at you is, you know, everything, but like other people, um,
[00:30:23] yeah, I mean, they all know everything, they have everything with their fingertips, but what you're
[00:30:27] bringing to them is, is the opportunity of, uh, or her, the opportunity of properties that
[00:30:34] are not maybe on the market.
[00:30:36] Uh, I'm actually a new agent.
[00:30:38] That's a good way to like, really get in there is by putting in the hard work and finding
[00:30:43] inventory, because that's what our business is all about.
[00:30:45] She's certainly just finding inventory and, um, and, and trying to, and getting contract
[00:30:51] to exclusives to sell inventory and then connecting the dots.
[00:30:56] You, you have a really unique, um, sort of insight into these Titans of industry and you, you know,
[00:31:04] you work with celebrities, but you also work with people who are, you know, in the business world at, at the top of, uh,
[00:31:09] of their respective fields.
[00:31:11] And I suspect over time, you've probably learned a lot as well about,
[00:31:17] uh, either running your own business or just navigating life or doing things more effectively.
[00:31:23] I suspect in addition to obviously being an incredibly effective agent, you've probably just learned
[00:31:28] from these people just being around them and watching them operate.
[00:31:32] Did learn, um, I guess a big lesson that I've learned and I'm, and I've learned over time is to stay,
[00:31:38] to stay super focused on, on, on one, on one bit, one core business to be successful.
[00:31:43] I think that's important, you know, so, um, and I have deviated from that, um, because I'm an entrepreneur, uh, at heart.
[00:31:54] Um, and it's bitten me, you know, um, distracted me, but it has also opened up opportunities to meet other entrepreneurs,
[00:32:03] um, to have those conversations to be able to have those conversations with tech, um, founders and, um,
[00:32:10] and glean from them and understand their business and, and what they're up against and what, and what their stress points are.
[00:32:16] So all that, it's, it's been a, a life I went to basically, I went to, I did my own business school, you know,
[00:32:24] you know, cost me a lot of money, but I went to business school and I paid for it and I learned my, I learned my own,
[00:32:31] you know, my own P&L and how to work that.
[00:32:36] Yeah, I, it, boy, it's so, uh, so interesting that you just, the access you have to these people really helps you, uh, probably sharp in your skills,
[00:32:46] because number one, you have to have sharp, really sharp tools to be able to provide service to these individuals,
[00:32:52] but also they have sharp tools in their own respective fields and you get to sort of see them operate.
[00:32:58] I, I think that wow, what a, what a, what a, what a cool honestly, the best, the coolest part of this business is the fact that I,
[00:33:04] um, when I'm Brad presenting these, these kinds of the industry, um, and I get to hear about what they're doing day to day in the, in the way that they created their legacy,
[00:33:15] it's just so, and it's so wild, it's so cool. It's like, it's like real life chapters are reading, reading these amazing, um, biographies of these people in real life, you know,
[00:33:28] when they tell you what they're doing and then ask them, how did you get there? And the word you start and it's, the stories are so cool, you know, now this podcast all over that, that,
[00:33:38] when you can watch these people do the same thing, but it was, it was, it's great to like, be next to them in real life and you're, instead of going on a million, you're right beside them.
[00:33:48] Um, and that, and that's, and that's pretty cool.
[00:33:51] I love that, that singular focus, uh, suggestion that, that you, you gave is really so important.
[00:33:59] The science and, and, and the data is in, we cannot multitask, whether it's, you know, uh, doing just a little to-do's during the day, or whether it's focusing on our business or whatever projects we're, we're into.
[00:34:12] Yeah, well, I, I, I have ADD, so I'm wondering if the people you've interviewed do a lot of them at, like, the sex successful agent, ADD, almost all of them.
[00:34:24] Right. There you go. So, you know, I'm pretty focused on other questions you're asking me, but as you're talking to me, I'm, as you're talking with me, I'm thinking of like 10, few other things in my head.
[00:34:35] Um, but what that's an aim in me to do is put them down or execute on everything really quickly. So instead of just doing one task, I can't execute a multiple tasks.
[00:34:46] Sure.
[00:34:47] Or at least write them down so I will execute my mind's always.
[00:34:50] Sure.
[00:34:52] So, um, I'm much of a, that's called multitasking.
[00:34:56] So, yeah.
[00:34:57] As long as you're doing it in the same field, you know, you're doing it like all different things, but yeah, I'm, I may, it's, it's interesting how much we're able to execute during the day.
[00:35:07] And I think AI, 100%, I, I use that in my, it streamlines everything. Like I used to, my big part of my success was writing a comparative market analysis for my clients, understand why am I paying 20 million when the highest sale in the neighborhood was 10.
[00:35:23] Right. And I took full comps and do this and then write explanations. So now you can be like you can say an inaudible to five sentences that make somewhat of a sense.
[00:35:35] Some reason AI understands me and they're able to like bone and I can send a message right or or if I have an idea of like why I'm convincing someone of an opportunity or you can, AI will, will help navigate that or where I should be going during the day.
[00:35:50] It's quicker.
[00:35:52] It's, it's helpful to streamline things and make you just go, your time is money, right?
[00:35:59] Yeah, getting your time right. You want to be prospecting. So as much as that is possible.
[00:36:05] Do you have a particular structure to your day and is it, I understand your days probably look wildly different from one another, but in general, do you have a structure that is consistent?
[00:36:17] Yeah, it's, it's working out every five to six days a week in the morning and it's spending time with my dog.
[00:36:27] So he's happy and that gives me some happiness and love. So I do that.
[00:36:34] And then I'm head to the office to follow up with the thousands of people that I have built over the years.
[00:36:43] That's my goal. We're just talking to people all day long because something clicks.
[00:36:48] And then obviously there's there's showings that I have to go to. I'm off. I'm lucky by getting listings and putting on my agents onto being LA one or two to help service the deal so they can open my house for me and get it ready.
[00:37:01] And I show up and I can, I help solve that house. And then I'm back at networking and people are everyone who I pushed out against the, but I mean push out everyone that I reached out to will start texting me back.
[00:37:15] And that's a fault. Talk to all those people. And then it's just ransom repeat. It's very repetitive. It's tedious. But it's consistency and, and I think I know in life when things are monotonous and the same.
[00:37:30] You're actually happier. So the creative industry and every day, no matter how boring it is. And I've done it. Then it's good to, you know, I go to Europe for once a year for three weeks.
[00:37:42] And I detach and then I come back, rejuvenated it and ready to go. But I wasn't doing that for so long for 10 years. I was just working straight. I didn't take any vacations at all.
[00:37:54] Sure. You refused to until I can go first class.
[00:37:57] That's well, hey, that's a great marker. And I think the consistency is it's the fundamentals, right? We're talking fundamentals. We're talking the boring repetitive tasks, the pushups of real estate.
[00:38:12] So to speak that nobody like I don't want to do a wall sit, but it's a really good idea for my legs. And I was doing them yesterday. And I was, you know, it's just in the middle of a wall sit, this isometric exercise that by the end of it, my legs are shaking.
[00:38:28] I just, I just want to collapse. And I go, oh, I only have another five seconds or my trainers telling me I have another five seconds. And I'm like, I can't do another five seconds. And then I, I get to that end. And then I, then I collapse.
[00:38:40] And I think, yeah, well, it's funny because I think this is the least fun thing I could possibly be doing right now.
[00:38:48] The outcome of it means you're going to be more mobile as you get older. Yes. And you'll be able to appreciate enjoy life in your in your later years and your golden age.
[00:39:00] And I'm pushing against resistance, which is good for my mind. It's good for my body. Obviously, good for my muscles. But more important than anything is I'm doing the hard good thing, right? And that's what you are talking about is doing the hard good things that maybe they're not sexy and fun.
[00:39:18] Sometimes they might be, but, but often they're, they're repetitive, they're monotonous. But they work.
[00:39:24] And on top of that, then now to align ourselves to a different triangle of success, we talked about consistency, doing things that are difficult for you, pushing to all that, all that and all that stuff that gets you there. But then you want to align yourself with someone who has done it.
[00:39:48] That's why there's teams. People are so gravitating towards all these teams these days because if you're a new agent or if you're in the business, you're not even new for for five, 10 years, it's good to leverage other people's success and have them in your corner in case you need to lean on them to get that listing.
[00:40:07] And that's a big part of my, my business back in the day when I went for my first listing, I brought in top agents and it was better to get 50% of something to nothing.
[00:40:20] And a lot of big mistake I see new agents here. There's, you know, I've hired agents and I'm like, okay, I can come to the listing with you.
[00:40:28] You just do it often meant or call call, then I see I talked to this guy, I talked to this guy, my great set that meeting up and then they don't.
[00:40:35] And then they, they're, they fail, they're out of the business because they're so like hoarding their chestnuts.
[00:40:43] And what I said at the beginning, it's about sharing, it's about leveraging. So, you know, team up with a top agent like myself, come to my office, I will, I'm your business partner.
[00:40:54] Don't go be a business partner with another new newbie agent because that agent is willing to go door and document you because you don't have the, you don't have it in you to do it.
[00:41:03] Go do it yourself and team up with the top agent was high at a higher level than you.
[00:41:09] Yeah, higher, higher vibrations, higher level to, to get to get those listings because you don't have a resume.
[00:41:16] So, that's important, that's, that's important to do and that's, that's why everyone is, is gravitating towards teams.
[00:41:24] But it becomes a bit of a crutch after a while if you're just doing a team thing for years and years and years.
[00:41:29] But again, that brings me back to like how far do you want to go?
[00:41:32] If you want to be two times better than everybody else, five times, it's ten times, ten times means you're a millionaire, five times means you're going to be making, you'll be breaking even, or you're in life.
[00:41:43] You're in, every day, right? It's going to be a struggle. It depends where you want to be, you know?
[00:41:49] So does that make sense?
[00:41:50] Yeah.
[00:41:51] I did that in my early years, I teamed up big and today you'll look on listings and sometimes I'll have to bring in another top agent because I know I'm competing against, you know, someone who's sold 10th, 8 billion.
[00:42:05] And I need to bring in another guy's done four or three. So it measures up, right?
[00:42:10] So it's about sharing. You know, we don't need all of them. You just want to like get the notches on the belt to have success.
[00:42:17] So you can, you can, more of signs you have out on the street, the more you're going to get hired. It's just visibility, right?
[00:42:24] There's a great agent in Venice Beach.
[00:42:27] And that agent takes all of her listings throughout all of Los Angeles and puts her signs at her. It looks like she monopolizes like the area of like 30 signs everywhere.
[00:42:37] She did some of these signs are like these listings are probably in another state, but it's all about perception, right?
[00:42:45] 
[00:42:45] I even give my Bentley car to my agents to drive go to a listing point. So they want to have, you know, if they don't want me to go on the car with them, they should have me go.
[00:42:54] I let them drive.
[00:42:57] I know I like, whatever it takes, right?
[00:43:01] Yeah, there's a persistency, but this idea of not seeing a finite amount of opportunity, like you don't see finite, you see infinite.
[00:43:13] And you, you're not worried about sharing because there's other opportunities that will come as a result of sharing.
[00:43:20] And the givers get mentality. If I give, I get. And that is obviously served you incredibly well.
[00:43:28] And so much of us want to fix, manage and control the things that are within our purview and nope, nope, I don't want anyone to touch those chestnuts.
[00:43:37] And you're right, it's a mistake.
[00:43:39] Well, I guess it's not a mistake if you're not willing to see the world as infinite.
[00:43:44] If you, if you see the world is there's only a finite amount of resources than, yeah, I guess maybe you should hoard them, but that's not really the pathway to success.
[00:43:52] And, or at least not maybe the best pathway to success.
[00:43:55] So I think you need to do that. And you need to get things in writing because often people are not held to.
[00:44:02] Yeah, you know, everything in writing.
[00:44:04] It's like, yes, even like I am going to go do an open house with you and sit, sit the open house.
[00:44:10] What does it look like if a fire walks through the door?
[00:44:12] Yeah.
[00:44:13] Because in our business, there's so many like nuances like where did that person derive from and who worked the hardest on the deal?
[00:44:22] And when you call list of properties not about like who worked the hardest about getting the listing and being a partnership because you all bring in your strengths here and there.
[00:44:30] But putting things in writing is vital and really smart.
[00:44:35] And you have to do that. Otherwise, you're going to be left with absolutely nothing.
[00:44:41] I put a deal together one of my agents and I was like, we need to get saying in writing and I'm like, no, no, no, this happens so many times.
[00:44:46] I got so pretty much a Europe.
[00:44:48] And we put the deal together. It's a 15 million dollar development deal and we're supposed to get a fee for putting them together.
[00:44:54] They're now together.
[00:44:56] Of course, I'm like, so are we going to get paid? I'm like, guys, I don't think we're going to pay.
[00:45:00] We asked the ask one of them. I'm like, are you going to pay me the fee?
[00:45:04] Yes. But the other person said, no, we're not going to get paid. So we just lost $300,000.
[00:45:09] Just because I didn't do that. Or back in the day, I showed a property in Malibu three times.
[00:45:16] And I said, I said to the agent, we should probably get that single party, single party listing agreement is.
[00:45:22] Sure.
[00:45:23] If you're that one listing, if that one buyer buys it, we get a percentage.
[00:45:27] No, Ben, you know, Mr. David doesn't need to. He's my best friend for 10 years. He would never go around me.
[00:45:36] Well, guess what? Three months later, it's sold for $70 million.
[00:45:40] Oh, that was a $3 million commission. I'm like, oh, so I didn't realize it was going to happen like that.
[00:45:45] I'm just so surprised. He didn't call me. I'm like, do you remember the conversation we had?
[00:45:49] Yeah. You learn these lessons, put things in writing, you know, and that's why you have like an independent contractor agreement, right?
[00:45:56] 
[00:45:56] You get everything you do for putting writing and sign off on things. And then, and then you're going to be, you're going to be in a good way.
[00:46:03] And you won't be what you won't go through arbitration and all the stuff, the stressful stuff that that bothers you, you know.
[00:46:09] We have a lot of our listeners are on the West Coast and obviously we have listeners in everywhere.
[00:46:16] About 95% of our listeners are US. So we have probably listeners in every state. I would hope.
[00:46:23] And so they have clients that may be moving in and out or into, you know, they may be a feeder market into your area.
[00:46:31] And of course, you have clients that move out to other areas, get second homes, you know, other properties.
[00:46:36] So, you know, if one of our listeners says, oh, I might be able to, you know, have a synergy with Ben and his team and might be able to provide value.
[00:46:45] What's the best way somebody should reach out to you if they want to connect with you?
[00:46:50] I think my cell phone is pretty cool. Or my email, Ben, at Rebel Real Estate, let's start there.
[00:46:56] Ben at Rebel Real Estate. Perfect.
[00:46:58] So that's B-E-N and then at Rebel Real Estate.com. Also, if you're in town, when you're in Beverly Hills and that platinum triangle area, we're 9320 B.C.
[00:47:11] And you see a Rebel Real Estate sign, like a 5,000 square feet, the gorgeous office, break by Brodale, and we'll share.
[00:47:18] So I hope to see you with me.
[00:47:20] Yeah.
[00:47:20] I think I'm getting a great coffee. I pride myself on my coffee and very much coffee snob.
[00:47:25] So, time to have a cup of coffee and stop in. I'd love to, or take a stroll down to Beverly or a day and we'll get a coffee together.
[00:47:32] If there's any listeners of ours who are agents in your area and maybe another firm who are really liking what they're hearing and thinking, I want to earn a spot on the Rebel Real Estate team, you know, what's the best way they should go about saying, hey, I have something of value.
[00:47:50] I'm going to say to offer you and how could they reach out as well via email.
[00:47:54] That would be great. Ben at RebelReal Estate.com.
[00:47:57] What do you look for? You have a huge team. What is it? Because I imagine you do not, of course, take everyone who comes your way, probably very selective.
[00:48:05] But what is it that you most look for in an agent?
[00:48:08] I look for someone who is basically everything we're talking about in the sense that they're not scattered and they have one directive and when I ask them things like, where do you think you're going to get your book of business from?
[00:48:26] And they explain like one channel or two channels of what they're going to do. And then I leave them into seeing, are they actually going to execute on that channel?
[00:48:39] I think all the things about that.
[00:48:44] That's okay. It's five.
[00:48:47] We're talking about hyper focus. Yeah, the ability to, like you said, with Titans of industry, the ability to singularly sort of say, I'm doing this thing.
[00:48:58] And if you want to be on board with me while I do this thing, you can, I'm going to do this thing regardless.
[00:49:04] And also, just if it's like a culture fit, you know, if they're just good people and it's someone that like I feel like it's not going to create any any drama in their, in their world that could impact us.
[00:49:19] Just want a positive, positive environment that we could all feel like we can make connections and share inventory with.
[00:49:29] And that kind of thing.
[00:49:33] I'm looking for a culture fit in someone who's go getter motivated and this isn't a part time job. It's a full time job and they have a goal.
[00:49:41] What they want to do.
[00:49:42] Look at you looking to do 10 million this year, 12 million, how are you going to get there?
[00:49:45] And then I let them speak and say and dig your own hole.
[00:49:49] If they're good sensible people that are rational and thoughtful and mindful and have carries an emotional intelligence to and also that they have thick skin because it's a tough business, you know, I'm sure in a role to punches here.
[00:50:06] Right. Don't take anything personally in the beginning, my career, I think so personally, but you know, I learned, I learned many lessons, you know.
[00:50:14] But then also just to be kind and sharing, right. All those all those things.
[00:50:22] That's what I look for, you know, tenacious people. I would love to also, you know, I'm looking at meeting agents that are that are that have done 20, 30 and they're trying to they're 30 million.
[00:50:35] They want to get to 100 million and they're like, why can't I get past this point?
[00:50:40] Sure. I am really good at explaining what you need to do to get there.
[00:50:47] Right. And to create those systems and to direct redirect your focus and bring in other help to get there.
[00:50:55] And I'm an our by company can facilitate that help in order for people to be a rainmaker more every day in their career.
[00:51:05] So those agents that are at 30, they're trying to they're trying to get up or 20 million, they're at 10 million and they can't get past that point.
[00:51:11] I provide coaching myself.
[00:51:15] And if they listen, I provide more coaching. If they execute them, and when I'm telling them I continue because it's, you know, it's going to help my business bring in more more inventory and more sales. Right.

Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.

Best piece of advice you ever received in real estate? Best piece of advice I ever received in real estate is you can find two ultra high net worth clients. and if you can maintain those relationships for your career, that could set the base for you just to take off forever. Yeah, makes sense. Oh, wow. Definitely excited to hear more about that. Worst piece of advice you ever received in real estate? My geographic farm is more than two areas when I started real estate. It would be the worst. Meaning you should have only had one or you should have expanded. No, only had like one. Yeah, we're in Chicago. We have 77 neighborhoods just in the city and you're in L.A. So obviously you have a similar situation there. Pick one of the calls. Is that a dominant right? Yeah, that's right. Ben McCall is my guest today. He is the founder of the Rev.

Ben McCall Estates, we will have links to his website and Instagram in the show notes. Ben, welcome. Thank you for having me. This is cool. It's very cool for me to be able to talk to you because you have a very unique business and a very unique value proposition and it's rarefied air to some degree. I'm doing the show for seven years and I always really love talking to agents that are so highly specialized. I really want to get back to the beginning of the story or get to the beginning of the story so that our listeners can hear how you started and how you ascended in building your business. How did you get into real estate? My mother is a broker in Canada and I watched her in excruciating pain dealing with her clients and I said I want to live a life of an extreme anxiety for the rest of my life. So let me do that for a business like mother likes son. I love that. It is funny but Toronto is a particularly challenging market. People can't sell their houses there. Right. Yes. The bubble has burst. Is your mom still practicing? She's not. That's helped me in my trajectory in my career. Yes. So you moved out to LA when you were 17? Yeah, Toronto. And then tell us how you got involved in real estate. Yeah. I was making movies and going to film school so I wanted to make enough money to buy IP and make short films and videos. And then I just got addicted to my first deal. After doing 30 days grow and working closely with the heads of the family, it was a small deal. I'm sorry, it sounds so grand. But just this family that I was working with in Venice Beach, it was so cool that they entrusted me with this $1.4 million deal in Venice. It was like, wow, this is cool. I'm 25 years old and I just closed their sale and they're so happy and I got them another property. And that felt really, really, and powerful so that the whole process from putting it out there and marketing and negotiations was exciting. So I was like, okay, I'm going to stop. In the entertainment business, I like. I love homes and I love people and. Yeah, that's how it happened. I was door knocking in Venice Beach. So my, my, my mother being the agent, she goes, bad, you need to focus on just the low end of the real estate market. This was just right after the, you know, the bubble burst here in 2008. Right. And my first year real estate, I made about, I made $394,000 in my first year. Amazing. Which I didn't realize how that it was amazing until I own a brokerage and have, you know, 65 agents and realize how, you know, determined you want has to be in order to be here at your top, right. So I didn't give up. I didn't let my head hit the pillow every night until I probably talked to, you know, dozens of people and asked hundreds of people during the week if they wanted to sell their home. And make not thousands. Wow. So you were, you were literally prospecting just nonstop. Just nonstop. And I was just like, I got to see who I can't stop door knocking or call calling until someone says yes that day. And then I would, and then I would go home and be like, okay. And then I would be dreaming about the people I'm talking about thinking who I, who have to call next to follow up with. And back then there wasn't really any CRM systems. I'm like, that was that long ago, 2005 or there was there was like high rise that I used. And they were not that intuitive. Definitely know, no, AI at that point, no, no machine learning in large language models to like help me, you know, direct my focus on to different people. But I would lose a lot of deals like every, every week I go in that must make all my forgot to look at listed on no e did like a list of all Millwood I knocked on that door. I talked to that person. And it was like I was beat, it was always beating myself up because I probably could have made a million dollars that first year. I just followed up and has like a proper proper systems in place. And it's amazing. It's like, you know, you, as you think back, it's like I shot for the, what is the expression I shot for the sun I landed on the moon. You know, it's like you still landed pretty, pretty, pretty far out there like you still had a great year. But as you look back, you go, oh, there were a lot of inconsistencies that I could have done even better. I want to talk about door knocking for a moment because everyone who's listening who is never doorked probably cringes at the thought of a doork. And you know, how did you, was that something that was easy for you and curious to know like what your approach was there. Well, you know, it's all about your approach. Like he said, it's all about your intention. So I often went out with intention of a client that I was actually genuinely looking for. So it came from a place of authenticity. And also was very conversational. So I'll like take out my agents that I recruit that come to the office, even if they've done 50, you know, $100 million or maybe they've done 10 or 20. They, I talk about, I talk about doork knocking they go, will you go doork knocking with me? And I'm like, you guess what I was like, yeah, I'll come doork knocking with you if you promise to go five more times without me and talk to 20 people a day. So it's the approach is I go out and I'm calm. It's more conversational. You know, I walk by a door. I saw see it all. It looked pretty house and unlock. I'm like, hey, just one let you know. My client was looking in your neighbor, your house is so gorgeous. Oh, thank you so much. Yeah. Like, yeah, it's, how long have you lived here for? Whatever a couple of years, I'm like, listen, I know maybe probably don't want to, but if you ever want to sell, I've got a great buyer. You totally, you love your house. I'd love to do. And then they'll be like, well, thank you. We're staying here. We're leaving feet first. I'm like, okay, no problem. If you have any, any friends or, you know, family that want to move in the neighborhood, I have a lot of off market deals and they be able to get your number. And then I'll put my phone out and I'll say, what's your number? And I'll say it out loud. That way they actually give me the number because most of the time they'll say, leave your card. Sure. In the mailbox. But it's more, you know, I honestly say with me smiling and matching, mirroring. Sure. How they're reacting to me will create an instant rapport and a trust that will hopefully cultivate into a phone number, a contact, an email, follow up. And then they become my, you know, my friend and I provide them value over the years and I just, you know, either I provide the value by bringing them up the buyer. If they want to make money or if they're not ready, you just want to create a relationship. Sure. And not be a pushy salesman. So I think I attribute a lot of that door knocking success. I wasn't too salesy and I direct to the point that was actually confident. Even in my early days of what my intention was and what my what I wanted to accomplish in it and it came off as as as important to listen to me what I had to say to these people. It's the last one is there's a day when there wasn't rings anymore. So the ring camera doesn't help too much. That's true. Yeah, it probably makes it a little, a little bit more challenging. But what is I want to sort of unpack this a little bit and because I've done 700 of these episodes over the last seven years. You're the you might be while my memory is terrible. So you might not be the first person that I've ever interviewed for door knocking. But let's say you are because I think you actually are. And I do want to talk about this because it is an absolute no go for so many people to even consider. And the way that you described it by the way what I anticipated you saying before we got to door knocking was well, yeah, I worked in the entertainment industry. I was behind the scenes. I was you know with all these production companies and I just kind of leveraged that network to build by business. And you did not say that you said, oh, I went out and knocked on strangers doors. And I was like, oh my god, how did you do that? And the way that you just explained it made all the sense in the world because it really is kind of a low stakes situation. You're not asking for a sale. You're not selling a product or even a service. You're literally saying, oh, my I have somebody that is looking in this neighborhood or I just help somebody in this neighborhood. I need more homes like yours. So when you are ready, please call me. And it's kind of an easy yes. There's not really any commitment they're giving other than wow, this person just flattered my property and gave me a nice compliment. And also, you're a super nice person. So that also I don't quite understand the apprehension with getting out there because especially if you live in sunny California, you have no excuse. Most of us sitting at their computer hurting their back all day, you can get out there and feel the sun, get some vitamin D and go talk to 20 random people. And it doesn't have to be so like door to door to door to door. You can just sure how's that you like. I listen, I doorknucked and then I elevated my game. And I cut my teeth on more expensive properties. That's also another problem. People are so eager to get into the luxury. They see like these high flying ticket items being sold for 20, 30, 40. I want to go there. It took me like five years to start selling my first six million dollar home. Some people, there's been anomalies that have like gone right to the top and sold 10, 20 million dollars within two years. But it took me a minute. But I built my database. So for instance, I doorknucked in, I guess it was probably like 2010. And that house was owned by a surgeon medium logo. And I stayed in touch with them. And I called them, you know, every year to see if I could bring a buyer. He ended up selling the property to a basketball star. So I missed it on that sale. But I kept on calling and guess what? I sold that home last year for $150 million. Amazing. All because I doorknucked and met that relationship and stayed in touch. And yeah, you know, that's how that's that. You know, but there's another part of that equation. It's your social etiquette and your emotional maturity. Yes. And if either you had that or you don't, you know how to communicate with people. And it's not a high pressure situation. Just the way you talk to people. My dad's a psycho man, a psycho from a family. I guess I'm blessed in that sense that I'm fortunate to have grown up in, you know, a middle class family in Canada. And I'm surrounded myself with other highly intelligent people that had common sense. And courtesy and decency in the world and appreciated, you know, what it is to what it is to have emotions and be cognizant of other people's feelings and, and let people be heard instead of talking at them. So it's that like, you know, it's how people want to communicate. And that's why I don't think, you know, A.I. is not going to take this whole business away. Because people want that emotional connection. And that's what REALTORS give. And they're able to really, it's a huge at stake business. You know, it's a huge, you know, it's your, it's often 30, 40% of people's in that work. So they want to be able to talk to somebody, right? Absolutely. And I also, again, I'm just, I'm going back to the, this approach of the cold open, which is essentially what you're doing. And what you're doing is it's, it's a very smart play because it is, for example, I live in a condo building. So it would be harder for somebody to do this for me. In fact, we'd have a security issue if somebody was able to knock on my door. But the idea of maybe receiving a letter in the mail or phone call, possibly, I'm sure I'm sure my phone number's out there. And I don't think everybody knows that I have a real estate license. I don't use my license. So the irony is I don't even use my license. But I don't think that's not the reason I'm not getting calls. I don't think that's the reason I'm not getting calls. And I suspect, you know, it would be very flattering if somebody said, hey, I know you moved in five years ago. Yeah. And you're, I don't know what your life situation is. It's a buyer, real family. We have to. Yeah. Or just. I love that way. That is a, is that letter thing you've seen the, the kernel of the idea. That's a former prospecting. Sure. If you're not door knocking in every day, then you're calling that a letter. You can write a letter and you can be very specific about who that, that person is, right? That personification of that family. Yeah. What seems so is real. And you could say my client's looking for this kind of property, which is your property and your address, handwritten. Yeah. If you put in that work and handwrite letters, that's what your, your risk is going to be hurting by the end of the day. 100. We're feet are going to be pain and pain from door knocking. You're going to be tired. You can, you can, you can put more sunscreen on. You're, you're thirsty. You need to go to the bathroom. Your, your through throat is tired. You're like done with the rejection. That's when you know you're going to be successful. Yeah. And if you're not 10 times better than anyone out there in this business. Yeah. Then this is, this is a part time game. And that's okay. Maybe people just, you know, they want to, you know, you want to live a life of uncertainty and, you know, you want to build wealth, wealth, generation, no wealth. Then that's where you want to be. But if you want to be at the top of your game, you got to be, you have to be 10 times better than everyone else. And, and there's very few people. That's why they say 90% of the business is done by what? 10% at the top, right? Because they just, they, they work their tail off, you know, they're consistent. Yeah, they do. I've interviewed some of the very top agents in, in the world, including your, now, now adding you to the list as well. And I've been doing that for years and, and I do ask like, what's your secret? And usually it's, I just, I work people, you know, I'm not, I'm not necessarily, you're, you got to be, you know, you're going to give the gap, be relatable, be a kind person, smile, be confident, understand your market, know the values and talk to 20 people today. And follow up with them. Yeah. That's it. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's as simple as that. And then you have to like get out there and make connections. And if you build a good reputation, and other agents respect you, that is, and then you can, you'll sell a lot of property that is not on the open market. So you can, you can, you can, you can match, you know, people to properties and, and you can do that at any price point. So that's, that's also vital, I think, relationships, building relationships. And, and I think that one of my sellers who was a broke, sorry, one of my, what am I, what am I sellers? One of my buyers, he's a buyer and seller. So he taught me an important lesson. He said, you know, bend this business is about sharing, right? You want to share. So, you know, if I, if someone, if I mean interviewed for a listing that expired, that's, you know, maybe, you know, that's fair game. But if you want to work with everyone in your community as agents, they're, they're your life run, right? And then the buyers and sellers will come, but you want to, you really want to work closely with other agents. And you want to be sharing with them. You know, my company revel, if I see an agent come in, and he is everything that we're talking about, he or she, and they're putting in the effort and they put in the work and they're, and they're, they're consistent. And I, I will actually put them on my listing and offer them like a service fee, so they can build their repertoire of getting to 10, 20 millenux. So they have a resume. Yeah. I did that myself. I didn't have any. It's very generous. You do that for me. But that's what I do with my company, you know, you'll see if you go to anyone, one of my listings, you'll see me and LA one and LA two, which is in the multiple listing service and all this hand just other, my people in my office, that way they have a resume. So sharing is important. Does that make sense? You know, sharing not, not, not, not, not in that respect, just like in, in the commissions, you know, of course, as a broker, we get in the middle of, you know, the commission just puts within the offices, you know, what is time, who walked through the property and so forth. And that's always something fun to navigate. But, but the idea of you, at least putting them on the official listing as LA one and two, is really a generous thing. I, again, maybe other people I've interviewed do that. I've never heard anybody say they do it with basically every listing, especially for, you know, more junior agents. I, I can't imagine what that must do to some, the loyalty. These agents must have for, for revel and, and you know, people know this, but if they look at them, alas, they can see, they can see that I do that. But about, but you know, you have to be with me for a certain amount, you know, sure, of course, to gain, to gain that trust or, or if I actually see that you're a go getter, right? That, you know, you're a go getter and you're making that happen and you're closing sales. That's much more important, right? Because if you're not closing, then you pretty much know they're, if they're putting in that, that 110% right? Absolutely. I'm sure when you get interviewed, you probably get asked questions about celebrities. I'm not going to ask you questions about specific celebrities because, you know, they're just people like us. However, I am curious, is working with celebrities, you know, a different experience than a, you know, traditional, you know, a buyer seller, do they, do you, are there more masters to serve? Are there managers and, and, and agents that also are part of the experience? Or are you working more specifically one on one directly with, with the celebrity? Yeah, they're definitely not like us. They, there was an expectation of where I want to be in my head is, is Trump's everything else. So you have to cater to that, um, to that personality. And just be mindful of the fact that, that any request is, is as amazing as it is, you have to cater, you have to cater. Sure. And with no, with no opinion. Yeah, it's, uh, it's definitely, it's, it's a bit hard. It's not so sexy. Sure. Sure. It's, it's actually in like, we're talking about celebrity, like, fame, like, actor, spain, influencer, that, that kind of thing. It's, it's, it's, it's, it's interesting, but it's fun. I mean, they're great people and you can, there was a reason why, like, when you're around them, like, there were the sum of, some of the, they're the presence that they, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's, it's amazing to be around. That's fun. Um, but it's also hard work, you know? Yeah. Well, it's you, it's especially with some celebrities that just have that, that garner a high price point for, for their acting or, or music services or whatever in, in entertainment they're doing is they are getting catered to and they have a lot of people surrounding them that are going to help them throughout their day. And you're right. They're probably, you know, and it's not that, that there's anything wrong with this. They're just used to being able to get things and having other people do those assignments because that's their world. And I imagine you having to step into that world is, is, is, is, yeah, but probably a, a bit of a challenge initially is like, okay, now I'm, I'm part of this team. And I get to, to, to do some of the, the, the, the actions that maybe other non-slippery's will think to ask. I mean, there's some like, like, you mentioned that Damon, when, when we were showing property to him, he would have a whole conversation with like the, uh, Butler for the maid in the house, like for like, I believe, I was mad he's over there. He's like having a 10 minute conversation like, just so, you, you just appreciate himself and he's just a guy of gratitude. So warm and loving. Yeah. And the flip side of that, you've clients that are, all of them are really like that. But then the day, you know, they look at you as a purpose to make things happen. Sure. And, um, if they feel like, you know, you're taking advantage or you're, you're, you're, you're done. Yeah. Pretty quickly, you know, because they deal with that all the time. People do try to take advantage. They do try to, you know, a glum on or, or get something from them. And they probably are constantly evaluating, is this person with me because they authentically like me as an individual and they want to help me or they want to be my friend, or are they with me because I'm, you know, popular and, and, uh, and wealth, well to do. So yeah, they probably have a very tuned in sense of that. And, uh, you being as authentic as you are, probably are, are breath of fresh air, uh, for, you know, sometimes when these people might have to meet other, uh, I guess I bet they're just constantly evaluating, does this person really want to want to help me or are they wanting to help themselves? The celebrities like, you know, not, not just like, um, TV personalities, but like heads of industry, I consider those in my mind celebrities and I'm, you know, equally as like in awe and nervous around, you know, even, you know, after all these years, you know, showing Jeff Bezos a house. He wasn't my client, but, you know, I showed him a couple of houses and being in his presence was pretty cool and the head of, you know, different social networks that, you know, when they came around, I was like, okay, this guy like is like the 30th richest person in the world, the 10 richest person world of power that they yield is, is, is pretty cool, that they're asking, they're looking at me and they're asking me some questions that I have to, that are pivotal to his, uh, that, to, to his calculation. So that's, that's, that's kind of wild, right? Um, well, especially like a Jeff Bezos who's so, so intelligent when it comes to finance and business, obviously, right? So we, we all know this and I, that would be tremendously intimidating. I, I suspect because, but there are things he doesn't know and that's why you're there. And obviously for him to look at you is, you know, everything, but like other people, um, yeah, I mean, they all know everything, they have everything with their fingertips, but what you're bringing to them is, is the opportunity of, uh, or her, the opportunity of properties that are not maybe on the market. Uh, I'm actually a new agent. That's a good way to like, really get in there is by putting in the hard work and finding inventory, because that's what our business is all about. She's certainly just finding inventory and, um, and, and trying to, and getting contract to exclusives to sell inventory and then connecting the dots. You, you have a really unique, um, sort of insight into these Titans of industry and you, you know, you work with celebrities, but you also work with people who are, you know, in the business world at, at the top of, uh, of their respective fields. And I suspect over time, you've probably learned a lot as well about, uh, either running your own business or just navigating life or doing things more effectively. I suspect in addition to obviously being an incredibly effective agent, you've probably just learned from these people just being around them and watching them operate. Did learn, um, I guess a big lesson that I've learned and I'm, and I've learned over time is to stay, to stay super focused on, on, on one, on one bit, one core business to be successful. I think that's important, you know, so, um, and I have deviated from that, um, because I'm an entrepreneur, uh, at heart. Um, and it's bitten me, you know, um, distracted me, but it has also opened up opportunities to meet other entrepreneurs, um, to have those conversations to be able to have those conversations with tech, um, founders and, um, and glean from them and understand their business and, and what they're up against and what, and what their stress points are. So all that, it's, it's been a, a life I went to basically, I went to, I did my own business school, you know, you know, cost me a lot of money, but I went to business school and I paid for it and I learned my, I learned my own, you know, my own P&L and how to work that. Yeah, I, it, boy, it's so, uh, so interesting that you just, the access you have to these people really helps you, uh, probably sharp in your skills, because number one, you have to have sharp, really sharp tools to be able to provide service to these individuals, but also they have sharp tools in their own respective fields and you get to sort of see them operate. I, I think that wow, what a, what a, what a, what a cool honestly, the best, the coolest part of this business is the fact that I, um, when I'm Brad presenting these, these kinds of the industry, um, and I get to hear about what they're doing day to day in the, in the way that they created their legacy, it's just so, and it's so wild, it's so cool. It's like, it's like real life chapters are reading, reading these amazing, um, biographies of these people in real life, you know, when they tell you what they're doing and then ask them, how did you get there? And the word you start and it's, the stories are so cool, you know, now this podcast all over that, that, when you can watch these people do the same thing, but it was, it was, it's great to like, be next to them in real life and you're, instead of going on a million, you're right beside them. Um, and that, and that's, and that's pretty cool. I love that, that singular focus, uh, suggestion that, that you, you gave is really so important. The science and, and, and the data is in, we cannot multitask, whether it's, you know, uh, doing just a little to-do's during the day, or whether it's focusing on our business or whatever projects we're, we're into. Yeah, well, I, I, I have ADD, so I'm wondering if the people you've interviewed do a lot of them at, like, the sex successful agent, ADD, almost all of them. Right. There you go. So, you know, I'm pretty focused on other questions you're asking me, but as you're talking to me, I'm, as you're talking with me, I'm thinking of like 10, few other things in my head. Um, but what that's an aim in me to do is put them down or execute on everything really quickly. So instead of just doing one task, I can't execute a multiple tasks. Sure. Or at least write them down so I will execute my mind's always. Sure. So, um, I'm much of a, that's called multitasking. So, yeah. As long as you're doing it in the same field, you know, you're doing it like all different things, but yeah, I'm, I may, it's, it's interesting how much we're able to execute during the day. And I think AI, 100%, I, I use that in my, it streamlines everything. Like I used to, my big part of my success was writing a comparative market analysis for my clients, understand why am I paying 20 million when the highest sale in the neighborhood was 10. Right. And I took full comps and do this and then write explanations. So now you can be like you can say an inaudible to five sentences that make somewhat of a sense. Some reason AI understands me and they're able to like bone and I can send a message right or or if I have an idea of like why I'm convincing someone of an opportunity or you can, AI will, will help navigate that or where I should be going during the day. It's quicker. It's, it's helpful to streamline things and make you just go, your time is money, right? Yeah, getting your time right. You want to be prospecting. So as much as that is possible. Do you have a particular structure to your day and is it, I understand your days probably look wildly different from one another, but in general, do you have a structure that is consistent? Yeah, it's, it's working out every five to six days a week in the morning and it's spending time with my dog. So he's happy and that gives me some happiness and love. So I do that. And then I'm head to the office to follow up with the thousands of people that I have built over the years. That's my goal. We're just talking to people all day long because something clicks. And then obviously there's there's showings that I have to go to. I'm off. I'm lucky by getting listings and putting on my agents onto being LA one or two to help service the deal so they can open my house for me and get it ready. And I show up and I can, I help solve that house. And then I'm back at networking and people are everyone who I pushed out against the, but I mean push out everyone that I reached out to will start texting me back. And that's a fault. Talk to all those people. And then it's just ransom repeat. It's very repetitive. It's tedious. But it's consistency and, and I think I know in life when things are monotonous and the same. You're actually happier. So the creative industry and every day, no matter how boring it is. And I've done it. Then it's good to, you know, I go to Europe for once a year for three weeks. And I detach and then I come back, rejuvenated it and ready to go. But I wasn't doing that for so long for 10 years. I was just working straight. I didn't take any vacations at all. Sure. You refused to until I can go first class. That's well, hey, that's a great marker. And I think the consistency is it's the fundamentals, right? We're talking fundamentals. We're talking the boring repetitive tasks, the pushups of real estate. So to speak that nobody like I don't want to do a wall sit, but it's a really good idea for my legs. And I was doing them yesterday. And I was, you know, it's just in the middle of a wall sit, this isometric exercise that by the end of it, my legs are shaking. I just, I just want to collapse. And I go, oh, I only have another five seconds or my trainers telling me I have another five seconds. And I'm like, I can't do another five seconds. And then I, I get to that end. And then I, then I collapse. And I think, yeah, well, it's funny because I think this is the least fun thing I could possibly be doing right now. The outcome of it means you're going to be more mobile as you get older. Yes. And you'll be able to appreciate enjoy life in your in your later years and your golden age. And I'm pushing against resistance, which is good for my mind. It's good for my body. Obviously, good for my muscles. But more important than anything is I'm doing the hard good thing, right? And that's what you are talking about is doing the hard good things that maybe they're not sexy and fun. Sometimes they might be, but, but often they're, they're repetitive, they're monotonous. But they work. And on top of that, then now to align ourselves to a different triangle of success, we talked about consistency, doing things that are difficult for you, pushing to all that, all that and all that stuff that gets you there. But then you want to align yourself with someone who has done it. That's why there's teams. People are so gravitating towards all these teams these days because if you're a new agent or if you're in the business, you're not even new for for five, 10 years, it's good to leverage other people's success and have them in your corner in case you need to lean on them to get that listing. And that's a big part of my, my business back in the day when I went for my first listing, I brought in top agents and it was better to get 50% of something to nothing. And a lot of big mistake I see new agents here. There's, you know, I've hired agents and I'm like, okay, I can come to the listing with you. You just do it often meant or call call, then I see I talked to this guy, I talked to this guy, my great set that meeting up and then they don't. And then they, they're, they fail, they're out of the business because they're so like hoarding their chestnuts. And what I said at the beginning, it's about sharing, it's about leveraging. So, you know, team up with a top agent like myself, come to my office, I will, I'm your business partner. Don't go be a business partner with another new newbie agent because that agent is willing to go door and document you because you don't have the, you don't have it in you to do it. Go do it yourself and team up with the top agent was high at a higher level than you. Yeah, higher, higher vibrations, higher level to, to get to get those listings because you don't have a resume. So, that's important, that's, that's important to do and that's, that's why everyone is, is gravitating towards teams. But it becomes a bit of a crutch after a while if you're just doing a team thing for years and years and years. But again, that brings me back to like how far do you want to go? If you want to be two times better than everybody else, five times, it's ten times, ten times means you're a millionaire, five times means you're going to be making, you'll be breaking even, or you're in life. You're in, every day, right? It's going to be a struggle. It depends where you want to be, you know? So does that make sense? Yeah. I did that in my early years, I teamed up big and today you'll look on listings and sometimes I'll have to bring in another top agent because I know I'm competing against, you know, someone who's sold 10th, 8 billion. And I need to bring in another guy's done four or three. So it measures up, right? So it's about sharing. You know, we don't need all of them. You just want to like get the notches on the belt to have success. So you can, you can, more of signs you have out on the street, the more you're going to get hired. It's just visibility, right? There's a great agent in Venice Beach. And that agent takes all of her listings throughout all of Los Angeles and puts her signs at her. It looks like she monopolizes like the area of like 30 signs everywhere. She did some of these signs are like these listings are probably in another state, but it's all about perception, right? I even give my Bentley car to my agents to drive go to a listing point. So they want to have, you know, if they don't want me to go on the car with them, they should have me go. I let them drive. I know I like, whatever it takes, right? Yeah, there's a persistency, but this idea of not seeing a finite amount of opportunity, like you don't see finite, you see infinite. And you, you're not worried about sharing because there's other opportunities that will come as a result of sharing. And the givers get mentality. If I give, I get. And that is obviously served you incredibly well. And so much of us want to fix, manage and control the things that are within our purview and nope, nope, I don't want anyone to touch those chestnuts. And you're right, it's a mistake. Well, I guess it's not a mistake if you're not willing to see the world as infinite. If you, if you see the world is there's only a finite amount of resources than, yeah, I guess maybe you should hoard them, but that's not really the pathway to success. And, or at least not maybe the best pathway to success. So I think you need to do that. And you need to get things in writing because often people are not held to. Yeah, you know, everything in writing. It's like, yes, even like I am going to go do an open house with you and sit, sit the open house. What does it look like if a fire walks through the door? Yeah. Because in our business, there's so many like nuances like where did that person derive from and who worked the hardest on the deal? And when you call list of properties not about like who worked the hardest about getting the listing and being a partnership because you all bring in your strengths here and there. But putting things in writing is vital and really smart. And you have to do that. Otherwise, you're going to be left with absolutely nothing. I put a deal together one of my agents and I was like, we need to get saying in writing and I'm like, no, no, no, this happens so many times. I got so pretty much a Europe. And we put the deal together. It's a 15 million dollar development deal and we're supposed to get a fee for putting them together. They're now together. Of course, I'm like, so are we going to get paid? I'm like, guys, I don't think we're going to pay. We asked the ask one of them. I'm like, are you going to pay me the fee? Yes. But the other person said, no, we're not going to get paid. So we just lost $300,000. Just because I didn't do that. Or back in the day, I showed a property in Malibu three times. And I said, I said to the agent, we should probably get that single party, single party listing agreement is. Sure. If you're that one listing, if that one buyer buys it, we get a percentage. No, Ben, you know, Mr. David doesn't need to. He's my best friend for 10 years. He would never go around me. Well, guess what? Three months later, it's sold for $70 million. Oh, that was a $3 million commission. I'm like, oh, so I didn't realize it was going to happen like that. I'm just so surprised. He didn't call me. I'm like, do you remember the conversation we had? Yeah. You learn these lessons, put things in writing, you know, and that's why you have like an independent contractor agreement, right? You get everything you do for putting writing and sign off on things. And then, and then you're going to be, you're going to be in a good way. And you won't be what you won't go through arbitration and all the stuff, the stressful stuff that that bothers you, you know. We have a lot of our listeners are on the West Coast and obviously we have listeners in everywhere. About 95% of our listeners are US. So we have probably listeners in every state. I would hope. And so they have clients that may be moving in and out or into, you know, they may be a feeder market into your area. And of course, you have clients that move out to other areas, get second homes, you know, other properties. So, you know, if one of our listeners says, oh, I might be able to, you know, have a synergy with Ben and his team and might be able to provide value. What's the best way somebody should reach out to you if they want to connect with you? I think my cell phone is pretty cool. Or my email, Ben, at Rebel Real Estate, let's start there. Ben at Rebel Real Estate. Perfect. So that's B-E-N and then at Rebel Real Estate.com. Also, if you're in town, when you're in Beverly Hills and that platinum triangle area, we're 9320 B.C. And you see a Rebel Real Estate sign, like a 5,000 square feet, the gorgeous office, break by Brodale, and we'll share. So I hope to see you with me. Yeah. I think I'm getting a great coffee. I pride myself on my coffee and very much coffee snob. So, time to have a cup of coffee and stop in. I'd love to, or take a stroll down to Beverly or a day and we'll get a coffee together. If there's any listeners of ours who are agents in your area and maybe another firm who are really liking what they're hearing and thinking, I want to earn a spot on the Rebel Real Estate team, you know, what's the best way they should go about saying, hey, I have something of value. I'm going to say to offer you and how could they reach out as well via email. That would be great. Ben at RebelReal Estate.com. What do you look for? You have a huge team. What is it? Because I imagine you do not, of course, take everyone who comes your way, probably very selective. But what is it that you most look for in an agent? I look for someone who is basically everything we're talking about in the sense that they're not scattered and they have one directive and when I ask them things like, where do you think you're going to get your book of business from? And they explain like one channel or two channels of what they're going to do. And then I leave them into seeing, are they actually going to execute on that channel? I think all the things about that. That's okay. It's five. We're talking about hyper focus. Yeah, the ability to, like you said, with Titans of industry, the ability to singularly sort of say, I'm doing this thing. And if you want to be on board with me while I do this thing, you can, I'm going to do this thing regardless. And also, just if it's like a culture fit, you know, if they're just good people and it's someone that like I feel like it's not going to create any any drama in their, in their world that could impact us. Just want a positive, positive environment that we could all feel like we can make connections and share inventory with. And that kind of thing. I'm looking for a culture fit in someone who's go getter motivated and this isn't a part time job. It's a full time job and they have a goal. What they want to do. Look at you looking to do 10 million this year, 12 million, how are you going to get there? And then I let them speak and say and dig your own hole. If they're good sensible people that are rational and thoughtful and mindful and have carries an emotional intelligence to and also that they have thick skin because it's a tough business, you know, I'm sure in a role to punches here. Right. Don't take anything personally in the beginning, my career, I think so personally, but you know, I learned, I learned many lessons, you know. But then also just to be kind and sharing, right. All those all those things. That's what I look for, you know, tenacious people. I would love to also, you know, I'm looking at meeting agents that are that are that have done 20, 30 and they're trying to they're 30 million. They want to get to 100 million and they're like, why can't I get past this point? Sure. I am really good at explaining what you need to do to get there. Right. And to create those systems and to direct redirect your focus and bring in other help to get there. And I'm an our by company can facilitate that help in order for people to be a rainmaker more every day in their career. So those agents that are at 30, they're trying to they're trying to get up or 20 million, they're at 10 million and they can't get past that point. I provide coaching myself. And if they listen, I provide more coaching. If they execute them, and when I'm telling them I continue because it's, you know, it's going to help my business bring in more more inventory and more sales. Right. I love it.
