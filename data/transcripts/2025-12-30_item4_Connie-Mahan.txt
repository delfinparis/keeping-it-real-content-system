[00:01:23] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage, your team?
[00:01:27] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:31] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:34] So how do you know who to contact?

[00:02:58] Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and four real estate agents.
[00:03:04] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:03:06] I'm your guide and host through the show in just a moment.
[00:03:08] We're going to be speaking with Connie Mayhan.
[00:03:10] But before we get to Connie, she's a top producer.
[00:03:13] We want to say thank you for an amazing 2025.
[00:03:17] This has been a fun year.
[00:03:19] We've done a ton of episodes and gotten so much great feedback.
[00:03:22] And we have the most listeners we've ever had.
[00:03:24] So I wanted to say thank you to everybody for telling a friend about this show.
[00:03:28] Please continue to do so if there's other agents in your office that want to hear from top producers.
[00:03:32] Let them know about us.
[00:03:33] We really appreciate you.
[00:03:35] And also I built a tool that I'd like you to check out.

[00:03:58] And I want you to have the very coolest best and most exciting listing descriptions in your market so that you can take your market even higher.
[00:04:06] And you can take more market share from others that isn't would that be great.
[00:04:10] All right, so let's get on to it and we're going to have a great next year.
[00:04:14] We have a lot more stuff planned.
[00:04:15] We have some new exciting types of episodes we're going to do.
[00:04:18] We'll keep you in the loop on that.
[00:04:19] But for now, let's just get right onto my conversation with Connie Mayhan.
[00:04:38] As to advice you perceived in real estate.
[00:04:40] That's easy.
[00:04:42] The best advice I received was from my very first broker.
[00:04:46] When I got into real estate, I was not from here.
[00:04:49] I did not obviously go to school here and I didn't go to church with anybody.
[00:04:53] I didn't know anyone.
[00:04:53] I didn't know the roads.
[00:04:55] And we have a local paper.
[00:04:57] It's what's called the Sumter Shopper back then and it had a calendar of events.
[00:05:01] And she handed me the paper and she said, I want you to go to every single one of these events, every single one of these things every week.
[00:05:08] She's like, and sign up to do something.
[00:05:10] So it was like, Kiwanis Club, Rotary Club, Relay for Life, the local chamber.
[00:05:15] And, you know, I just signed up for something and I just showed up every week or every month, I should say, but every it was every week because there was a different one going on every week.
[00:05:24] And, you know, back then my broker's name is Mickey Blackburn.
[00:05:27] It was Connie Mayhan with Mickey Blackburn Realty for 10 years.
[00:05:31] But the best advice was literally to get in and do and the rest will figure itself out.
[00:05:37] And to come back to her too, I did like take notes because we didn't have phones.
[00:05:41] I'm going to like take a selfie, right?
[00:05:42] So I did like take notes and be like, look, I served coffee, right?
[00:05:45] Or I send up for sponsorship.
[00:05:48] I love it.
[00:05:50] Worst advice you've received in real estate.
[00:05:52] Worst advice and I use a portion of this now.
[00:05:56] So no offense to anybody.
[00:05:58] But at the time when it was given to me, the worst advice was to go all in on buying leads.
[00:06:04] And we went, I would say it's probably around 2014 and we went big.
[00:06:09] We didn't just do a zip code or two.
[00:06:11] We bought all the zip codes.
[00:06:13] Because we also really didn't know what that was going to mean.
[00:06:15] And the volume of business was incredible.
[00:06:19] But it was just there was zero time for relationship making zero.
[00:06:23] It was just on my, I mean, we made a bucket of money.
[00:06:26] We spent a bucket of money.
[00:06:28] But yeah, buying leads as a broker now, it's, I definitely, you know, try to teach my agents a different model.
[00:06:34] But we went all in and I probably can't remember one name of who I sold a house to that year.
[00:06:39] Yeah. Yeah, more transactional.
[00:06:41] I designed, but just by the fact of the sheer volume of leads up that we're coming in.
[00:06:49] I certainly understand, understand that.
[00:06:52] And yeah, working by referral seems to be the name of the game.
[00:06:57] Connie Mayhan is our guest today.
[00:06:59] I want to tell you about her.
[00:07:00] She is an exceptional REALTOR in Florida.
[00:07:03] She's the broker owner of the Connie Mayhan real estate group, which is an independent award winning full service brokerage serving central Florida.
[00:07:12] She has been named REALTOR of the year in both Lake and Sumpter counties and recognized as one of the top 10 women to watch in the heart of central Florida.
[00:07:23] Connie is also a, a Riz media newsmaker and has been honored as businesswoman of the year by the Sumpter County Chamber of Commerce with over 2 decades of experience.
[00:07:32] She leads with deep mark knowledge and a reputation for honest guidance that puts long term trust ahead of short term transactions.
[00:07:40] believing real estate leadership extends far beyond the closing table through hands-on volunteering, mentoring agents, and advocating for the customers and communities she serves.
[00:07:51] I want you all to follow her on Facebook. Search for Connie Mayhan that is M-A-H-A and we will have a link to Connie's Facebook. Also her Instagram will put that in there as well. Connie, welcome to the show.
[00:08:05] Thank you. Thank you. It's a pleasure. I appreciate being here.
[00:08:08] You have one of, and for those of you listening, you won't be able to see this, but you have one of the most infectious smiles and energies.
[00:08:16] I've done a lot of these episodes, 700, I believe.
[00:08:20] Wow.
[00:08:21] Boy, your smile is just, I, it's one of, it's my, on my all-time favorite smiles, I get to look at this for another hour. I'm so happy to do this.
[00:08:29] You instantly have made my day brighter, and I suspect you hear that a lot from clients. You have an energy to you that our audience is about to, no pressure by the way to.
[00:08:41] No pressure.
[00:08:42] And, and, and, but it is just kind of your disposition, and I am so excited to learn about you. So tell us a little bit about your journey. How did you start in real estate?
[00:08:54] So it's actually, it has become really kind of one of my favorite stories, because I had no plan of getting into real estate. I didn't know about real estate. I didn't own home.
[00:09:04] I was actually in restaurant management in New Orleans, and had come to Florida to spend some time with my grandmother and in my mom. And then in, in that time frame, I was.
[00:09:15] I was watching dishes at a local restaurant for the breakfast shift and stocking shelves at a warehouse in the afternoon literally was just taking a break from life.
[00:09:25] And a friend of mine, a lady that I knew from the restaurant she wanted to get her real estate license. And at the time, the only class it was being offered was in the town about an hour away on Tuesday and Thursday nights.
[00:09:37] And she wasn't comfortable driving a night because she was older. And she asked me, after my breakfast shift and my afternoon shift, if she could pay me to drive her to real estate school.
[00:09:46] And, and I was like, well, how much does the class cost? And in fact, then it was only 250 bucks. And I said, well, why don't you pay for me to take the class with you and we'll just do it together.
[00:09:54] And that was it. I had a phenomenal teacher that teacher Nina Papis. She had just come to Florida from California. She was a Greek woman, originally in the corporate world was Xerox, but just dominated real estate.
[00:10:08] And she was just super dynamic. And I mean, I was in just it was meant to be. I was just in right away. And obviously I quit the dishwasher job and I quit the shop still shelf stocking job and just went all in.
[00:10:26] Wow. And that is that is a big jump, by the way, to go to go from, you know, more of a more simple task job to now dealing with someone's largest financial transaction is a major lift, right. And that is that's an incredible. I love hearing stories like that.
[00:10:45] What gave you sort of the confidence to move from from eight is you went from a to Z basically.
[00:10:51] Truly. Well, my previous, we'll call it my previous life. So I was in fine dining restaurant management right before. So dealing with people and, you know, expectations and that kind of stuff. I was already very comfortable with that.
[00:11:03] But I think what helped me is there was no social media back then, right. So I had nothing to compare myself to. I just knew that I was going to go out, do a great job, you know, deal honestly and fairly.
[00:11:15] You know, work until the job was done. And I just had the consumers best interest in mine and that was it, you know.
[00:11:24] I'm so glad that you said that. And I, I really appreciate your perspective on social media because it is a comparison game. And we often don't talk about this. And certainly we don't have to get into it too much on this episode.
[00:11:40] But it is something to think about that we, the expression goes something like we compare our insides to someone else's outsides.
[00:11:49] Right. And we see that on Instagram in particular with the perfect filters and everybody looking a certain way. And I know if it was me and I was in high school and we had social media and I wasn't invited to a party.
[00:12:04] Maybe I was about it on Monday. And then I would be like crushed because I wasn't invited. But if I were to see pictures of it on social media, the next Monday, you know, and there's an adult version of this as well.
[00:12:15] And you said something very important because I started as a dishwasher as well. And when I, when I was, when I was a teenager and it didn't occur to me that there was anything like low level about that.
[00:12:28] I just went, well, I'll just be the best dishwasher.
[00:12:30] Absolutely.
[00:12:30] You know, and yeah, and I just kind of thought whatever I do, I want to be good at it. And it doesn't because when you're good at things, people appreciate that and they pay you and you tend to not get fired and maybe even promoted and things like that.
[00:12:48] And I just saw that the people that had the most respect I started in restaurants were the ones that seemed to work the hardest or at least appeared to, you know, just do do the take the job the most most seriously as they could.
[00:13:01] And so I was I'm right with you on that. I think everybody should have a food service job at some point to just understand that is a, that is a, that is a rough job. And you know, we, we, we don't often, you know, give our people in that industry as much respect.
[00:13:29] And you know, it's a good thing to do a good job.
[00:13:40] And so I think it's really good to do a good job as a server. And you know, obviously, that carries over into real estate. So let's talk about that journey.
[00:13:46] So you went, you did kind of a night school situation. You had somebody sort of sponsor you and then, okay, you have your license. And then now it's like, okay, now I have to get clients. So how did that work?
[00:14:00] So actually, I'll back up for one second. First, I had to find a broker. So I interviewed with 11 brokers. And they all said no.
[00:14:12] Yes, they all said no. And then finally, I came across a lady who was an office manager.
[00:14:21] The broker that I ended up working with. And she's an I interviewed with her as, you know, really internally defeated walking in the door.
[00:14:28] But I'm still going to smile. Still going to walk in. We're still going to do this, right. And she said, I think Mickey will like you. And sure enough, I went and at the time.
[00:14:37] And still to this day, you know, she's just definitely a name in real estate in our area. You know, me epic businesswoman. She was a great broker.
[00:14:46] And she took one look at me and she's like, hmm, I think we could figure this out. And that was it. So I had to start there. First was actually even getting hired. And it was funny because that first year, I was fortunate.
[00:14:58] I won rookie of the year. And some of the brokers that I interviewed with are like, huh, but that was a mistake.
[00:15:06] I mean, 11 knows is first of all, you're like, I assume you have the same disposition today as you did then. I mean, I don't know. Maybe it's changed a little. I don't, but I suspect you're the same person you've always been.
[00:15:20] And you're the most kind of love. Like you are just an easy person to be around. I am shocked that anyone would say to you, I am a recruiter. I recruit REALTORS. I would love to have you if I was a Florida REALTOR. I'd be like, I'll over. I got to get caught. I'm here.
[00:15:38] So I am, I'm shocked to hear that. But what a wonderful thing to be able to persevere and God, that would decimate my courage. And the fact is it certainly didn't decimate yours. And you got into it. So how did you find clients right away?
[00:15:55] So we had very religious floor duty. So between, you know, obviously having to fill out the calendar every week. Like I was going to like, you know, court ordered service or something, you know, and then every in the beginning, everybody wanted to get rid of their floor shift. I didn't understand why.
[00:16:14] As I continued in my career, then I was giving rid of getting rid of all my floor shifts. I got it. But I just took everybody's floor shift. So I was just either at the office or at an event all the time.
[00:16:25] All the time. You said that at the beginning when we asked about best advice was go to everything.
[00:16:30] Be in the community, be a part of it, volunteer, give back, meet people, do all of the things that we all know we're supposed to do. Very few people actually show up at the office, get their early, hang out floor time.
[00:16:45] I mean, all of these things, I once interviewed a top agent when I first started this podcast and nobody, and you nobody. And I didn't have anybody to ask to be on the show.
[00:16:55] And he was like, he was my second guest. And he was from a hometown. He was a friend of a friend. And so I was like, can you do me a favor, be on my show. And he was the number seven person in his community.
[00:17:06] Top seven, and I said, what's your secret? He closed a home every three days. And I said, what's the secret? He said, I get in it seven a.m. And I start making my dials. And he just had he had a schedule. And he said, you know, I leave it five p.m. Or whatever it was. And it was like, well, what's the magic formula. And he's like, no, that's it. And I went, what doesn't everybody do that? He goes, no.
[00:17:32] And so, yeah, amazing. Good, good for you. So, winning a work of the year, how many deals did you do in your first year? Do you remember?
[00:17:42] So I think, I think not many. I think it was probably like six maybe like, no, six is a lot. That is a lot for a first year. That's amazing.
[00:17:55] And then you've kind of just gone onward and upward since then. So tell me a little bit about how you think about real estate and, you know, why you think you've, you know, really become a prominent force in your market.
[00:18:11] So I tell my agents this all the time. They could absolutely if they wanted to maybe not an experience, you know, but they could right now if they wanted to leap from me.
[00:18:22] I give them the exact recipe. They could totally do what I have done. And it's just a matter of, of, you know, truly realizing that what's working and you just said it, you know, what's working is working. You know, that's it. There is no magic bullet.
[00:18:36] I mean, yes, you're going to be on social and you're going to do these things, but you have to be out with the people, right. They have to know that you care before they care about you, right.
[00:18:47] I mean, it has to be genuine. They're going to sniff out somebody who doesn't have their best interest in mind. And, you know, we have a little task that I encourage them to do, which we live again in a small rural town.
[00:18:59] And we have a Walmart in our town, but you can go to your grocery store, your publics. And I say, you know, do the Walmart walk around. And every day back in the day at 530, I would put a loaf of bread in my cart and walk around.
[00:19:12] You know, I wasn't there to shop for anything, but I would guarantee walk out the door with at least having had one real estate conversation. They see me all the time. And so we call it the Walmart walk around.
[00:19:22] That is such a smart. I've never heard of anybody doing that. That is brilliant. By the way, I want to stop pause for a second because I want to share what is on the back of of Connie's right behind her up on our wall.
[00:19:34] It says, someone else is happy with less than what you have someone else is happy with less than what you have. And boy, I had to read backwards, but I got it.
[00:19:46] Because of our web gums are backwards. But boy, that is such a power. I imagine gratitude is a big part of your life. Tell me about gratitude.
[00:19:59] Well, you know, I mean, I think that I love bringing in new agents. I love it. I mean, I'll take an experience agent, of course, because I really want somebody to realize it. We are so lucky to get to do what we do, which is help people right honestly and ethically make the largest decision of their life and make sure that they do it with as little risk as possible.
[00:20:21] And that the process is as pleasant and you know that we get them the best deal and the best deal isn't always the least amount of money, right? Maybe it's the right concession or maybe it's the right timing or whatever. So I mean gratitude is you.
[00:20:35] If anybody would have told me back in 2000, right, in 1999 that I would be here today with my name on a shirt, right, and sponsoring little league teams, I would just would have not believed it. Right. I mean, I'm incredibly grateful for the way that my life has unfolded and the blessings that I've had, but gratitude's huge for me.
[00:20:56] And I'm blessed we have a great group here. I mean, I have a phenomenal group of agents and you know, they're all obviously all very like minded and so it's a big deal for us.
[00:21:06] Yeah, I suspect you walk around. You said it and I and I grabbed it right away because I've been trying to implement this more in my life as well.
[00:21:15] This idea of feeling lucky, feeling just like wow, even just hey, I got another day right now. Again, you know, how does that tie in the real estate?
[00:21:24] Well, I don't know, but with respect to mindset, with respect to sort of getting up and going, I get to do this cool thing. Like you said, I get to help somebody ethically and honestly, good through possibly the largest financial transaction of their life, or certainly one of the largest financial transactions.
[00:21:44] I get to help them navigate through this. I get to help them, you know, build a build a home with memories and and you feel super lucky to be able to do this.
[00:21:54] And I can I can just sense that off of you and you actually just said it. And I think if there's anyone listening out there, if you don't feel lucky to do this, I encourage you to start force pushing the idea of feeling lucky.
[00:22:09] Yeah, literally, yeah, think about they can call me they can call me. I'll talk to them. We could have like a five a.m. Jeff,
[00:22:17] Connie will help you feel lucky because the reality of it is that is going to help you when times get tough and times do get tough. And this is a hard job. We all know that.
[00:22:26] And it's the holiday season. It's a very stressful time for a lot of people, even though it's also a joyous time. It's a stressful time in businesses, typically a little slower. So we know that for REALTORS, this isn't always a REALTOR's favorite month.
[00:22:39] But what we can do is feel lucky for the ability that we now are in a career that doesn't have a ceiling. How cool is that?
[00:22:49] Yeah.
[00:22:49] And Connie, you haven't just you weren't just rookie of the year. You actually have become REALTOR of the year. Why do you think you were chosen as REALTOR of the year?
[00:23:01] So that was actually, I mean, not that being rookie of the year wasn't cool because that, but I really didn't understand the, you know, being REALTOR of the year was really cool because it was, it's selected by my peers of my association, right?
[00:23:15] And like the other professionals in our real estate industry. And I know the other individuals that are in my industry, right? In my local market and in Lake County that are just as worthy.
[00:23:26] So, you know, again, we just show up. I mean, education is huge. Right? I'm at all the association classes. Right? So I'm probably just, you're like, oh, Connie, she's the real estate nerd. Yeah, let's, let's make her REALTOR the year.
[00:23:40] But no, I just think it's just a all around commitment, I guess. Yeah, you're all in. I'm all in, you know, I tell a lot of our conversation. This probably going to be what I tell my agents. I'm sorry.
[00:23:52] But I tell my agents, be obsessed. Right? And this is not mine. It's Tim Grovers, right? But be obsessed. You know, when you're with your families, be obsessed with your families.
[00:24:02] When you're in work, be obsessed with work. Right? And I was just fortunate enough that I was allowed to be obsessed for, you know, the first four years of my life in real estate.
[00:24:11] And that I get to be obsessed still. I just obviously my sessions a little different now. Now I love helping my agents build their books of businesses.
[00:24:18] But it doesn't mean you can't have a life. You just be obsessed with that when that time is the right time, you know.
[00:24:27] Great advice. And be obsessed. I cannot agree with you more. It's gotten me really what what being obsessed does, I think, is it's all about skill building.
[00:24:38] If you become obsessed with something, you will develop skill. And that's just how it is. I, as I've gotten older, I've realized the idea of skills are really such a huge part of life.
[00:24:50] And you can just turn that motor, that obsession motor towards whatever you want. And you can develop a skill. So if you're like not particularly good at finance, turn it towards it and make that goal this year.
[00:25:01] And so I suspect you, you do a lot of those things as well. I'm curious about balance. So balance. I don't know that balance is possible. But balance we try to achieve balance, right. We try our best.
[00:25:15] How do you try to attempt to balance work and home life?
[00:25:22] I'm going to be super super vulnerable on that one. I don't do a great job. But, but, right, knowing you have the battle.
[00:25:30] But I've been knowing is half the battle. And we are a single income household in its mind. Right. So be it as all I want to be there. Right. At the back of your brain, you're always like, well, at what cost, right at what cost are you fully present.
[00:25:47] But what I have been able to be better at though. And it's my goal to be better at it in 26 as well is to just, you know, line out the days on the calendar before it starts handed to my family. That way they know what the expectation is as far as my days off and truly just, you know, try to honor that.
[00:26:06] But it hasn't been great. I'm not going to lie. That hasn't been great.
[00:26:08] Well, no, I think it's important that the people that I bring on the show, I love hearing their challenges because of course you have challenges like everybody else. It's, you know, challenges are the path. Right.
[00:26:22] And so the idea is if one thing's going great in your life, something else isn't always going to be great. And we're always going to have problems. And that's just the whack a mole of life. And that's perfectly.
[00:26:33] It appears to be set up that way. And so if you're currently feeling like there's something a little off in your business or your life. Yeah, it's supposed to be that way. And then you can turn your attention towards that.
[00:26:45] And so I'll help smooth out that rough edge. And then you can start. You just always polishing and smoothing. And I totally agree. And I appreciate your vulnerability there and showing that, yeah, you know, you have things to work on too.
[00:26:59] Because it's really the only way we learn is through, you know, I don't want to call them mistakes, but, but opportunities to improve. Right.
[00:27:07] We see like, oh, I'm not really maybe so good at that particular skill. I want to develop a better sense of like you said, I want to be better at honoring my, my home commitments and my work commitments.
[00:27:19] And you know, it's really separating that out. Yeah, that's an awesome thing to focus on. And I appreciate that you said knowing is half the battle. And that is absolutely right to, to I know itself be true to know those kinds of things.
[00:27:35] I, I really, really appreciate that. Now tell us about your team. Tell us how you have it structured. And, you know, how you, you know, help keep your team motivated and keep them moving forward.
[00:27:46] Yeah, so we are, I think what would be considered a traditional real estate model. You know, we don't everybody's independent. So we are, we do call ourselves a group, obviously, just because that's the name I came up with when we started.
[00:28:00] But they're all independent. I don't have any teams currently, even that work, you know, in the office.
[00:28:07] But, you know, the way I, the way that I try to explain it to them and I think that they all get it is, you know, we're like a mall, right. And somebody's macy's and somebody's Spencer's and somebody is Adidas or Foot Locker, whatever it is. I don't know.
[00:28:19] And my job is to make sure that the mall is beautiful, right. But, but my job is also to figure out my, how do I make Spencer shine right out of I make macy's shine. And so figuring out who they are, right.
[00:28:31] Because a lot, again, a lot of my agents are brand new agents, you know, they, they, they come here because we do train so heavily and, and, you know, we are obviously very motivational.
[00:28:40] But for me, it just comes back to basics, you're going to be most successful if we can figure out who you are and what, what scope you want to work in.
[00:28:48] Because if you're trying to push luxury, but you really should be pushing vacant land, right. It's just, it's just not the same. And so I think really at the very, very beginning identifying who they are. And listen, they can change its fluid, right. I mean, they can change have a different business model next year.
[00:29:05] But identifying who they are, what they want to serve. And we trained, we changed it a little bit this year to where when we did their business plans, of course, we're still looking at the numbers.
[00:29:16] But I, everybody's got a certain number of client events that they have to have.
[00:29:21] And I want them all booked by the end of the year. And they've come up with some really cool things like I have one of my agents. He's a big breakfast guy.
[00:29:29] And so he's going to have a pancake breakfast, right. And like that's perfect for him. It's perfect. Right. And so just really figuring out where they're so comfortable. Because when it's natural, it's just so much easier.
[00:29:40] But we have a weekly, we have a weekly meeting. We call it a mastermind meeting. And it's where I share with them. You know, what are the objections out there that I'm hearing, what are some scripts and dialogues.
[00:29:51] I'm very close with Alexis Bolin. And if you don't know, Alexis, he's the queen of objection handling, you should have her on your show.
[00:29:59] But you know, it's just a matter of when somebody poses an objection, right, ask them a question.
[00:30:05] And so we do that every week. And then we just started an AI workshop at night, just it's kind of different.
[00:30:12] And so I'm really happy with the fact that I'm a big part. You know, I've fully adopted it, but I don't know how to put it fully in progress yet. So we're doing that together. But I'm very, very hands on with them. And I don't know that that's the business model for forever.
[00:30:26] But it's the business model of the workforce right now.
[00:30:29] Yeah, I can appreciate that. I think you get obsessed with your agents. It sounds.
[00:30:34] Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.
[00:30:36] And that's something that not every, in particular, every new agent who gets into the business has not everyone has that experience.
[00:30:46] And so if you are an agent that's looking to grow, I sort of think that that's kind of your avatars somebody who's super in, but they just need somebody to kind of give them the guidance and the show them the way I think, obviously, Connie is as a great opportunity for that.
[00:31:03] And so if you are a central Florida agent and you are not getting the attention that you feel you deserve reach out to Connie, she would love love love love to chat with you and boy, she is, she's kind and she's generous with with her time and her energy.
[00:31:19] And like I said at the beginning, very infectious and she's just a fun person to be you can tell she's a fun person to be around.
[00:31:25] Let's talk a little bit about I love the idea of events. You said you really push your agents to have as many events as possible. Tell us about that.
[00:31:35] Yeah. So what I obviously in going back and realizing where the most impact was made in my career and it was, you know, having that built relationship right and that reason where you're not just there to sell something, but you know, you have opportunity to talk, but it's not a networking event.
[00:31:52] You know, I mean, from my one agent that is going to have his pancake breakfast like everybody knows he loves to cook and that he loves breakfast, right. So it's just so natural.
[00:32:01] And I think if we let them have these events that are natural to them and the sphere is obviously the individuals that like that as well.
[00:32:10] I just I feel like it'll be easier for them to build those relationships because of course they want to come in and they want to be, you know, million dollars sales people and it's like wait, wait, right.
[00:32:21] What does that even mean right do you even know what that means right so let's make some let's make some relationships first right let's give before we start asking.
[00:32:29] Yeah, you know, I you're absolutely right. I remember when I was first starting out in this business and I had an agent say to me she was actually on my podcast. She was a local agent and she said, hey, I'm doing you know client event. I would like to invite you to.
[00:32:45] And I said, okay, and she said it's a volunteer event at a well animal shelter and we're going to make toys for dogs out of ripped T shirts and things like that. And I said, oh, that sounds cool.
[00:32:59] And it was nearby where I lived and I so I thought, oh good, this and the reason why I went is because I wanted to volunteer more in my own life.
[00:33:08] And I obviously I didn't need her as a REALTOR. I mean, I was I was an agent. I was in practicing, but I wanted to give back. I wanted to do that. It was fun. I felt more connected than to her going through that experience with her and the other people that were there as well.
[00:33:24] And I thought, you know, what a cool profession that you get to have an event like that where people get to have fun. They're giving back to these animals and being of service in their community.
[00:33:36] Developing relationships with each other. Not talking about real estate necessarily, but but doing things that are good for like the soul and good for the heart and having fun. And I go, there's no other profession. I know that really does this.
[00:33:49] I think about like I've hired attorneys. I've hired a accountant. So I've hired you know all sorts of people, doctors, you know, no other profession. I know does this really. And I'm not here to to cast judgment on that. I just think what a wonderful opportunity REALTOR has to go into their passions, whether it's pancakes or whatever it is.
[00:34:10] And like let's do this and let's make it fun. And I love that that you really put a put a huge premium on that for your agents.
[00:34:19] Yeah, they didn't want. And you know, me listen, we have to know our numbers, right? Because we're still running businesses, but they didn't necessarily want it to be about, you know, I want to make, you know, X amount of dollars by the end of the year.
[00:34:29] It was, I want to grow my my business base by this percentage and said, okay, well, how do we do that? Right? Yes, you can be on social and you can get some Facebook ads and stuff like that. But, you know, how do you get that person to person where you make those raving fans? And again, you can do it on social.
[00:34:44] But at least for us, while we still have this small town feel, it's just a great opportunity.
[00:34:49] What's your what's your perspective on the givers get mentality? So like give, give, give and and you, you, you shall receive 100% at 100%. I mean, my agents know we all kind of feel the same way, right? Help everybody get what they want. You'll get what you want.
[00:35:09] You know, again, we go back. I know there's probably going to be brokers out there that will hate to hear this, you know, but we don't look at the sales board to try to figure out, you know, where the dollars are going to be. We're looking at the people and are we getting them to where they need to go.
[00:35:23] And then the dollars are going to be there. Of course, again, I go back to we still have to run a business, but I remember I was in the business when, when we had the market crash.
[00:35:33] And I remember right before the market crash, I was literally watching every person as if they were a dollar bill. And in my business, I was not, I was not in the right frame of mind and my business suffered dramatically for it because I mean, of course, I never encourage somebody to do something that wasn't in their best interest, but when a deal didn't work.
[00:35:52] It was detrimental. I was like, oh, I'm, you know, my gosh, like this is a dollar amount as opposed to no, this is what's in their best interest. And, you know, making sure, even when you agents, especially making sure that when they come in our door and put on our blue shirt, you know, that they have 90 days plus of reserves in the bank to make sure the electric bill is paid to make sure that groceries on the table, because if not, you can't focus on somebody else when you're hungry.
[00:36:18] You have to feed yourself. And so I really try to make sure that their bases are as covered as possible and that they're, I mean, I'm not covering their bases, but that they're thinking about it, you know, so that then they can do the best that they can do.
[00:36:33] Yeah, I think that's really great advice and, and you're right. It just, you know, making sure you care very much about your agents and you care very much for their success is what I'm, what I'm hearing.
[00:36:47] I want to really just touch on what do you think distinguishes you from other agents?
[00:36:54] So we have, I would say probably personally, and this probably goes to the whole balance thing that I'm really not great at yet.
[00:37:03] You know, I'm incredibly involved at the local level in the municipal and government meetings, right. So as far as really having a really solid foundation on how our city has grown, where it came from, what's infrastructure doing, what's the prospectus, you know, what are the DRIs that are coming into the area.
[00:37:23] Where is the JPA grown just all of the nerdy stuff, right. There's pretty much not a zoning or a city or a county meeting that I miss and it makes for a very challenging schedule.
[00:37:34] But I know for a fact that when people walk down the street and they see me, if they have a question about what's coming, what do they need to do, is their property next to a property that's developing or anything like that, they're going to ask me.
[00:37:46] I mean, I have elected officials that call me because they don't understand the changes that are happening within their city. And to know that they feel comfortable and safe calling me and that I'll explain it to them in a way they understand.
[00:38:00] That's huge for me.
[00:38:01] You've become an expert.
[00:38:04] I suppose.
[00:38:05] Yeah, well, well, you have are certainly people see you as an expert and that is obviously super valuable because this is a professional career and being professional means having knowledge and in particular going that extra step and going to those meetings and making sure that I support this community.
[00:38:26] I'm in this community. I care about this community. I want to know what's going on in this community. I'm going to attend on behalf of because of course I'm in real estate. This is important to me and clients see that.
[00:38:38] And they see you as somebody that cares.
[00:38:42] And that is something that is really significant because that's all we really ever want in anybody that we hire to do a surface.
[00:38:49] We just want them to care about the thing they're doing to such a degree that they are a bit obsessed with it, which really means they're going to just have more information than else.
[00:39:02] I want to really just ask, you know, when an agent is struggling because agents go through of course up and down times and leads aren't always coming in at the exact time that we want.
[00:39:15] And how are you encouraging agents to stay positive? You know, what is it that you tell them to focus on? Give us a little bit of that strategy.
[00:39:24] So this is going to sound like a bunch of fluff what I'm about to say, but my goal is always to get ahead of it. Right. So in October, we were already talking about what's your December with no deals going to look like.
[00:39:39] So the goal is, I mean, because they're going to, but if we can just prime them so much for how bad it's going to be or how bad it could potentially be. Right. Then it's not less than when you've been doing this for 24 years.
[00:39:52] I've been in some really awful times, you know.
[00:39:55] And so really it's so a it's, I think a is preparation, right preparation. Kind of seeing that, you know, what does it look down field so that I know what to tell them.
[00:40:06] But the other part is, you know, if they need money, you know, in the next 10 days, because we've had situations like that, right. We're a deal falls apart. And now this agents counting on that check and it's like, where do I find money in the next 10 days.
[00:40:19] And we say, okay, well, we got to drive for dollars. Right. We're going to call people and let sit down with them. And I say, let's look at your phone book. Right. And let's and I know you can call this person this person and this person show them, you know, talking about these lots that we know are available. And you'll probably get it.
[00:40:34] But you know, even if it's a little cash deal, right. If we can score a little cash deal to help their self esteem right because their mindset's going to be wrecked on that deal dies. So we can get them a little win.
[00:40:44] Then that's great. But it's just a matter of getting as ready as possible. But then if you need quick dollars to grow, where can I get quit dollars.
[00:40:53] I love it. You used a term that I call Copa head this idea of thinking about what's coming and preparing ourself. It's a very stoic kind of approach where we think about everything's going to fall apart in the future. And that's okay. Because I can prepare for that.
[00:41:11] And if I prepare for the things that fall apart, most things don't fall apart. But if I prepare for that, I will be ready and I will be very delighted to when things work out a little better, but at least I'm prepared.
[00:41:24] And that is something that, you know, is not often talked about this idea of thinking Copa head for the challenges that are coming. And you know, it's something that I need to do a better job of myself.
[00:41:38] It's like, what happens if our advertisers go away on this show? Oh, that might happen. Of course it could. And, you know, then I have to think about, okay, you know, I have to have a plan in place for that. And again, we realize in real estate that what we're doing today really is going to bear a few fruit like 90 to 120 days later probably.
[00:41:55] So it's like everything we do today is basically going to have a reaction in a, you know, in three, three months or so. And or three to four months. And so you have this sort of window of time where everything you're doing is really for the future.
[00:42:10] And that's what's kind of interesting is being in the present, but everything you're doing is really for the future in this business, at least.
[00:42:18] And I think that is a really sort of healthy way to look at at real estate because so many things are long term gains or so many so many things are long term goals that instead of short term gains.
[00:42:30] And there are these are very fulfilling things. So what's cool about real estate, what's what's hard about it is when you need something to happen right away, that that's hard.
[00:42:39] But if you can, like you said, if you can have reserves, if you can, you know, sort of whether the storms of that, you know that if you just put your head down, like, you know, you're basically planting seeds that are going to bear fruit in, you know, in the coming months.
[00:42:53] And it is, it's really neat to see. I think it's on one of those cool professions that does have the ability, like the pathway to success has been well traveled, like lots of people have done it.
[00:43:06] We know that there's people with really no business being in real estate who have made a lot of success. And people who shouldn't, you know, be in the business because of their backgrounds shouldn't have led them to this career or they didn't have the, you know, the particular training or whatever.
[00:43:22] And they've gone, are they went to a, they became a real turn, they went to a brokerage that had horrible service and training and they figured it out themselves. And so people make it in all sorts of other ways.
[00:43:32] And then they leave clues or they write books or they do programs or they're like you and they, they share there was experiences, you know, at the local level and the municipal level and also they get obsessed.
[00:43:45] So I really appreciate Connie, someone like you who is so all in it's really inspiring to, to me, I know hopefully our audience as well.
[00:43:55] And on behalf of our audience, I want to thank Connie for jumping on our podcast today. She is just such a wonderful joy.
[00:44:03] By the way, she is in central Florida and people leave their, their residences to have new residences in Florida, sometimes later times of life that happens. Of course, people move down south. I know my parents have done that. Also my sister.
[00:44:18] And if you are an agent that has people that are moving out of your area into Florida or vice versa, Connie would love to chat with you. So if you have an opportunity for her reach out Connie may hand it's MAH and find her on Facebook, Instagram. She's all over the place.
[00:44:33] And she's REALTOR of the year like how wouldn't that be cool to say I've got somebody for you. She was REALTOR of the year. That would be somebody I would want to refer to.
[00:44:43] So let's get those referrals over to Connie and on behalf of Connie, obviously we want to thank the fans and listeners of the show. We appreciate you. You've been with us for, well, whether you're new or that you've been with us for years and years. We appreciate you.
[00:44:56] Appreciate our sponsors. Thank you to everyone. We're wrapping up 2020, 2025 and we're going to be coming into a 2026. We encourage everybody to help us out by telling a friend about this show. Think of one other agent that could benefit from hearing this conversation with Connie and shoot them over a link where everywhere podcasts are served. You can find us.
[00:45:15] And also follow us on social media. Just search for us. We're there. And we will see everybody on the next episode. Thanks Connie.
[00:45:24] Thanks so much DJ.

We have some new exciting types of episodes we're going to do. We'll keep you in the loop on that. But for now, let's just get right onto my conversation with Connie Mayhan. As to advice you perceived in real estate. That's easy. The best advice I received was from my very first broker. When I got into real estate, I was not from here. I did not obviously go to school here and I didn't go to church with anybody. I didn't know anyone. I didn't know the roads. And we have a local paper. It's what's called the Sumter Shopper back then and it had a calendar of events. And she handed me the paper and she said, I want you to go to every single one of these events, every single one of these things every week. She's like, and sign up to do something. So it was like, Kiwanis Club, Rotary Club, Relay for Life, the local chamber. And, you know, I just signed up for something and I just showed up every week or every month, I should say, but every it was every week because there was a different one going on every week. And, you know, back then my broker's name is Mickey Blackburn. It was Connie Mayhan with Mickey Blackburn Realty for 10 years. But the best advice was literally to get in and do and the rest will figure itself out. And to come back to her too, I did like take notes because we didn't have phones. I'm going to like take a selfie, right? So I did like take notes and be like, look, I served coffee, right? Or I send up for sponsorship. I love it. Worst advice you've received in real estate. Worst advice and I use a portion of this now. So no offense to anybody. But at the time when it was given to me, the worst advice was to go all in on buying leads. And we went, I would say it's probably around 2014 and we went big. We didn't just do a zip code or two. We bought all the zip codes. Because we also really didn't know what that was going to mean. And the volume of business was incredible. But it was just there was zero time for relationship making zero. It was just on my, I mean, we made a bucket of money. We spent a bucket of money. But yeah, buying leads as a broker now, it's, I definitely, you know, try to teach my agents a different model. But we went all in and I probably can't remember one name of who I sold a house to that year. Yeah. Yeah, more transactional. I designed, but just by the fact of the sheer volume of leads up that we're coming in. I certainly understand, understand that. And yeah, working by referral seems to be the name of the game.

Connie, welcome to the show. Thank you. Thank you. It's a pleasure. I appreciate being here. You have one of, and for those of you listening, you won't be able to see this, but you have one of the most infectious smiles and energies. I've done a lot of these episodes, 700, I believe. Wow. Boy, your smile is just, I, it's one of, it's my, on my all-time favorite smiles, I get to look at this for another hour. I'm so happy to do this. You instantly have made my day brighter, and I suspect you hear that a lot from clients. You have an energy to you that our audience is about to, no pressure by the way to. No pressure. And, and, and, but it is just kind of your disposition, and I am so excited to learn about you. So tell us a little bit about your journey. How did you start in real estate? So it's actually, it has become really kind of one of my favorite stories, because I had no plan of getting into real estate. I didn't know about real estate. I didn't own home. I was actually in restaurant management in New Orleans, and had come to Florida to spend some time with my grandmother and in my mom. And then in, in that time frame, I was. I was watching dishes at a local restaurant for the breakfast shift and stocking shelves at a warehouse in the afternoon literally was just taking a break from life. And a friend of mine, a lady that I knew from the restaurant she wanted to get her real estate license. And at the time, the only class it was being offered was in the town about an hour away on Tuesday and Thursday nights. And she wasn't comfortable driving a night because she was older. And she asked me, after my breakfast shift and my afternoon shift, if she could pay me to drive her to real estate school. And, and I was like, well, how much does the class cost? And in fact, then it was only 250 bucks. And I said, well, why don't you pay for me to take the class with you and we'll just do it together. And that was it. I had a phenomenal teacher that teacher Nina Papis. She had just come to Florida from California. She was a Greek woman, originally in the corporate world was Xerox, but just dominated real estate. And she was just super dynamic. And I mean, I was in just it was meant to be. I was just in right away. And obviously I quit the dishwasher job and I quit the shop still shelf stocking job and just went all in. Wow. And that is that is a big jump, by the way, to go to go from, you know, more of a more simple task job to now dealing with someone's largest financial transaction is a major lift, right. And that is that's an incredible. I love hearing stories like that. What gave you sort of the confidence to move from from eight is you went from a to Z basically. Truly. Well, my previous, we'll call it my previous life. So I was in fine dining restaurant management right before. So dealing with people and, you know, expectations and that kind of stuff. I was already very comfortable with that. But I think what helped me is there was no social media back then, right. So I had nothing to compare myself to. I just knew that I was going to go out, do a great job, you know, deal honestly and fairly. You know, work until the job was done. And I just had the consumers best interest in mine and that was it, you know. I'm so glad that you said that. And I, I really appreciate your perspective on social media because it is a comparison game. And we often don't talk about this. And certainly we don't have to get into it too much on this episode. But it is something to think about that we, the expression goes something like we compare our insides to someone else's outsides. Right. And we see that on Instagram in particular with the perfect filters and everybody looking a certain way. And I know if it was me and I was in high school and we had social media and I wasn't invited to a party. Maybe I was about it on Monday. And then I would be like crushed because I wasn't invited. But if I were to see pictures of it on social media, the next Monday, you know, and there's an adult version of this as well. And you said something very important because I started as a dishwasher as well. And when I, when I was, when I was a teenager and it didn't occur to me that there was anything like low level about that. I just went, well, I'll just be the best dishwasher. Absolutely. You know, and yeah, and I just kind of thought whatever I do, I want to be good at it. And it doesn't because when you're good at things, people appreciate that and they pay you and you tend to not get fired and maybe even promoted and things like that. And I just saw that the people that had the most respect I started in restaurants were the ones that seemed to work the hardest or at least appeared to, you know, just do do the take the job the most most seriously as they could. And so I was I'm right with you on that. I think everybody should have a food service job at some point to just understand that is a, that is a, that is a rough job. And you know, we, we, we don't often, you know, give our people in that industry as much respect. And you know, it's a good thing to do a good job. And so I think it's really good to do a good job as a server. And you know, obviously, that carries over into real estate. So let's talk about that journey. So you went, you did kind of a night school situation. You had somebody sort of sponsor you and then, okay, you have your license. And then now it's like, okay, now I have to get clients. So how did that work? So actually, I'll back up for one second. First, I had to find a broker. So I interviewed with 11 brokers. And they all said no. Yes, they all said no. And then finally, I came across a lady who was an office manager. The broker that I ended up working with. And she's an I interviewed with her as, you know, really internally defeated walking in the door. But I'm still going to smile. Still going to walk in. We're still going to do this, right. And she said, I think Mickey will like you. And sure enough, I went and at the time. And still to this day, you know, she's just definitely a name in real estate in our area. You know, me epic businesswoman. She was a great broker. And she took one look at me and she's like, hmm, I think we could figure this out. And that was it. So I had to start there. First was actually even getting hired. And it was funny because that first year, I was fortunate. I won rookie of the year. And some of the brokers that I interviewed with are like, huh, but that was a mistake. I mean, 11 knows is first of all, you're like, I assume you have the same disposition today as you did then. I mean, I don't know. Maybe it's changed a little. I don't, but I suspect you're the same person you've always been. And you're the most kind of love. Like you are just an easy person to be around. I am shocked that anyone would say to you, I am a recruiter. I recruit REALTORS. I would love to have you if I was a Florida REALTOR. I'd be like, I'll over. I got to get caught. I'm here. So I am, I'm shocked to hear that. But what a wonderful thing to be able to persevere and God, that would decimate my courage. And the fact is it certainly didn't decimate yours. And you got into it. So how did you find clients right away? So we had very religious floor duty. So between, you know, obviously having to fill out the calendar every week. Like I was going to like, you know, court ordered service or something, you know, and then every in the beginning, everybody wanted to get rid of their floor shift. I didn't understand why. As I continued in my career, then I was giving rid of getting rid of all my floor shifts. I got it. But I just took everybody's floor shift. So I was just either at the office or at an event all the time. All the time. You said that at the beginning when we asked about best advice was go to everything. Be in the community, be a part of it, volunteer, give back, meet people, do all of the things that we all know we're supposed to do. Very few people actually show up at the office, get their early, hang out floor time. I mean, all of these things, I once interviewed a top agent when I first started this podcast and nobody, and you nobody. And I didn't have anybody to ask to be on the show. And he was like, he was my second guest. And he was from a hometown. He was a friend of a friend. And so I was like, can you do me a favor, be on my show. And he was the number seven person in his community. Top seven, and I said, what's your secret? He closed a home every three days. And I said, what's the secret? He said, I get in it seven a.m. And I start making my dials. And he just had he had a schedule. And he said, you know, I leave it five p.m. Or whatever it was. And it was like, well, what's the magic formula. And he's like, no, that's it. And I went, what doesn't everybody do that? He goes, no. And so, yeah, amazing. Good, good for you. So, winning a work of the year, how many deals did you do in your first year? Do you remember? So I think, I think not many. I think it was probably like six maybe like, no, six is a lot. That is a lot for a first year. That's amazing. And then you've kind of just gone onward and upward since then. So tell me a little bit about how you think about real estate and, you know, why you think you've, you know, really become a prominent force in your market. So I tell my agents this all the time. They could absolutely if they wanted to maybe not an experience, you know, but they could right now if they wanted to leap from me. I give them the exact recipe. They could totally do what I have done. And it's just a matter of, of, you know, truly realizing that what's working and you just said it, you know, what's working is working. You know, that's it. There is no magic bullet. I mean, yes, you're going to be on social and you're going to do these things, but you have to be out with the people, right. They have to know that you care before they care about you, right. I mean, it has to be genuine. They're going to sniff out somebody who doesn't have their best interest in mind. And, you know, we have a little task that I encourage them to do, which we live again in a small rural town. And we have a Walmart in our town, but you can go to your grocery store, your publics. And I say, you know, do the Walmart walk around. And every day back in the day at 530, I would put a loaf of bread in my cart and walk around. You know, I wasn't there to shop for anything, but I would guarantee walk out the door with at least having had one real estate conversation. They see me all the time. And so we call it the Walmart walk around. That is such a smart. I've never heard of anybody doing that. That is brilliant. By the way, I want to stop pause for a second because I want to share what is on the back of of Connie's right behind her up on our wall. It says, someone else is happy with less than what you have someone else is happy with less than what you have. And boy, I had to read backwards, but I got it. Because of our web gums are backwards. But boy, that is such a power. I imagine gratitude is a big part of your life. Tell me about gratitude. Well, you know, I mean, I think that I love bringing in new agents. I love it. I mean, I'll take an experience agent, of course, because I really want somebody to realize it. We are so lucky to get to do what we do, which is help people right honestly and ethically make the largest decision of their life and make sure that they do it with as little risk as possible. And that the process is as pleasant and you know that we get them the best deal and the best deal isn't always the least amount of money, right? Maybe it's the right concession or maybe it's the right timing or whatever. So I mean gratitude is you. If anybody would have told me back in 2000, right, in 1999 that I would be here today with my name on a shirt, right, and sponsoring little league teams, I would just would have not believed it. Right. I mean, I'm incredibly grateful for the way that my life has unfolded and the blessings that I've had, but gratitude's huge for me. And I'm blessed we have a great group here. I mean, I have a phenomenal group of agents and you know, they're all obviously all very like minded and so it's a big deal for us. Yeah, I suspect you walk around. You said it and I and I grabbed it right away because I've been trying to implement this more in my life as well. This idea of feeling lucky, feeling just like wow, even just hey, I got another day right now. Again, you know, how does that tie in the real estate? Well, I don't know, but with respect to mindset, with respect to sort of getting up and going, I get to do this cool thing. Like you said, I get to help somebody ethically and honestly, good through possibly the largest financial transaction of their life, or certainly one of the largest financial transactions. I get to help them navigate through this. I get to help them, you know, build a build a home with memories and and you feel super lucky to be able to do this. And I can I can just sense that off of you and you actually just said it. And I think if there's anyone listening out there, if you don't feel lucky to do this, I encourage you to start force pushing the idea of feeling lucky. Yeah, literally, yeah, think about they can call me they can call me. I'll talk to them. We could have like a five a.m. Jeff, Connie will help you feel lucky because the reality of it is that is going to help you when times get tough and times do get tough. And this is a hard job. We all know that. And it's the holiday season. It's a very stressful time for a lot of people, even though it's also a joyous time. It's a stressful time in businesses, typically a little slower. So we know that for REALTORS, this isn't always a REALTOR's favorite month. But what we can do is feel lucky for the ability that we now are in a career that doesn't have a ceiling. How cool is that? Yeah. And Connie, you haven't just you weren't just rookie of the year. You actually have become REALTOR of the year. Why do you think you were chosen as REALTOR of the year? So that was actually, I mean, not that being rookie of the year wasn't cool because that, but I really didn't understand the, you know, being REALTOR of the year was really cool because it was, it's selected by my peers of my association, right? And like the other professionals in our real estate industry. And I know the other individuals that are in my industry, right? In my local market and in Lake County that are just as worthy. So, you know, again, we just show up. I mean, education is huge. Right? I'm at all the association classes. Right? So I'm probably just, you're like, oh, Connie, she's the real estate nerd. Yeah, let's, let's make her REALTOR the year. But no, I just think it's just a all around commitment, I guess. Yeah, you're all in. I'm all in, you know, I tell a lot of our conversation. This probably going to be what I tell my agents. I'm sorry. But I tell my agents, be obsessed. Right? And this is not mine. It's Tim Grovers, right? But be obsessed. You know, when you're with your families, be obsessed with your families. When you're in work, be obsessed with work. Right? And I was just fortunate enough that I was allowed to be obsessed for, you know, the first four years of my life in real estate. And that I get to be obsessed still. I just obviously my sessions a little different now. Now I love helping my agents build their books of businesses. But it doesn't mean you can't have a life. You just be obsessed with that when that time is the right time, you know. Great advice. And be obsessed. I cannot agree with you more. It's gotten me really what what being obsessed does, I think, is it's all about skill building. If you become obsessed with something, you will develop skill. And that's just how it is. I, as I've gotten older, I've realized the idea of skills are really such a huge part of life. And you can just turn that motor, that obsession motor towards whatever you want. And you can develop a skill. So if you're like not particularly good at finance, turn it towards it and make that goal this year. And so I suspect you, you do a lot of those things as well. I'm curious about balance. So balance. I don't know that balance is possible. But balance we try to achieve balance, right. We try our best. How do you try to attempt to balance work and home life? I'm going to be super super vulnerable on that one. I don't do a great job. But, but, right, knowing you have the battle. But I've been knowing is half the battle. And we are a single income household in its mind. Right. So be it as all I want to be there. Right. At the back of your brain, you're always like, well, at what cost, right at what cost are you fully present. But what I have been able to be better at though. And it's my goal to be better at it in 26 as well is to just, you know, line out the days on the calendar before it starts handed to my family. That way they know what the expectation is as far as my days off and truly just, you know, try to honor that. But it hasn't been great. I'm not going to lie. That hasn't been great. Well, no, I think it's important that the people that I bring on the show, I love hearing their challenges because of course you have challenges like everybody else. It's, you know, challenges are the path. Right. And so the idea is if one thing's going great in your life, something else isn't always going to be great. And we're always going to have problems. And that's just the whack a mole of life. And that's perfectly. It appears to be set up that way. And so if you're currently feeling like there's something a little off in your business or your life. Yeah, it's supposed to be that way. And then you can turn your attention towards that. And so I'll help smooth out that rough edge. And then you can start. You just always polishing and smoothing. And I totally agree. And I appreciate your vulnerability there and showing that, yeah, you know, you have things to work on too. Because it's really the only way we learn is through, you know, I don't want to call them mistakes, but, but opportunities to improve. Right. We see like, oh, I'm not really maybe so good at that particular skill. I want to develop a better sense of like you said, I want to be better at honoring my, my home commitments and my work commitments. And you know, it's really separating that out. Yeah, that's an awesome thing to focus on. And I appreciate that you said knowing is half the battle. And that is absolutely right to, to I know itself be true to know those kinds of things. I, I really, really appreciate that. Now tell us about your team. Tell us how you have it structured. And, you know, how you, you know, help keep your team motivated and keep them moving forward. Yeah, so we are, I think what would be considered a traditional real estate model. You know, we don't everybody's independent. So we are, we do call ourselves a group, obviously, just because that's the name I came up with when we started. But they're all independent. I don't have any teams currently, even that work, you know, in the office. But, you know, the way I, the way that I try to explain it to them and I think that they all get it is, you know, we're like a mall, right. And somebody's macy's and somebody's Spencer's and somebody is Adidas or Foot Locker, whatever it is. I don't know. And my job is to make sure that the mall is beautiful, right. But, but my job is also to figure out my, how do I make Spencer shine right out of I make macy's shine. And so figuring out who they are, right. Because a lot, again, a lot of my agents are brand new agents, you know, they, they, they come here because we do train so heavily and, and, you know, we are obviously very motivational. But for me, it just comes back to basics, you're going to be most successful if we can figure out who you are and what, what scope you want to work in. Because if you're trying to push luxury, but you really should be pushing vacant land, right. It's just, it's just not the same. And so I think really at the very, very beginning identifying who they are. And listen, they can change its fluid, right. I mean, they can change have a different business model next year. But identifying who they are, what they want to serve. And we trained, we changed it a little bit this year to where when we did their business plans, of course, we're still looking at the numbers. But I, everybody's got a certain number of client events that they have to have. And I want them all booked by the end of the year. And they've come up with some really cool things like I have one of my agents. He's a big breakfast guy. And so he's going to have a pancake breakfast, right. And like that's perfect for him. It's perfect. Right. And so just really figuring out where they're so comfortable. Because when it's natural, it's just so much easier. But we have a weekly, we have a weekly meeting. We call it a mastermind meeting. And it's where I share with them. You know, what are the objections out there that I'm hearing, what are some scripts and dialogues. I'm very close with Alexis Bolin. And if you don't know, Alexis, he's the queen of objection handling, you should have her on your show. But you know, it's just a matter of when somebody poses an objection, right, ask them a question. And so we do that every week. And then we just started an AI workshop at night, just it's kind of different. And so I'm really happy with the fact that I'm a big part. You know, I've fully adopted it, but I don't know how to put it fully in progress yet. So we're doing that together. But I'm very, very hands on with them. And I don't know that that's the business model for forever. But it's the business model of the workforce right now. Yeah, I can appreciate that. I think you get obsessed with your agents. It sounds. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. And that's something that not every, in particular, every new agent who gets into the business has not everyone has that experience. And so if you are an agent that's looking to grow, I sort of think that that's kind of your avatars somebody who's super in, but they just need somebody to kind of give them the guidance and the show them the way I think, obviously, Connie is as a great opportunity for that. And so if you are a central Florida agent and you are not getting the attention that you feel you deserve reach out to Connie, she would love love love love to chat with you and boy, she is, she's kind and she's generous with with her time and her energy. And like I said at the beginning, very infectious and she's just a fun person to be you can tell she's a fun person to be around. Let's talk a little bit about I love the idea of events. You said you really push your agents to have as many events as possible. Tell us about that. Yeah. So what I obviously in going back and realizing where the most impact was made in my career and it was, you know, having that built relationship right and that reason where you're not just there to sell something, but you know, you have opportunity to talk, but it's not a networking event. You know, I mean, from my one agent that is going to have his pancake breakfast like everybody knows he loves to cook and that he loves breakfast, right. So it's just so natural. And I think if we let them have these events that are natural to them and the sphere is obviously the individuals that like that as well. I just I feel like it'll be easier for them to build those relationships because of course they want to come in and they want to be, you know, million dollars sales people and it's like wait, wait, right. What does that even mean right do you even know what that means right so let's make some let's make some relationships first right let's give before we start asking. Yeah, you know, I you're absolutely right. I remember when I was first starting out in this business and I had an agent say to me she was actually on my podcast. She was a local agent and she said, hey, I'm doing you know client event. I would like to invite you to. And I said, okay, and she said it's a volunteer event at a well animal shelter and we're going to make toys for dogs out of ripped T shirts and things like that. And I said, oh, that sounds cool. And it was nearby where I lived and I so I thought, oh good, this and the reason why I went is because I wanted to volunteer more in my own life. And I obviously I didn't need her as a REALTOR. I mean, I was I was an agent. I was in practicing, but I wanted to give back. I wanted to do that. It was fun. I felt more connected than to her going through that experience with her and the other people that were there as well. And I thought, you know, what a cool profession that you get to have an event like that where people get to have fun. They're giving back to these animals and being of service in their community. Developing relationships with each other. Not talking about real estate necessarily, but but doing things that are good for like the soul and good for the heart and having fun. And I go, there's no other profession. I know that really does this. I think about like I've hired attorneys. I've hired a accountant. So I've hired you know all sorts of people, doctors, you know, no other profession. I know does this really. And I'm not here to to cast judgment on that. I just think what a wonderful opportunity REALTOR has to go into their passions, whether it's pancakes or whatever it is. And like let's do this and let's make it fun. And I love that that you really put a put a huge premium on that for your agents. Yeah, they didn't want. And you know, me listen, we have to know our numbers, right? Because we're still running businesses, but they didn't necessarily want it to be about, you know, I want to make, you know, X amount of dollars by the end of the year. It was, I want to grow my my business base by this percentage and said, okay, well, how do we do that? Right? Yes, you can be on social and you can get some Facebook ads and stuff like that. But, you know, how do you get that person to person where you make those raving fans? And again, you can do it on social. But at least for us, while we still have this small town feel, it's just a great opportunity. What's your what's your perspective on the givers get mentality? So like give, give, give and and you, you, you shall receive 100% at 100%. I mean, my agents know we all kind of feel the same way, right? Help everybody get what they want. You'll get what you want. You know, again, we go back. I know there's probably going to be brokers out there that will hate to hear this, you know, but we don't look at the sales board to try to figure out, you know, where the dollars are going to be. We're looking at the people and are we getting them to where they need to go. And then the dollars are going to be there. Of course, again, I go back to we still have to run a business, but I remember I was in the business when, when we had the market crash. And I remember right before the market crash, I was literally watching every person as if they were a dollar bill. And in my business, I was not, I was not in the right frame of mind and my business suffered dramatically for it because I mean, of course, I never encourage somebody to do something that wasn't in their best interest, but when a deal didn't work. It was detrimental. I was like, oh, I'm, you know, my gosh, like this is a dollar amount as opposed to no, this is what's in their best interest. And, you know, making sure, even when you agents, especially making sure that when they come in our door and put on our blue shirt, you know, that they have 90 days plus of reserves in the bank to make sure the electric bill is paid to make sure that groceries on the table, because if not, you can't focus on somebody else when you're hungry. You have to feed yourself. And so I really try to make sure that their bases are as covered as possible and that they're, I mean, I'm not covering their bases, but that they're thinking about it, you know, so that then they can do the best that they can do. Yeah, I think that's really great advice and, and you're right. It just, you know, making sure you care very much about your agents and you care very much for their success is what I'm, what I'm hearing. I want to really just touch on what do you think distinguishes you from other agents? So we have, I would say probably personally, and this probably goes to the whole balance thing that I'm really not great at yet. You know, I'm incredibly involved at the local level in the municipal and government meetings, right. So as far as really having a really solid foundation on how our city has grown, where it came from, what's infrastructure doing, what's the prospectus, you know, what are the DRIs that are coming into the area. Where is the JPA grown just all of the nerdy stuff, right. There's pretty much not a zoning or a city or a county meeting that I miss and it makes for a very challenging schedule. But I know for a fact that when people walk down the street and they see me, if they have a question about what's coming, what do they need to do, is their property next to a property that's developing or anything like that, they're going to ask me. I mean, I have elected officials that call me because they don't understand the changes that are happening within their city. And to know that they feel comfortable and safe calling me and that I'll explain it to them in a way they understand. That's huge for me. You've become an expert. I suppose. Yeah, well, well, you have are certainly people see you as an expert and that is obviously super valuable because this is a professional career and being professional means having knowledge and in particular going that extra step and going to those meetings and making sure that I support this community. I'm in this community. I care about this community. I want to know what's going on in this community. I'm going to attend on behalf of because of course I'm in real estate. This is important to me and clients see that. And they see you as somebody that cares. And that is something that is really significant because that's all we really ever want in anybody that we hire to do a surface. We just want them to care about the thing they're doing to such a degree that they are a bit obsessed with it, which really means they're going to just have more information than else. I want to really just ask, you know, when an agent is struggling because agents go through of course up and down times and leads aren't always coming in at the exact time that we want. And how are you encouraging agents to stay positive? You know, what is it that you tell them to focus on? Give us a little bit of that strategy. So this is going to sound like a bunch of fluff what I'm about to say, but my goal is always to get ahead of it. Right. So in October, we were already talking about what's your December with no deals going to look like. So the goal is, I mean, because they're going to, but if we can just prime them so much for how bad it's going to be or how bad it could potentially be. Right. Then it's not less than when you've been doing this for 24 years. I've been in some really awful times, you know. And so really it's so a it's, I think a is preparation, right preparation. Kind of seeing that, you know, what does it look down field so that I know what to tell them. But the other part is, you know, if they need money, you know, in the next 10 days, because we've had situations like that, right. We're a deal falls apart. And now this agents counting on that check and it's like, where do I find money in the next 10 days. And we say, okay, well, we got to drive for dollars. Right. We're going to call people and let sit down with them. And I say, let's look at your phone book. Right. And let's and I know you can call this person this person and this person show them, you know, talking about these lots that we know are available. And you'll probably get it. But you know, even if it's a little cash deal, right. If we can score a little cash deal to help their self esteem right because their mindset's going to be wrecked on that deal dies. So we can get them a little win. Then that's great. But it's just a matter of getting as ready as possible. But then if you need quick dollars to grow, where can I get quit dollars. I love it. You used a term that I call Copa head this idea of thinking about what's coming and preparing ourself. It's a very stoic kind of approach where we think about everything's going to fall apart in the future. And that's okay. Because I can prepare for that. And if I prepare for the things that fall apart, most things don't fall apart. But if I prepare for that, I will be ready and I will be very delighted to when things work out a little better, but at least I'm prepared. And that is something that, you know, is not often talked about this idea of thinking Copa head for the challenges that are coming. And you know, it's something that I need to do a better job of myself. It's like, what happens if our advertisers go away on this show? Oh, that might happen. Of course it could. And, you know, then I have to think about, okay, you know, I have to have a plan in place for that. And again, we realize in real estate that what we're doing today really is going to bear a few fruit like 90 to 120 days later probably. So it's like everything we do today is basically going to have a reaction in a, you know, in three, three months or so. And or three to four months. And so you have this sort of window of time where everything you're doing is really for the future. And that's what's kind of interesting is being in the present, but everything you're doing is really for the future in this business, at least. And I think that is a really sort of healthy way to look at at real estate because so many things are long term gains or so many so many things are long term goals that instead of short term gains. And there are these are very fulfilling things. So what's cool about real estate, what's what's hard about it is when you need something to happen right away, that that's hard. But if you can, like you said, if you can have reserves, if you can, you know, sort of whether the storms of that, you know that if you just put your head down, like, you know, you're basically planting seeds that are going to bear fruit in, you know, in the coming months. And it is, it's really neat to see. I think it's on one of those cool professions that does have the ability, like the pathway to success has been well traveled, like lots of people have done it. We know that there's people with really no business being in real estate who have made a lot of success. And people who shouldn't, you know, be in the business because of their backgrounds shouldn't have led them to this career or they didn't have the, you know, the particular training or whatever. And they've gone, are they went to a, they became a real turn, they went to a brokerage that had horrible service and training and they figured it out themselves. And so people make it in all sorts of other ways. And then they leave clues or they write books or they do programs or they're like you and they, they share there was experiences, you know, at the local level and the municipal level and also they get obsessed. So I really appreciate Connie, someone like you who is so all in it's really inspiring to, to me, I know hopefully our audience as well. And on behalf of our audience, I want to thank Connie for jumping on our podcast today. She is just such a wonderful joy. By the way, she is in central Florida and people leave their, their residences to have new residences in Florida, sometimes later times of life that happens. Of course, people move down south.
