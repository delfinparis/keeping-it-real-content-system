[00:04:58] Eric, welcome to the show.
[00:04:59] Hey, DJ, thank you so much.
[00:05:01] Thank you for all of the plugs.
[00:05:03] And it's a pleasure to be here.
[00:05:05] I'm looking forward to our conversation.
[00:05:06] So thanks for having me.
[00:05:08] Well, I am looking forward to it as well.
[00:05:10] I would like to start, I guess at the start.
[00:05:13] So I do that with almost all of our guests,
[00:05:16] but I am really interested, especially with somebody who's been in real estate for almost 20 years now.
[00:05:22] How did you get in and why?
[00:05:25] Well, I love telling the story and many like many of your guests as I listened to your podcasts, you know, there's.
[00:05:32] It seems like we all have these strange ways of finding real estate.
[00:05:36] You know, it's not something that that seems like is the beginning of our path as we grow up and go through school
[00:05:42] and into college.
[00:05:44] So I actually moved to New York City to be an actor back in 1998 after graduating from college and starting a theater company in Minneapolis before moving to New York.
[00:05:58] So I had dreams of becoming an actor.
[00:06:00] I was an actor in New York for about 10 years.
[00:06:03] I did the tour thing and I did regional theater and commercials and voice overwork.
[00:06:09] And then I met my wife and doing a regional theater job in Roanoke, Virginia.
[00:06:15] She was a dancer.
[00:06:16] I was a character actor and a singer.
[00:06:20] And shortly after that, I think I realized that the theater world gave me what it was going to give me and I found my wife.
[00:06:29] And I needed to make a change.
[00:06:31] I was not a successful actor.
[00:06:33] I was not making a great living doing it.
[00:06:35] And so shortly after getting married, I was recovering from a knee injury from knee surgery and I was tempting.
[00:06:43] I couldn't work in restaurants anymore because of my knee.
[00:06:46] I was not acting.
[00:06:48] And I met somebody who was at a temp job, but was also taking phone calls for real estate.
[00:06:54] He's the first person that actually gave me a real kind of behind the scenes or under the hood look at what real estate was.
[00:07:05] Without sugar coating it, without making it into this fantasy.
[00:07:09] And he said, look, you see, I'm here at this temp job because sometimes, you know, the money is flowing and sometimes it's not.
[00:07:15] I'm trying to go to law school.
[00:07:17] And so you do what you have to do.
[00:07:19] But here are the skills required and here's what would make a real estate professional.
[00:07:23] And I left that temp job thinking, I think this is something I would be good at.
[00:07:30] And so the next week, I signed up for pre licensing in New York.
[00:07:34] The pre licensing process is ridiculously easy.
[00:07:38] It's a little bit harder now than it was, but it was a couple hundred dollars and 45 hours worth of classroom work and then taking your tests.
[00:07:47] So two weeks later, there I am.
[00:07:48] I'm a licensed real estate professional looking for a brokerage.
[00:07:52] And I was lucky enough to align myself with a company, a small company that was really good at helping generate and acquire leads for their agents.
[00:08:05] So I didn't have to do the whole Craigslist thing, getting my own leads.
[00:08:10] And I was able to hone my craft working with a lot of clients because I was given opportunities.
[00:08:15] I was given at bats, as we say.
[00:08:16] And so I spent 10 years at that company, 10 years at that firm before then leaping and going back into brokerage after being a director of sales and development for five years.
[00:08:28] So I grew with that firm.
[00:08:30] They were a small firm and I grew that firm in management and then went back into the field as an agent.
[00:08:36] And then shortly after that, I was introduced to the real estate negotiation institute.
[00:08:40] So I had 10 years of experience in the business and I took a continuing education course on collaborative negotiation through this company, the real estate negotiation institute.
[00:08:51] And I left that class completely blown away, blown away by the content blown away by these, the style of the teaching blown away by everything.
[00:09:01] And I shortly thereafter contacted Tom Haman, who's the founder and CEO of the real estate negotiation institute and said, I think I need to coach for you.
[00:09:11] I think I need to be an instructor.
[00:09:13] So I so that started my journey being a master certified negotiation expert and a national instructor for the real estate negotiation institute, which I've been doing now for almost eight years, while also having a full time real estate practice at Brown Harris students.
[00:09:30] Wow, and we should mention too that you have a coaching company for real estate agents archway partners, ink. Tell us tell us a little bit about that.
[00:09:38] Well, it's interesting Mike. I was doing when I teach my courses, my negotiation courses, I always inevitably have a few agents who wants some additional coaching, who wants some additional help.
[00:09:50] And what I started doing was doing more mentorship, consulting, I called it coaching, and it wasn't.
[00:09:57] And it wasn't until I went on the journey of actually going through a coaching program, I went through a program that coach you for several months, and then got my own mentor coach, so that I could really learn what it is to coach, what it is to walk alongside someone, support them.
[00:10:16] And be more of an accountability partner and a support for them in their journey. What is it that they want to achieve? What is it that they want to do with their real estate career?
[00:10:27] What are your core values? Where have you been? Where are you and where do you want to go? And when I really started to understand my role as a coach, it became this beautiful marriage because what we talk about in the certified negotiation expert designation courses.
[00:10:44] Is this idea of value proposition, right? The cost benefit analysis. And what are your benefits? How do you develop that value proposition? How do you understand what you have to offer any decision maker, any purchaser, any landlord, right?
[00:10:59] So that's our jumping off point. That's our tangent point, the value proposition. And when we look at that through a coaching lens, there are so many places we can go with that when we understand who we are, when we understand what we offer, and then how do we tailor that to each and every client.
[00:11:15] So that's where archway partners, you know, the idea of the of the archway, the doorway and walking through to new possibilities came from and now I've had my coaching company for about 18 months now.
[00:11:28] That's incredible. Congratulations on that. I was I was thinking if I were an agent in New York City, one of the and really anywhere, but specifically because you practice in New York City.
[00:11:40] And I want to talk about what the benefits are to becoming a certified negotiation expert and why collaborative cooperation is really a sorry collaborative.
[00:11:53] I apologize for the term that you use that I.
[00:11:55] I'll get cooperation fits right in there. So yeah, I was thinking a couple of things I want to talk about with that because you sort of spark something that I hadn't thought of before.
[00:12:09] But I do want to mention before I get to in depth and I always forget to mention this, but if you are an agent in the New York area New York City in particular, Eric's team is always looking for talented agents to, you know, add value and where they can add value to you.
[00:12:24] So I was thinking as you were talking, if I was looking for for a team, one of the things that agents, I think these these days just behind the scenes for a lot of people.
[00:12:34] If you're not sort of even haven't figured this out yet, working as an agent, a lot of times the managing brokers of firms are have a lot of responsibilities.
[00:12:43] They have to recruit talent. They have to retain talent. They have to do all the operations and the compliance and they have to also coach and train.
[00:12:51] So over the years, what managing brokers have kind of figured out is, if we have some really great teams, sometimes the teams can help take over some of those responsibilities specifically around training and coaching, right?
[00:13:02] It makes sense. And Eric is a professional coach and trainer and a certified negotiation master trainer. So if I were an agent and I was like, I'm not quite getting the love and training and support that I did at my existing firm, I would be reaching out.
[00:13:18] So definitely reach out to him again. Easiest way is just find them online. You can find them at Eric the agent again. That's E I R I K the agent will have a, I'm sorry, Eric the expert rather Eric the expert Instagram YouTube, etc. We'll have links to that if you are thinking, this is the year for where a lot of agents are moving.
[00:13:34] So I be remiss if I forgot to mention that. But here's what I really wanted to thank you. You're welcome. Here's what I really wanted to ask you while you were talking about collaborative.
[00:13:43] The sort of collaborative training, you know, I was thinking as you go into negotiations or when you go into a deal, I would think that the vast majority of agents who haven't been trained on value proposition are probably just thinking about their own wants and needs and thinking, how do we get what we want without thinking as you were saying sort of understanding the the holistic deal.
[00:14:05] So what does the other side want what are their motivations, what are they willing to sort of negotiate and bend on. And I think that is such an important skill that really isn't hardly taught anywhere.
[00:14:16] It's so true. It is so true. And one of the things that drew me to the real estate negotiation institute and this content is exactly what you just said, this is not something that we are taught in pre licensing.
[00:14:29] Some people bring it from their earlier career, if if if if a real estate is a is a second career for them, but it's not something that we're taught and and frankly to your point, a lot of managing directors and office managers and sales directors and I was a sales director for a long time.
[00:14:45] You're so involved with so many things within each and every deal that it's hard to sit down and have time to really get deep and train on negotiation and buyer psychology and this idea of understanding the other side's needs, not that you're going to guarantee them anything, not that you can guarantee them anything.
[00:15:07] But when we when we integrate the other sides needs into our strategy, this is what Tom Hamin calls, he calls it the enlightened self interest when when I know what the other side wants.
[00:15:20] And I do my best to incorporate their needs, their value elements into trades into exchanges in the deal. I can actually grow a bigger pie and that's the reason my one of my two blogs is called growing the pie.
[00:15:34] Because we're not talking about just a fixed pie of value when we're talking about a real estate transaction, everybody values things differently.
[00:15:43] And if I can identify what the other side wants and needs and identify ways to exchange things of lesser value to me to get things of greater value to me from the other side and do that strategically, I can actually make that pie bigger.
[00:15:58] And I can and I'm not you know, I want the other side to be adequately satisfied. I don't need them to, you know, it's not come by by the fire, right? This is not split the pie 50 50.
[00:16:08] I want them to be adequately satisfied. So I don't deal with the retribution or the entrenchment, the things that come along with putting someone on their heels or rubbing their nose in the dirt or whatever the the imagery is.
[00:16:20] I need to adequately satisfy them. And when I do that, I can actually create more value on my side of the transaction and get more than I would if I were just trying to split that fixed pie.
[00:16:32] Yeah, I agree. And that's a skill set. And it isn't necessarily something that we all just can instinctively inherently know ourselves. It's something there are.
[00:16:42] I study DBT dialectic behavior therapy and there's one of their modules is called interpersonal effectiveness, which is like, okay, what does that really mean?
[00:16:52] It's about having difficult conversations with people. And in real estate, we oftentimes have to have difficult conversations. And it's about how to meet both people's needs.
[00:17:02] But first you have to understand their needs. And I was thinking an example that I'm curious to get your thoughts on would would be I have a buyer.
[00:17:10] We're putting in a contract. Maybe there's a multiple offer situation. And I'm just thinking, well, highest invest is going to win, which maybe most of the time is true, but not always, of course.
[00:17:20] And knowing what the other sides motivations are, knowing what they want from a buyer. And maybe it's just highest invest or maybe it's we put a lot of work into this house.
[00:17:29] We sort of want the next family that comes in to sort of understand and appreciate and respect what we've done, because we want to we want to sort of create a little bit of a legacy here, even with our existing, you know, work that we did with the home.
[00:17:41] So I guess would that be considered part of understanding?
[00:17:44] Absolutely. And I'm, you know, this is this is such a part of who we are as human beings.
[00:17:50] And we forget it sometimes as real estate professionals because we put everything into down payment timeline and and highest price when that is not how every human being thinks.
[00:18:04] In fact, we it's not like, you know, let's say that that you are in a highest invest and it's a million dollar property.
[00:18:10] And you've got a few buyers who are above the asking price at 1.1. But let's say that you are at 1.08 or $20,000 off of the highest bidder.
[00:18:21] But you have made some sort of an appeal that is not price related or down payment related that is that is important to or that lands with that seller.
[00:18:33] It's not that they're giving up 1.1 million dollars. They're making a trade on $20,000.
[00:18:41] And the question is, what is that thing, that connection, the fact that somebody is going to come in and take care of that home, the way that they took care of that home?
[00:18:50] Right. What is that one thing or that as Chris Voss, if we're never split the difference, that he calls those blacks ones, right.
[00:18:58] What does that blacks want? If there's something that I can find out by being ceaselessly curious, by asking questions of the other side that gives me a window into what they really want and what they really value, then they they might be happy to give up $20,000 to satisfy that need, that value element that's important to them.
[00:19:20] So we often mistake this idea that the price is the only thing that matters.
[00:19:28] Or if I'm not 100% if I'm not all cash, I can't compete. It's just not true. If we can understand if we can start with the other side and uncover those blacks ones, understand those value elements.
[00:19:41] So that's a great example.
[00:19:42] Well, thank you. And I was, it's just the first thing that came to mind, but I was thinking, you know, you're, you're sort of further example of, you know, being $20,000 under highest invest and still possibly winning the deal.
[00:19:56] It's really an important thing because most times the other side isn't going to be able to go out and spend that $20,000 as cash.
[00:20:02] It's probably just going into the next property and you know odds are there may even be a mortgage on the file on the next property.
[00:20:09] So that's just all going into, you know, an extra $50 a month or something in payment. It's kind of a really a nothing.
[00:20:17] If it's only looked at as highest invest, then yeah, maybe that's maybe that that will make the difference.
[00:20:21] But understanding that, you know, yeah, we're coming in a little bit under, but I sort of have an idea of what the owner wants and, you know, and being able to meet their needs in a different way.
[00:20:31] And still get your clients a little bit less than, than maybe, you know, what, what everyone else would have paid.
[00:20:36] I love, I love all of this. Again, to me, these are all skills. And we are not taught about these in high school.
[00:20:42] I didn't learn them in college. I had to study persuasion and understanding rapport and understanding how to, you know, how, how to listen and how to, you know, sort of extract information, you know, in an elegant way from the people I'm chatting with.
[00:20:57] So I would, I would love to, but actually before before we go any further, I would, because you are a coach, you lead a team, you're also practicing yourself and you teach at a national level.
[00:21:10] This is a tough year for, for REALTORS. I did meet somebody last night at a party, one of the top agents here in Chicago, who said he's up 50%. And he's the only person I know.
[00:21:19] Everyone else is pretty much struggling, who's been in the business long enough. And we were laughing. And he's like, yeah, I know everyone hates me because, you know, they, they, everyone else is down. But, but it is a tough year.
[00:21:28] I think for a lot of us. And rates are up inventories down. And I know in New York, it's, it's really tough with inventory. So what, what are you doing to keep or what are you telling your students, as well as your teammates to sort of keep them motivated.
[00:21:42] And, and, you know, moving forward when it's so easy to just to kind of go like, oh, this is just hard right now.
[00:21:49] Yeah, I really do believe that we have to have these conversations with ourselves about how are we going to move from where we are right now to a market that we know is going to get better.
[00:22:00] Right. So first thing is to understand that this where we are right now is temporary. The question is, can you last through that time?
[00:22:10] Is that an easy thing for you or is that a hard thing for you? Are you at, on your last dollar and, and not earning a living for another three months, if you're not doing deals, is that going to crush you?
[00:22:21] If it is, then let's either put a plan together so that you can find a different way to maneuver through this industry. Are you, you know, are you, are you doing rental deals rather than sales deals? Are you working on the, the sell side versus the buy side, right?
[00:22:34] Are there things that we can do to help you on a different path than you're on right now, right? And then there are other agents who are like, yeah, I know I'm going to survive this. It's not an issue whether I'm going to survive this.
[00:22:45] It's a matter of how long this is going to be and what do I do in the meantime? And so what I tell the agents is, first of all, there is, and this is a almost cliche because so many people are saying it, but it's absolutely true.
[00:22:57] This idea that this is a skills based market, right? I've, you know, I've been listening to some of your other podcasts and we're, you know, you're talking about that, you know, people running through 2021 and part of 2022, you know, you could just throw a, you know, a sign in a yard.
[00:23:14] And you've got 30 people making offers, right? It was a market that did not require as much skill, certainly required skill, but didn't require as much skill as the market that we're in now right now.
[00:23:26] Not only are you competing to get that next listing and find that next buyer if you're on the listing side, but you're competing with a smaller amount of business and agents all fighting for that business.
[00:23:40] So how are you going to get a bigger piece to your point, this agent who's up 50%. How do you get a bigger piece of a shrinking pie? And that's where you need to really focus your energy in my opinion is, if you go through, you've already figured out, look, this, this isn't, this is a big piece of a, you know,
[00:23:56] this, this industry right now where we are, it's not going to kill me. It's not going to take me down. So I know that I can make it through it. Now the question is, what do you do with this time? And if you can focus on getting a bigger slice of that shrinking pie, that's, that's going to give you a goal to actually maneuver towards or move towards.
[00:24:14] So you start doing things like understanding in a more deep and and and higher level way, the idea of negotiation of buyer psychology of, of actually going into those pitches.
[00:24:29] And instead of getting one out of three or one out of two, you're getting every one. How are you going to increase your odds of getting each deal? How are you going to build loyalty with each and every buyer so that they end up being a deal rather than losing buyers here and there as you might be accustomed to doing.
[00:24:49] So how do you maximize the business that you do have and make sure that you win each and every time, right, this goes, and this goes back to the highest and best too. They're going to still be highest and best.
[00:25:02] But if you're more prepared or if you're, if you can prepare your buyers better, you're going to find yourself on the winning side of that highest and best more often than on the losing side. And my one of my old bosses used to call this spilling milk, right.
[00:25:16] When we're busy, when we have a lot going on and we're just trying to keep every keep everything, you know, in our hands as we run forward, we are spilling milk left and right, but we don't really care about the milk that spills because by the end of the time we're stop running, we still have enough milk to drink, right.
[00:25:33] We're just constantly going, going, going. Well, in a market that we're in right now, we don't want to spill milk. We want to make sure that we have as much milk, there may be less milk in the glass to begin with.
[00:25:45] So we don't want to lose more milk and we can end that same journey with the same amount of milk. We just haven't spilled a lot of it. And that's what that's what I usually teach people in this market is look, let's figure out how you're going to make it to the next level because there will be another great market on the other side of this.
[00:25:59] But we do need to enhance our skills and create an environment where we win more often.
[00:26:07] I agree. And I think this is the time to really focus on skill based activities because number one, most agents have a little bit more time to spend sharpening their skill set, their tools.
[00:26:19] And also this is a time where human nature for the most, for the majority of us and I'm in the same category. So I'm not saying that this is a negative. It's just human nature is to want to when things aren't as well, maybe retreat a little bit.
[00:26:36] And I end, you know, do less activity because maybe we're a little bummed out or or so. So this is the, these are the times where you might have to force yourself to do a little bit more activity, but understanding that you're really doing your future self a huge favor by doing things today.
[00:26:51] And most agents are not most agents. I don't know what percentage of agents have have reduced their activity. But you know, I just know that when, when things are tough, you know, it's easier to not go into action. And so this is the time to get an accountability partner, get a coach, you know, and really work on those skills and those habits so that, you know, what you're doing today, a year, a year and a half from now will start to yield fruit or however long, you know, the sale cycle is.
[00:27:18] And to add to that, you know, I think that oftentimes when we when we do find ourselves here where we're retreating, like you said, we're doing a little bit less, a little bit less work than we know that we should be doing at the time.
[00:27:34] Sometimes the reaction to that from a lot of coaches in our industry or a lot of managers is to tell you the things that you need to do.
[00:27:45] And oftentimes they highlight the things that you are least likely to want to do, right. So they basically say, these are things you're not doing. And this is why you're not not successful.
[00:27:56] So you got to get out there and do all those things that you don't like to do because that's the way that you're going to break this cycle.
[00:28:02] Where I, you know, certainly we have to do things that we don't want to do, especially if we're sitting on a couch and we find ourselves not working as hard as we should be working.
[00:28:12] But my approach is a little different. I want to identify the things that you love to do. And you may have found that your real estate career for two years, you're running around like a chicken with your head cut off.
[00:28:23] So you're just trying to just get to the next place and do the next deal. And you forget about what you love about this business, what you love about people, what you love about your knowledge, what you know, all the things that make this an attractive business.
[00:28:39] So my approach is to sit down and say, let's start with the things that you love and do a lot more of that.
[00:28:46] So I'd rather you do 100% more of something that you love than struggle to do 25% more of something you don't like. And it doesn't have to be.
[00:28:56] Yeah, I want to pause you for a second because that is such a wise, a wise wise statement doing more about what you, especially when you're in a more difficult position like we know a lot of agents are this year.
[00:29:07] Yes, we know it's a little bit of a bummer right now. And it's easy to retreat. So what we call it in DBT stacking positives do the things that you already like to do.
[00:29:18] And here's why and I'm not I'm not trying to tell teach Eric anything. Obviously here.
[00:29:23] I love this. Well, the only reason I mentioned is I was just I just learned the so gallup, the people who do lots of polling, their big polling company is a lot of people know they have this strength and weakness finder.
[00:29:34] And we had a professor from from Northwestern come in who's trained and she assessed our strengths and weaknesses. And I think there was 38 of them.
[00:29:42] And she goes, whatever you were your bottom five are don't even try to improve those because she's like the data is really, really clear that you can't you can't it's not how you're wired. It's really you maybe can make them incrementally better.
[00:29:55] But just like for example her most her biggest weakness was empathy. And she goes, it's kind of funny. I wish I was empathic. I'm just not tell I'm built.
[00:30:05] So I don't try to pretend that I'm empathic. I try to focus on all the other positives things that I do have a strength. She goes, so if you come to me for empathy, you're probably not going to get what you need.
[00:30:15] But she goes, my partner happens is very high in empathy. And so she sort of balances her her wife balances it out. But the point is is know what your strengths are know what you like to do because you're right.
[00:30:28] It's much easier to get into action with the things that you want to do and you like doing. And then you can build from there.
[00:30:34] Exactly. You know, it's funny. The strength finder the gallop strengths.
[00:30:40] Their system my brother and I are building online content for my coaching company. And he's a certified gallop strengths.
[00:30:48] Oh, that's funny. Oh, what a small world. Yeah.
[00:30:51] The great. It's a great assessment. And they're right on. I mean this idea of of not doing the things that you don't excel at.
[00:30:59] But understanding, and this is great for interpersonal relationships too as well. Right. I mean when you when you are a manager or a coach or a team leader or just an agent having interactions with clients.
[00:31:11] When you can look across and identify when you know what your strengths are.
[00:31:15] And you can start to identify potential strengths or strengths that the other side has.
[00:31:21] Then you start making connections or if they have different sets of strengths, you then can understand why.
[00:31:28] You know, if you've got somebody who's low on empathy or empathy is one of their lowest strengths.
[00:31:32] You can start to understand then why or how you need to communicate with them in order to have a more successful relationship rather than always budding heads because your strengths are completely different.
[00:31:43] Yeah, it makes sense. And also like you were saying assessing the other person, especially like during presentations.
[00:31:50] You talked about buyer and seller presentations. And I think so many of us think about first, okay, we got to learn a script.
[00:31:57] We got to know what we're going to do when we get there. And we're probably realistically.
[00:32:01] We're probably doing the same kind of pitch every single time because we we we've committed to memory.
[00:32:08] We've done it hundreds of times. Maybe if we've been in the business long enough and it has a certain success level and we're like, hey, I do close one out of every three listing presentations.
[00:32:17] I do. But if you're doing the same exact listing presentation each time, there's probably a missed opportunity there to get some feedback from the person on the other side of the table.
[00:32:27] And then adjust your your strategy to better meet that person's needs, which probably means not doing the same presentation in exactly the way every single time.
[00:32:38] 100% and this I actually have a course that I teach through our archway partners called the decision makers.
[00:32:44] And it's all about so going back to the first thing we talked about, which is starting with the other side identifying the other sides needs.
[00:32:52] What it what it who are they right so when we do a value proposition, we have to separate that make a huge distinction between what value proposition is and what a pitch is right.
[00:33:03] We do a listings pitch we call it listings pitch. It's really a value proposition. The pitch is something you give an elevator. It's generic.
[00:33:11] It could be to anybody right. It's that thing that sells your product or service the best.
[00:33:15] Whereas a value proposition is something a little bit or vastly different in that value proposition must be in order for it to be at its most effective.
[00:33:27] It must be tailored to the decision maker to whom you are pitching.
[00:33:32] So are they an assertive driver are they a collaborative feeler are they an expressive humanist are they an analytic thinker what type of buyer is this or decision maker is this.
[00:33:46] And how are they best influenced right are they data driven do they love stories and this is a huge aha I think for any negotiator is that when you go in and you you've tailored that pitch you know exactly what you're going to say when you're going to say it.
[00:34:03] It's basically a script you're forgetting the most important part who the client is right who are they and when you if you can hone that skill of identifying different buyer types are different as I call them decision maker types.
[00:34:19] You are going to find these all of these new doors open up and now you have this menu of benefits and just like looking at a menu in a in a restaurant you can start to pick the five the six benefits that convey the most utility to that specific decision maker.
[00:34:36] And you will find that your hit rate your success rate is off the charts because now you're the person across the table feels like you're speaking directly to them and that you've got a window into their heart their mind their soul whatever you know you're just so much more impactful and persuasive when you know who you're who it is that you're dealing with it and it's more intimate and what I mean intimate I mean connecting because you have taken feedback from the other person you are that.
[00:35:06] And then processing that yourself and making adjustments to fit that person's world view their beliefs etc their their their values and and I am I think you know if we think about this because I hear REALTORS talk about this all the time which is I don't like selling to a certain type of individual I don't like selling to an analytic person because all they want is the numbers it's not emotional other people love it my point is is what if you could learn how to speak their language.
[00:35:36] You you you maybe you'd enjoy working with those agent or those clients more but more importantly maybe you just be more effective at it which means you close more deals whether you like it or not you're still going to come across people who aren't the same sort of way the process information make decisions like you were saying the decision making sort of understanding the decision makers and the strategies and then it wouldn't be cool to go into a listing presentation by a presentation having like five or six different styles of pitches and then knowing oh this is this kind of.
[00:36:06] I think I'm going to push the conversation more towards this because I know that this tends to sort of you know tickle the ivories of that particular you know thought process of that individual that is an incredible power as opposed to just going it's another one of these analytics people I don't know how to do this.
[00:36:23] 100% you're absolutely right and in coaching we call that flexing right so I can flex my approach to meet that person where they are it's not they're not being a jerk.
[00:36:35] You know whatever label we put on them there are jerk they're irrational they're they're crazy you know we put all of these labels on people because we don't know how to connect.
[00:36:48] So what you're saying is absolutely right if we can flex our approach and go okay this is an assertive driver they don't want to have a personal relationship with me they're not going to ask me about my family and my kids and where I went to college if they do ask me where I went to college it's going to be to that whether they believe the coach.
[00:37:05] The college that I went to is suitable for their needs right and if I can if if I understand that about them they're not mean they come off as your typical negotiator very competitive negotiator but they are intr everybody acts in their own interests and their interest is to hire the person that they believe is going to do the best possible job for them they don't want a shrinking violet they don't want somebody who's going to wind around telling stories or or or
[00:37:34] use pufferier BS them on on on the answer to a question they don't know they want you to be direct they'd rather you say you know what that's a great question I don't know the answer or that's a great question I know that you're going to want specifics you're going to want details I understand that so before I answer the question let me get you the specifics and the details that I know that you want so that I can give you an answer that's going to be that's going to satisfy your needs.
[00:38:02] Imagine if our agent said that to us we're a buyer or seller and we're an analytic and our agent said that to us it would be like music to our ears and now all of a sudden that trust component is going through the roof when you didn't think you could build trust for that person at all you didn't think they would trust anybody and now all the sudden you've connected with them on their level and so now they start to that trust factor starts to go up and up and up and you change the relationship.
[00:38:31] Yeah you just gave such a really specifically excellent example in my opinion because this idea of like you're just using analytic people is you know saying to them on hey I understand you process information this particular way I know you like a lot of information that's important for you to make a decision therefore I need to go back and put together this information in a way that's exactly how you want to see it so you can then take it digest it and people who are analytic under such a way that's going to be a good question.
[00:39:01] I understand that putting that data together takes time so it actually gives you on the other side of the deal a lot less pressure to come up with the answer right then in there which probably isn't going to be sufficient to satisfy their curiosity because unless you're just an encyclopedia of information and you're able to present it in the way that they want but probably they want to look at something they probably want to hold hold or at least look on a screen and see that you put some work in so they can be like this person speaks my language it's actually brilliant because it's a win win for us.
[00:39:31] Everybody it's it gets lets you off the hook a little bit to feel like oh god I don't know the answer right now you're going to you know and you're going to say it to them in a way which most of the time they're going to go hey that makes sense just get it to me in the next you know day or two and that would be you know I'll digest it.
[00:39:46] 100% and DJ you said like the the thing you said about there they'll want the time to go through the data the research that you prepare and and this is where those these these moments where we understand that there's a different way of doing things.
[00:40:01] So if you're going to get these things you know what they're going to do is come from right so we if we are the kind of person where we're like well I want to get every I feel like I need to get everything to them immediately right now so if I say I'm going to take some time I'm afraid they're going to be upset with me well if you really understand an analytic thinker then you'll know that they're very slow to make decisions once they make a decision they commit to it and they're full bore but they want to take that extra time in fact what I say to to people who take my decision makers class we're talking about how to influence a
[00:40:30] analytic thinker you say you if you're if you're going to meet with them at noon don't met don't plan a 2 p.m. meeting you're going to meet with them at three ask them if they want to go out to dinner after your three hour meeting don't plan something an hour after you have a meeting with an analytic thinker because you're going to end up in the last 15 minutes of that meeting whether it's an hour later or two hours later going oh my god how am I going to get to my next appointment you're going to start to rush them site you know subconsciously because you're rushed and
[00:41:00] then you ruin ruin all the relationship building and all the trust that you've been building for two hours goes out the window because you got to get out the door to another appointment so if you're going to meet with an analytic thinker set the entire morning
[00:41:13] aside or set the entire afternoon aside they may not need it but you're not going to ever feel like you are rushing them to a decision and and to your point that with the data they will accept the fact that you need time to put together the data
[00:41:26] and the research and the way that they want to view it and the way they want to consume it and if they believe that we're on a tighter timeline they will let you know
[00:41:35] absolutely and these are these are things that again we know our own world view we know our own processes for making this or some of us know and others of us maybe aren't
[00:41:45] aren't included to our own ways in which we we make decisions but this is really a skill set and a knowledge set that you need to
[00:41:54] consider adding because it's only going to make every interaction you have with a client or the other side of a transaction go hopefully more smoothly because you're going to be able to identify
[00:42:08] there's key identifiers in the way people speak in the in the way they reveal themselves to you which sometimes is conscious versus unconscious there's
[00:42:15] there's lots of cues that somebody who is trained on how to identify these cues verbal cues non-verbal cues
[00:42:22] that that we can actually start to paint a picture maybe without the person even necessarily being fully aware that we're putting them in a category
[00:42:32] we're doing it because that's that's how human beings classify things but it's how we make it's how we can make adjustments and say oh
[00:42:39] this person's starting to fall into this category I'm getting a better sense of what they may want to see or hear
[00:42:45] so all of this is it's all skills and these are things that I can almost assure you
[00:42:50] you probably haven't been taught unless you have sorted out on your own and so this is a great point to to remind everyone who's listening
[00:42:57] if you're an agent in the New York area and you're looking for a team with this kind of information that they can impart to you
[00:43:04] or if you're an agent from anywhere in the country that's looking to get some coaching Eric would love the
[00:43:09] opportunity to speak with you is coaching companies archway partners Inc and of course his
[00:43:14] his team over at Browns Harris Stevens is always looking for agents in the area to possibly join up on the
[00:43:19] team as well so please check those two places out um Eric I wanted to ask you to about
[00:43:27] what what do you what where there now actors are taught how to do this I in your backgrounds and acting
[00:43:34] so I know there's you know there's different styles of or different philosophies of acting there's
[00:43:41] sort of the strawspurg I only know a couple I'm not an actor but there's a strawspurg method there's
[00:43:45] there's method acting I think that's a russburg but there's uh Uda Hagen there's there's a few of them
[00:43:50] that you guys you're some good polls right here uh you know I'm yeah well my knowledge is is uh is very
[00:43:58] shallow so I know that's it that's all I know I don't know how to do any of it but but this is important
[00:44:02] because I was listening to some actors talking about how they really uh pay a lot of attention
[00:44:09] to the other actors in the scene to then get cues on how to then react what to do with their hands
[00:44:16] what to just how to sort of be in the scene but really sort of memorizing their own lines if
[00:44:22] they have them to then forget them so that they can be present for whatever's going on in the scene
[00:44:27] and understanding that there's an interpersonal play between the actors who are you know not just
[00:44:32] reciting lines and walking here and there when they're supposed to yeah absolutely don't now keep in
[00:44:38] mind I'm a real estate agent so you know you may not want to trust my acting advice because it didn't
[00:44:44] work out so well for me but no you're absolutely right they you know we always say acting is reacting
[00:44:49] right and this is the same thing this is one of the skills I think why you see a lot of actors who
[00:44:55] who end up in the real estate world because one of the attributes one of the skills they bring
[00:45:00] to this career is being able to read people or being able to react um to people in a
[00:45:08] moment and and that's there is a skill to that so certainly I think that um you know one of my one
[00:45:14] of my junior agents on my team runs a women's improv company this woman so so she she's spent
[00:45:21] a many many years she was an actress and a singer and now she runs an improv company well her this
[00:45:29] idea of she loves role playing so when we are when we're talking and we're working through a situation
[00:45:35] she's working with a with a client and um she's looking for some advice I will present some
[00:45:41] options for her some ideas you know it's for her and say what do you think what would you do
[00:45:46] and so we'll work through that and then what you'll always want to do after we've settled on what
[00:45:52] we think the next move is she'll say okay let me workshop this with you and then she'll go
[00:45:57] and she'll tell me how she's gonna say it when she gets on the phone or in person with the
[00:46:01] client or the co-broker or whoever it is so she's constantly role playing so that it sets it sits
[00:46:09] and it and it and it um sinks in for her so there and a lot of people I would say that you know
[00:46:15] I'm a big fan of role playing in my in my negotiation courses we end the certified negotiation
[00:46:21] expert the core concepts course with a with a big role play we role play a deal right I got
[00:46:26] buyers agents and listing agents they get there all the the um the backstory of their client they
[00:46:33] know that we uh subject property specifics and all the comps and we have them negotiate a deal and
[00:46:40] it's it's that how we culminate all of this it's the culmination of all of the learning in this
[00:46:44] course so I'm a big fan of role playing but if you if you are someone who knows an actor in real
[00:46:56] fear comfort zone and this is when we talk about the at-bats right you're gonna hit more singles
[00:47:02] hit more home runs hit more doubles you're gonna hit more if you have been practicing before you step
[00:47:09] up to the plate right that is just that's just something we all know if our prepared to have
[00:47:16] that conversation to deal with the objections all of that stuff if we're prepared when we get into a
[00:47:21] real life scenario because we've been role playing our rate of success or our likelihood of success
[00:47:27] goes up significantly so I I would highly recommend to anybody any of your listeners if you're not
[00:47:35] role playing if you don't have an accountability partner or a manager that will help you role play
[00:47:40] through scenarios um well first of all take my class uh and then you'll be in the whole um
[00:47:46] reny advantage facebook community and you can role play with other certified negotiation experts
[00:47:51] but it's a big big help to be able to to flex that muscle and to practice
[00:47:57] yeah and role playing to me is you know really the only way I know to practice it because it's it's
[00:48:04] funny we we were just practicing we were getting media trained at our local association here
[00:48:09] because I serve on some committees and occasionally we are asked to do media uh interviews and
[00:48:15] things so and and I was like oh I do podcasts I know I know how to do this and so they gave us some
[00:48:21] tips and some things and and I went okay I kind of know all that and then we role played and I sat
[00:48:27] with a fake reporter who was uh uh uh pretty I was on on screen for like a tv spot and I said
[00:48:35] I don't need to practice this I got it I know how to talk I can I can be us my way through this and
[00:48:40] about 30 seconds in I was like oh my god I did not prepare it any at all for this I am out of
[00:48:46] things to say I thought I could wing it and I've done 500 of these episodes doesn't mean I'm a good
[00:48:51] inherently a good interviewer or good interviewee but I certainly was like oh that's right you
[00:48:57] got to practice so practicing is everything so even if you're as Eric is 17 years in the business
[00:49:03] role playing is still great because it'll it'll force you to do the things that you're not very
[00:49:07] good at um and and cause you to as as you said move outside of your ex uh your your um your comfort zone
[00:49:13] I also want to mention one other just practical as I'm a marketer so I wanted to mention why I think
[00:49:19] the certified negotiation expert is from a marketing perspective and from a skills-based
[00:49:25] perspective it's it's an absolute win but even if you're just looking at it as from a marketing
[00:49:29] perspective as far as all the designations go and there's lots of wonderful ones I'm not saying one
[00:49:34] is any better than another but I and I shouldn't say but and um I do think the certified negotiation
[00:49:41] expert designation is a very marketable one because it allows you to actually say hey I've got
[00:49:47] this thing and only maybe 1% of all the REALTORS in the country have it or whatever the percentages
[00:49:52] it's not much higher than 1% I suspect so it allows you to really differentiate yourself to
[00:49:57] arguably one of the most important uh skills in the game of being a real estate agent which is of
[00:50:04] course negotiation so being able to communicate that to a client um and say hey it's something that
[00:50:10] they can understand without knowing anything about our our industry and so there's just a really
[00:50:15] nice it's very on the nose it's exactly what it is I am a negotiation expert and um then you can
[00:50:22] actually talk about it in a way where I think it will help sort of differentiate yourself from
[00:50:27] from other other agents here that's right and and and you're you it sounds like you were in you've
[00:50:32] been in my class because that's exactly how we describe it right and in some cases the biggest
[00:50:39] value that some agents get out of my class and I and I think there's so many there's so much value
[00:50:44] in it there's so many things that you can that you can take from this class whether you've been an
[00:50:49] agent in the business for three decades or three months it's a class that that is accessible
[00:50:55] for new agents but it's also high level for those who have been negotiating for for several years
[00:51:01] but sometimes what um my agents get out of the class is a new way to your exact point PJ a new way
[00:51:10] to um to convey this information to their client to have the conversation to to um
[00:51:19] explain how they strategize and how they work through negotiations so that your client knows
[00:51:26] when they're no longer in the room when they're no longer standing next to you that you are
[00:51:32] going to be advocating for them that you are going to be um cooperative as you mentioned earlier
[00:51:38] cooperative but assertive that you have a plan in place and that you're going to be able to
[00:51:43] execute on that plan so just being able to convey your strategy to a client in a in a in a
[00:51:49] sound um a cogent effective way is very very important but um but but this I mean this
[00:51:57] the this the CNE designation the logo is also just a door opener right so when they see it it's in
[00:52:04] your marketing materials it's in your auto signature now you can have a conversation it brings up the
[00:52:09] idea of negotiation and now you can highlight the importance and what studies show is
[00:52:16] negotiation skills are more important to our clients than marketing than market analysis it is
[00:52:21] the highest skill that we can provide our our our clients now uh in practice it's one of the
[00:52:28] we score slower than most anything in negotiation skills in the eyes of our client and that's where
[00:52:35] there's this opportunity if you can learn this skill if you can master this skill you will separate
[00:52:41] yourself from you know to your point 98% of the agents in the in this country I think too this
[00:52:48] other I was thinking as you were saying this that why why is the negotiation part so critical and
[00:52:55] I I think obviously it's because it's about money usually but um and it's about the transaction
[00:53:01] and winning winning the deal or earning the deal however I was also thinking um maybe the certified
[00:53:08] negotiation expert uh sort of skill set comes really into play when a transaction gets tough
[00:53:14] because I I would assume that the vast majority of the most stressful moments the most emotionally
[00:53:20] trying parts of a transaction have got to be during the negotiation because there there could be a
[00:53:25] time where the deal might fall apart or feels like it might fall apart the client might be freaking
[00:53:30] out going oh my god I maybe I'm making the wrong decision maybe I'm giving up too much me so that
[00:53:34] that's probably a highly stressful time emotionally it's the least fun time I would think for the
[00:53:41] client usually unless maybe you're on the list side I guess maybe you know if you're selling a
[00:53:45] property maybe it's a little bit more fun but on the buy side certainly it's tough and so I was just
[00:53:50] thinking I bet those skills come into play to help calm everything down as you're going through
[00:53:55] the stressful times you're right you're right and and we we talk about the this comes out of the
[00:54:00] book getting to yes is William Yuri and Roger Fisher who wrote one of the seminal works in
[00:54:06] collaborative negotiation the book called getting to yes and they talk about this what's called the
[00:54:10] Sam model and you know this the S is the stand it's where we positionally bargain it's where we
[00:54:16] you know it's no I won't yes yes you will no I won't it's the stand that we all take to not be
[00:54:22] moved off of our position we don't want to be thrown one direction or another so we anchor in we
[00:54:28] put we take a stand I will not sell my apartment for less than seven hundred thousand dollars
[00:54:32] come hell or high water that's a stand right I need to understand what the area actual area of
[00:54:38] concern is and what is emotionally driving this this stand right so that's the S a and M the
[00:54:45] stand the area of concern and the emotional motivators the M so you're right it's about understanding
[00:54:52] people it's about when at that when they're at their most anxious they're most frustrated it's not
[00:54:58] getting caught in positional bargaining but understanding what their actual area of concern is by
[00:55:04] asking questions and then it's about communication and offering options people do not like to be
[00:55:12] backed into a corner they don't like to feel like they're backed into a corner they want options and
[00:55:17] at the hardest moment of the deal when you're communicating well with your client and you are
[00:55:23] looking at all the value elements that could be a possible way to get successfully get the transaction
[00:55:29] done when you've identified what we call as Harvard calls your baton or your best alternative to
[00:55:35] a negotiated agreement if you have a strong baton if you have a which is plan B right if you have a
[00:55:41] strong plan B and you're communicating and you're providing options now your client feels empowered
[00:55:47] and instead of feeling like they're backed into a corner or like they have no options now you make
[00:55:53] them feel like hey if this doesn't work out it's going to be because we didn't meet our minimum goals
[00:56:00] so if plan A is not going to work for us let's move on to plan B as opposed to getting into
[00:56:06] highest invest after highest invest and feeling like you're just like a rag doll getting thrown around
[00:56:12] we have the power to help our clients remain resilient and empowered and we do that by
[00:56:19] communicating with them in the hardest of times in the deal just like you said and having like you
[00:56:24] said having options and also you said something very very profound that I want to make sure our audience
[00:56:32] noticed if not I'm going to step on it a little bit in a good way. There's a skill at DBT we
[00:56:40] call it cope ahead I almost forgot it and basically if this doesn't go the way we want here is what
[00:56:46] we will do and getting their buy-in client buy-in hey does this make sense you know I'm sure you're
[00:56:52] getting buy-ins all the time but saying here's what we're going to try here's what we're going to do
[00:56:56] here's why we think it will work if it doesn't here's another alternative that we are going here's
[00:57:01] our plan B and and even just having a plan B is very empowering because all of a sudden now
[00:57:08] when option A doesn't work out no big deal we've got option B and and it's it's most agents I think
[00:57:15] I don't know I shouldn't speak for any other agents but I think a lot of agents probably don't have
[00:57:20] a plan B you know when they're putting offers in they have it or if they have one maybe they
[00:57:26] haven't effectively communicated it to the client because they go I don't really want my client to
[00:57:30] think that planning might not work so I just gonna I'm gonna mention if it doesn't if it does
[00:57:33] it I'll deal with it when it happens that's probably not a strong strategy because there are
[00:57:40] going to be times when you obviously when you don't get what you want and and making sure that the
[00:57:44] client already knows we have another option here that that is profound and I'm really really
[00:57:50] glad that you said that these are all skills again this is this is a skills-based conversation
[00:57:55] and we're focusing a lot on it because guys skills win the game the fundamentals win the game
[00:58:02] so these are all things you can learn that's the best part you don't have to be good at it
[00:58:06] you just have to be willing to to practice and Eric you know he can teach you in a number of
[00:58:12] different ways if you're an agent in New York City consider joining his team at Brown Harris
[00:58:16] Stevens I mean he'll teach it to you one-on-one he also if you're not in the New York City area
[00:58:20] which of course most of our audience is not he can teach you any any time so you can visit his
[00:58:26] website archway partners Inc I'm gonna have links to all of this and you can become one of his
[00:58:31] coaching clients and also you should consider getting your certified negotiation expert certification
[00:58:36] which you can do at at Renny and we will have a link to the Renny website so that so that you can
[00:58:44] see when their classes are available you can take one from Eric but Eric I think this is a great
[00:58:50] place to stop because I could talk to you all day and you don't have all day to speak to me
[00:58:54] now I love this thank you so much DJ this is this is so great oh this was so much fun for me this is
[00:58:59] I would not say that I have necessarily the skills you're talking about however I appreciate that
[00:59:06] those are skills that any one of us can learn and we should consider learning those and these are
[00:59:11] the soft skills that really can can win the game push the ball over that one yard line and they're
[00:59:18] they might even feel a little bit like magic once you learn them because you're going to be
[00:59:22] unlocking things that are invisible to other people and when you learn to unlock what's the invisible
[00:59:28] which becomes visible to you it just be I think everything just becomes more fun and your
[00:59:34] your hit rate is going to go up your success rate is going to improve your clients will be happy
[00:59:39] or it's really it just makes it'll make your life a little bit less hard so if it's if you're not
[00:59:45] going to be motivated to do it because how exciting it is think about just reducing the stress and
[00:59:50] anxiety in your life this will allow you to do that so consider one way or the other getting
[00:59:55] your C&E certification for whatever your motivation strategy is but this is the time to level up our
[01:00:01] skills a lot of agents are leaving the industry a lot of agents are pulling back on their efforts
[01:00:06] because you know they're maybe a little bummed out now's the time to to find that grit within us
[01:00:11] and and and do something fun do something fun like learn a new skill do some of the activities as
[01:00:17] Eric said that you do enjoy doing just to sort of get you up and up and Adam and then consider
[01:00:23] adding in some of these skills and and let's let's all get a coach this year let's let's let's

[01:00:40] need one to let's get one and even if you can't afford it you know consider finding a way to

So you don't have to remember how to spell Eric in the show notes. Eric, welcome to the show. Hey, DJ, thank you so much. Thank you for all of the plugs. And it's a pleasure to be here. I'm looking forward to our conversation. So thanks for having me. Well, I am looking forward to it as well. I would like to start, I guess at the start. So I do that with almost all of our guests, but I am really interested, especially with somebody who's been in real estate for almost 20 years now. How did you get in and why? Well, I love telling the story and many like many of your guests as I listened to your podcasts, you know, there's. It seems like we all have these strange ways of finding real estate. You know, it's not something that that seems like is the beginning of our path as we grow up and go through school and into college. So I actually moved to New York City to be an actor back in 1998 after graduating from college and starting a theater company in Minneapolis before moving to New York. So I had dreams of becoming an actor. I was an actor in New York for about 10 years. I did the tour thing and I did regional theater and commercials and voice overwork. And then I met my wife and doing a regional theater job in Roanoke, Virginia. She was a dancer. I was a character actor and a singer. And shortly after that, I think I realized that the theater world gave me what it was going to give me and I found my wife. And I needed to make a change. I was not a successful actor. I was not making a great living doing it. And so shortly after getting married, I was recovering from a knee injury from knee surgery and I was tempting. I couldn't work in restaurants anymore because of my knee. I was not acting. And I met somebody who was at a temp job, but was also taking phone calls for real estate. He's the first person that actually gave me a real kind of behind the scenes or under the hood look at what real estate was. Without sugar coating it, without making it into this fantasy. And he said, look, you see, I'm here at this temp job because sometimes, you know, the money is flowing and sometimes it's not. I'm trying to go to law school. And so you do what you have to do. But here are the skills required and here's what would make a real estate professional. And I left that temp job thinking, I think this is something I would be good at. And so the next week, I signed up for pre licensing in New York. The pre licensing process is ridiculously easy. It's a little bit harder now than it was, but it was a couple hundred dollars and 45 hours worth of classroom work and then taking your tests. So two weeks later, there I am. I'm a licensed real estate professional looking for a brokerage. And I was lucky enough to align myself with a company, a small company that was really good at helping generate and acquire leads for their agents. So I didn't have to do the whole Craigslist thing, getting my own leads. And I was able to hone my craft working with a lot of clients because I was given opportunities. I was given at bats, as we say. And so I spent 10 years at that company, 10 years at that firm before then leaping and going back into brokerage after being a director of sales and development for five years. So I grew with that firm. They were a small firm and I grew that firm in management and then went back into the field as an agent. And then shortly after that, I was introduced to the real estate negotiation institute. So I had 10 years of experience in the business and I took a continuing education course on collaborative negotiation through this company, the real estate negotiation institute. And I left that class completely blown away, blown away by the content blown away by these, the style of the teaching blown away by everything. And I shortly thereafter contacted Tom Haman, who's the founder and CEO of the real estate negotiation institute and said, I think I need to coach for you. I think I need to be an instructor. So I so that started my journey being a master certified negotiation expert and a national instructor for the real estate negotiation institute, which I've been doing now for almost eight years, while also having a full time real estate practice at Brown Harris students. Wow, and we should mention too that you have a coaching company for real estate agents archway partners, ink. Tell us tell us a little bit about that. Well, it's interesting Mike. I was doing when I teach my courses, my negotiation courses, I always inevitably have a few agents who wants some additional coaching, who wants some additional help. And what I started doing was doing more mentorship, consulting, I called it coaching, and it wasn't. And it wasn't until I went on the journey of actually going through a coaching program, I went through a program that coach you for several months, and then got my own mentor coach, so that I could really learn what it is to coach, what it is to walk alongside someone, support them. And be more of an accountability partner and a support for them in their journey. What is it that they want to achieve? What is it that they want to do with their real estate career? What are your core values? Where have you been? Where are you and where do you want to go? And when I really started to understand my role as a coach, it became this beautiful marriage because what we talk about in the certified negotiation expert designation courses. Is this idea of value proposition, right? The cost benefit analysis. And what are your benefits? How do you develop that value proposition? How do you understand what you have to offer any decision maker, any purchaser, any landlord, right? So that's our jumping off point. That's our tangent point, the value proposition. And when we look at that through a coaching lens, there are so many places we can go with that when we understand who we are, when we understand what we offer, and then how do we tailor that to each and every client. So that's where archway partners, you know, the idea of the of the archway, the doorway and walking through to new possibilities came from and now I've had my coaching company for about 18 months now. That's incredible. Congratulations on that. I was I was thinking if I were an agent in New York City, one of the and really anywhere, but specifically because you practice in New York City. And I want to talk about what the benefits are to becoming a certified negotiation expert and why collaborative cooperation is really a sorry collaborative. I apologize for the term that you use that I. I'll get cooperation fits right in there. So yeah, I was thinking a couple of things I want to talk about with that because you sort of spark something that I hadn't thought of before. But I do want to mention before I get to in depth and I always forget to mention this, but if you are an agent in the New York area New York City in particular, Eric's team is always looking for talented agents to, you know, add value and where they can add value to you. So I was thinking as you were talking, if I was looking for for a team, one of the things that agents, I think these these days just behind the scenes for a lot of people. If you're not sort of even haven't figured this out yet, working as an agent, a lot of times the managing brokers of firms are have a lot of responsibilities. They have to recruit talent. They have to retain talent. They have to do all the operations and the compliance and they have to also coach and train. So over the years, what managing brokers have kind of figured out is, if we have some really great teams, sometimes the teams can help take over some of those responsibilities specifically around training and coaching, right? It makes sense. And Eric is a professional coach and trainer and a certified negotiation master trainer. So if I were an agent and I was like, I'm not quite getting the love and training and support that I did at my existing firm, I would be reaching out. So definitely reach out to him again. Easiest way is just find them online. You can find them at Eric the agent again. That's E I R I K the agent will have a, I'm sorry, Eric the expert rather Eric the expert Instagram YouTube, etc. We'll have links to that if you are thinking, this is the year for where a lot of agents are moving. So I be remiss if I forgot to mention that. But here's what I really wanted to thank you. You're welcome. Here's what I really wanted to ask you while you were talking about collaborative. The sort of collaborative training, you know, I was thinking as you go into negotiations or when you go into a deal, I would think that the vast majority of agents who haven't been trained on value proposition are probably just thinking about their own wants and needs and thinking, how do we get what we want without thinking as you were saying sort of understanding the the holistic deal. So what does the other side want what are their motivations, what are they willing to sort of negotiate and bend on. And I think that is such an important skill that really isn't hardly taught anywhere. It's so true. It is so true. And one of the things that drew me to the real estate negotiation institute and this content is exactly what you just said, this is not something that we are taught in pre licensing. Some people bring it from their earlier career, if if if if a real estate is a is a second career for them, but it's not something that we're taught and and frankly to your point, a lot of managing directors and office managers and sales directors and I was a sales director for a long time. You're so involved with so many things within each and every deal that it's hard to sit down and have time to really get deep and train on negotiation and buyer psychology and this idea of understanding the other side's needs, not that you're going to guarantee them anything, not that you can guarantee them anything. But when we when we integrate the other sides needs into our strategy, this is what Tom Hamin calls, he calls it the enlightened self interest when when I know what the other side wants. And I do my best to incorporate their needs, their value elements into trades into exchanges in the deal. I can actually grow a bigger pie and that's the reason my one of my two blogs is called growing the pie. Because we're not talking about just a fixed pie of value when we're talking about a real estate transaction, everybody values things differently. And if I can identify what the other side wants and needs and identify ways to exchange things of lesser value to me to get things of greater value to me from the other side and do that strategically, I can actually make that pie bigger. And I can and I'm not you know, I want the other side to be adequately satisfied. I don't need them to, you know, it's not come by by the fire, right? This is not split the pie 50 50. I want them to be adequately satisfied. So I don't deal with the retribution or the entrenchment, the things that come along with putting someone on their heels or rubbing their nose in the dirt or whatever the the imagery is. I need to adequately satisfy them. And when I do that, I can actually create more value on my side of the transaction and get more than I would if I were just trying to split that fixed pie. Yeah, I agree. And that's a skill set. And it isn't necessarily something that we all just can instinctively inherently know ourselves. It's something there are. I study DBT dialectic behavior therapy and there's one of their modules is called interpersonal effectiveness, which is like, okay, what does that really mean? It's about having difficult conversations with people. And in real estate, we oftentimes have to have difficult conversations. And it's about how to meet both people's needs. But first you have to understand their needs. And I was thinking an example that I'm curious to get your thoughts on would would be I have a buyer. We're putting in a contract. Maybe there's a multiple offer situation. And I'm just thinking, well, highest invest is going to win, which maybe most of the time is true, but not always, of course. And knowing what the other sides motivations are, knowing what they want from a buyer. And maybe it's just highest invest or maybe it's we put a lot of work into this house. We sort of want the next family that comes in to sort of understand and appreciate and respect what we've done, because we want to we want to sort of create a little bit of a legacy here, even with our existing, you know, work that we did with the home. So I guess would that be considered part of understanding? Absolutely. And I'm, you know, this is this is such a part of who we are as human beings. And we forget it sometimes as real estate professionals because we put everything into down payment timeline and and highest price when that is not how every human being thinks. In fact, we it's not like, you know, let's say that that you are in a highest invest and it's a million dollar property. And you've got a few buyers who are above the asking price at 1.1. But let's say that you are at 1.08 or $20,000 off of the highest bidder. But you have made some sort of an appeal that is not price related or down payment related that is that is important to or that lands with that seller. It's not that they're giving up 1.1 million dollars. They're making a trade on $20,000. And the question is, what is that thing, that connection, the fact that somebody is going to come in and take care of that home, the way that they took care of that home? Right. What is that one thing or that as Chris Voss, if we're never split the difference, that he calls those blacks ones, right. What does that blacks want? If there's something that I can find out by being ceaselessly curious, by asking questions of the other side that gives me a window into what they really want and what they really value, then they they might be happy to give up $20,000 to satisfy that need, that value element that's important to them. So we often mistake this idea that the price is the only thing that matters. Or if I'm not 100% if I'm not all cash, I can't compete. It's just not true. If we can understand if we can start with the other side and uncover those blacks ones, understand those value elements. So that's a great example. Well, thank you. And I was, it's just the first thing that came to mind, but I was thinking, you know, you're, you're sort of further example of, you know, being $20,000 under highest invest and still possibly winning the deal. It's really an important thing because most times the other side isn't going to be able to go out and spend that $20,000 as cash. It's probably just going into the next property and you know odds are there may even be a mortgage on the file on the next property. So that's just all going into, you know, an extra $50 a month or something in payment. It's kind of a really a nothing. If it's only looked at as highest invest, then yeah, maybe that's maybe that that will make the difference. But understanding that, you know, yeah, we're coming in a little bit under, but I sort of have an idea of what the owner wants and, you know, and being able to meet their needs in a different way. And still get your clients a little bit less than, than maybe, you know, what, what everyone else would have paid. I love, I love all of this. Again, to me, these are all skills. And we are not taught about these in high school. I didn't learn them in college. I had to study persuasion and understanding rapport and understanding how to, you know, how, how to listen and how to, you know, sort of extract information, you know, in an elegant way from the people I'm chatting with. So I would, I would love to, but actually before before we go any further, I would, because you are a coach, you lead a team, you're also practicing yourself and you teach at a national level. This is a tough year for, for REALTORS. I did meet somebody last night at a party, one of the top agents here in Chicago, who said he's up 50%. And he's the only person I know. Everyone else is pretty much struggling, who's been in the business long enough. And we were laughing. And he's like, yeah, I know everyone hates me because, you know, they, they, everyone else is down. But, but it is a tough year. I think for a lot of us. And rates are up inventories down. And I know in New York, it's, it's really tough with inventory. So what, what are you doing to keep or what are you telling your students, as well as your teammates to sort of keep them motivated. And, and, you know, moving forward when it's so easy to just to kind of go like, oh, this is just hard right now. Yeah, I really do believe that we have to have these conversations with ourselves about how are we going to move from where we are right now to a market that we know is going to get better. Right. So first thing is to understand that this where we are right now is temporary. The question is, can you last through that time? Is that an easy thing for you or is that a hard thing for you? Are you at, on your last dollar and, and not earning a living for another three months, if you're not doing deals, is that going to crush you? If it is, then let's either put a plan together so that you can find a different way to maneuver through this industry. Are you, you know, are you, are you doing rental deals rather than sales deals? Are you working on the, the sell side versus the buy side, right? Are there things that we can do to help you on a different path than you're on right now, right? And then there are other agents who are like, yeah, I know I'm going to survive this. It's not an issue whether I'm going to survive this. It's a matter of how long this is going to be and what do I do in the meantime? And so what I tell the agents is, first of all, there is, and this is a almost cliche because so many people are saying it, but it's absolutely true. This idea that this is a skills based market, right? I've, you know, I've been listening to some of your other podcasts and we're, you know, you're talking about that, you know, people running through 2021 and part of 2022, you know, you could just throw a, you know, a sign in a yard. And you've got 30 people making offers, right? It was a market that did not require as much skill, certainly required skill, but didn't require as much skill as the market that we're in now right now. Not only are you competing to get that next listing and find that next buyer if you're on the listing side, but you're competing with a smaller amount of business and agents all fighting for that business. So how are you going to get a bigger piece to your point, this agent who's up 50%. How do you get a bigger piece of a shrinking pie? And that's where you need to really focus your energy in my opinion is, if you go through, you've already figured out, look, this, this isn't, this is a big piece of a, you know, this, this industry right now where we are, it's not going to kill me. It's not going to take me down. So I know that I can make it through it. Now the question is, what do you do with this time? And if you can focus on getting a bigger slice of that shrinking pie, that's, that's going to give you a goal to actually maneuver towards or move towards. So you start doing things like understanding in a more deep and and and higher level way, the idea of negotiation of buyer psychology of, of actually going into those pitches. And instead of getting one out of three or one out of two, you're getting every one. How are you going to increase your odds of getting each deal? How are you going to build loyalty with each and every buyer so that they end up being a deal rather than losing buyers here and there as you might be accustomed to doing. So how do you maximize the business that you do have and make sure that you win each and every time, right, this goes, and this goes back to the highest and best too. They're going to still be highest and best. But if you're more prepared or if you're, if you can prepare your buyers better, you're going to find yourself on the winning side of that highest and best more often than on the losing side. And my one of my old bosses used to call this spilling milk, right. When we're busy, when we have a lot going on and we're just trying to keep every keep everything, you know, in our hands as we run forward, we are spilling milk left and right, but we don't really care about the milk that spills because by the end of the time we're stop running, we still have enough milk to drink, right. We're just constantly going, going, going. Well, in a market that we're in right now, we don't want to spill milk. We want to make sure that we have as much milk, there may be less milk in the glass to begin with. So we don't want to lose more milk and we can end that same journey with the same amount of milk. We just haven't spilled a lot of it. And that's what that's what I usually teach people in this market is look, let's figure out how you're going to make it to the next level because there will be another great market on the other side of this. But we do need to enhance our skills and create an environment where we win more often. I agree. And I think this is the time to really focus on skill based activities because number one, most agents have a little bit more time to spend sharpening their skill set, their tools. And also this is a time where human nature for the most, for the majority of us and I'm in the same category. So I'm not saying that this is a negative. It's just human nature is to want to when things aren't as well, maybe retreat a little bit. And I end, you know, do less activity because maybe we're a little bummed out or or so. So this is the, these are the times where you might have to force yourself to do a little bit more activity, but understanding that you're really doing your future self a huge favor by doing things today. And most agents are not most agents. I don't know what percentage of agents have have reduced their activity. But you know, I just know that when, when things are tough, you know, it's easier to not go into action. And so this is the time to get an accountability partner, get a coach, you know, and really work on those skills and those habits so that, you know, what you're doing today, a year, a year and a half from now will start to yield fruit or however long, you know, the sale cycle is. And to add to that, you know, I think that oftentimes when we when we do find ourselves here where we're retreating, like you said, we're doing a little bit less, a little bit less work than we know that we should be doing at the time. Sometimes the reaction to that from a lot of coaches in our industry or a lot of managers is to tell you the things that you need to do. And oftentimes they highlight the things that you are least likely to want to do, right. So they basically say, these are things you're not doing. And this is why you're not not successful. So you got to get out there and do all those things that you don't like to do because that's the way that you're going to break this cycle. Where I, you know, certainly we have to do things that we don't want to do, especially if we're sitting on a couch and we find ourselves not working as hard as we should be working. But my approach is a little different. I want to identify the things that you love to do. And you may have found that your real estate career for two years, you're running around like a chicken with your head cut off. So you're just trying to just get to the next place and do the next deal. And you forget about what you love about this business, what you love about people, what you love about your knowledge, what you know, all the things that make this an attractive business. So my approach is to sit down and say, let's start with the things that you love and do a lot more of that. So I'd rather you do 100% more of something that you love than struggle to do 25% more of something you don't like. And it doesn't have to be. Yeah, I want to pause you for a second because that is such a wise, a wise wise statement doing more about what you, especially when you're in a more difficult position like we know a lot of agents are this year. Yes, we know it's a little bit of a bummer right now. And it's easy to retreat. So what we call it in DBT stacking positives do the things that you already like to do. And here's why and I'm not I'm not trying to tell teach Eric anything. Obviously here. I love this. Well, the only reason I mentioned is I was just I just learned the so gallup, the people who do lots of polling, their big polling company is a lot of people know they have this strength and weakness finder. And we had a professor from from Northwestern come in who's trained and she assessed our strengths and weaknesses. And I think there was 38 of them. And she goes, whatever you were your bottom five are don't even try to improve those because she's like the data is really, really clear that you can't you can't it's not how you're wired. It's really you maybe can make them incrementally better. But just like for example her most her biggest weakness was empathy. And she goes, it's kind of funny. I wish I was empathic. I'm just not tell I'm built. So I don't try to pretend that I'm empathic. I try to focus on all the other positives things that I do have a strength. She goes, so if you come to me for empathy, you're probably not going to get what you need. But she goes, my partner happens is very high in empathy. And so she sort of balances her her wife balances it out. But the point is is know what your strengths are know what you like to do because you're right. It's much easier to get into action with the things that you want to do and you like doing. And then you can build from there. Exactly. You know, it's funny. The strength finder the gallop strengths. Their system my brother and I are building online content for my coaching company. And he's a certified gallop strengths. Oh, that's funny. Oh, what a small world. Yeah. The great. It's a great assessment. And they're right on. I mean this idea of of not doing the things that you don't excel at. But understanding, and this is great for interpersonal relationships too as well. Right. I mean when you when you are a manager or a coach or a team leader or just an agent having interactions with clients. When you can look across and identify when you know what your strengths are. And you can start to identify potential strengths or strengths that the other side has. Then you start making connections or if they have different sets of strengths, you then can understand why. You know, if you've got somebody who's low on empathy or empathy is one of their lowest strengths. You can start to understand then why or how you need to communicate with them in order to have a more successful relationship rather than always budding heads because your strengths are completely different. Yeah, it makes sense. And also like you were saying assessing the other person, especially like during presentations. You talked about buyer and seller presentations. And I think so many of us think about first, okay, we got to learn a script. We got to know what we're going to do when we get there. And we're probably realistically. We're probably doing the same kind of pitch every single time because we we we've committed to memory. We've done it hundreds of times. Maybe if we've been in the business long enough and it has a certain success level and we're like, hey, I do close one out of every three listing presentations. I do. But if you're doing the same exact listing presentation each time, there's probably a missed opportunity there to get some feedback from the person on the other side of the table. And then adjust your your strategy to better meet that person's needs, which probably means not doing the same presentation in exactly the way every single time. 100% and this I actually have a course that I teach through our archway partners called the decision makers. And it's all about so going back to the first thing we talked about, which is starting with the other side identifying the other sides needs. What it what it who are they right so when we do a value proposition, we have to separate that make a huge distinction between what value proposition is and what a pitch is right. We do a listings pitch we call it listings pitch. It's really a value proposition. The pitch is something you give an elevator. It's generic. It could be to anybody right. It's that thing that sells your product or service the best. Whereas a value proposition is something a little bit or vastly different in that value proposition must be in order for it to be at its most effective. It must be tailored to the decision maker to whom you are pitching. So are they an assertive driver are they a collaborative feeler are they an expressive humanist are they an analytic thinker what type of buyer is this or decision maker is this. And how are they best influenced right are they data driven do they love stories and this is a huge aha I think for any negotiator is that when you go in and you you've tailored that pitch you know exactly what you're going to say when you're going to say it. It's basically a script you're forgetting the most important part who the client is right who are they and when you if you can hone that skill of identifying different buyer types are different as I call them decision maker types. You are going to find these all of these new doors open up and now you have this menu of benefits and just like looking at a menu in a in a restaurant you can start to pick the five the six benefits that convey the most utility to that specific decision maker. And you will find that your hit rate your success rate is off the charts because now you're the person across the table feels like you're speaking directly to them and that you've got a window into their heart their mind their soul whatever you know you're just so much more impactful and persuasive when you know who you're who it is that you're dealing with it and it's more intimate and what I mean intimate I mean connecting because you have taken feedback from the other person you are that. And then processing that yourself and making adjustments to fit that person's world view their beliefs etc their their their values and and I am I think you know if we think about this because I hear REALTORS talk about this all the time which is I don't like selling to a certain type of individual I don't like selling to an analytic person because all they want is the numbers it's not emotional other people love it my point is is what if you could learn how to speak their language. You you you maybe you'd enjoy working with those agent or those clients more but more importantly maybe you just be more effective at it which means you close more deals whether you like it or not you're still going to come across people who aren't the same sort of way the process information make decisions like you were saying the decision making sort of understanding the decision makers and the strategies and then it wouldn't be cool to go into a listing presentation by a presentation having like five or six different styles of pitches and then knowing oh this is this kind of. I think I'm going to push the conversation more towards this because I know that this tends to sort of you know tickle the ivories of that particular you know thought process of that individual that is an incredible power as opposed to just going it's another one of these analytics people I don't know how to do this. 100% you're absolutely right and in coaching we call that flexing right so I can flex my approach to meet that person where they are it's not they're not being a jerk. You know whatever label we put on them there are jerk they're irrational they're they're crazy you know we put all of these labels on people because we don't know how to connect. So what you're saying is absolutely right if we can flex our approach and go okay this is an assertive driver they don't want to have a personal relationship with me they're not going to ask me about my family and my kids and where I went to college if they do ask me where I went to college it's going to be to that whether they believe the coach. The college that I went to is suitable for their needs right and if I can if if I understand that about them they're not mean they come off as your typical negotiator very competitive negotiator but they are intr everybody acts in their own interests and their interest is to hire the person that they believe is going to do the best possible job for them they don't want a shrinking violet they don't want somebody who's going to wind around telling stories or or or use pufferier BS them on on on the answer to a question they don't know they want you to be direct they'd rather you say you know what that's a great question I don't know the answer or that's a great question I know that you're going to want specifics you're going to want details I understand that so before I answer the question let me get you the specifics and the details that I know that you want so that I can give you an answer that's going to be that's going to satisfy your needs. Imagine if our agent said that to us we're a buyer or seller and we're an analytic and our agent said that to us it would be like music to our ears and now all of a sudden that trust component is going through the roof when you didn't think you could build trust for that person at all you didn't think they would trust anybody and now all the sudden you've connected with them on their level and so now they start to that trust factor starts to go up and up and up and you change the relationship. Yeah you just gave such a really specifically excellent example in my opinion because this idea of like you're just using analytic people is you know saying to them on hey I understand you process information this particular way I know you like a lot of information that's important for you to make a decision therefore I need to go back and put together this information in a way that's exactly how you want to see it so you can then take it digest it and people who are analytic under such a way that's going to be a good question. I understand that putting that data together takes time so it actually gives you on the other side of the deal a lot less pressure to come up with the answer right then in there which probably isn't going to be sufficient to satisfy their curiosity because unless you're just an encyclopedia of information and you're able to present it in the way that they want but probably they want to look at something they probably want to hold hold or at least look on a screen and see that you put some work in so they can be like this person speaks my language it's actually brilliant because it's a win win for us. Everybody it's it gets lets you off the hook a little bit to feel like oh god I don't know the answer right now you're going to you know and you're going to say it to them in a way which most of the time they're going to go hey that makes sense just get it to me in the next you know day or two and that would be you know I'll digest it. 100% and DJ you said like the the thing you said about there they'll want the time to go through the data the research that you prepare and and this is where those these these moments where we understand that there's a different way of doing things. So if you're going to get these things you know what they're going to do is come from right so we if we are the kind of person where we're like well I want to get every I feel like I need to get everything to them immediately right now so if I say I'm going to take some time I'm afraid they're going to be upset with me well if you really understand an analytic thinker then you'll know that they're very slow to make decisions once they make a decision they commit to it and they're full bore but they want to take that extra time in fact what I say to to people who take my decision makers class we're talking about how to influence a analytic thinker you say you if you're if you're going to meet with them at noon don't met don't plan a 2 p.m. meeting you're going to meet with them at three ask them if they want to go out to dinner after your three hour meeting don't plan something an hour after you have a meeting with an analytic thinker because you're going to end up in the last 15 minutes of that meeting whether it's an hour later or two hours later going oh my god how am I going to get to my next appointment you're going to start to rush them site you know subconsciously because you're rushed and then you ruin ruin all the relationship building and all the trust that you've been building for two hours goes out the window because you got to get out the door to another appointment so if you're going to meet with an analytic thinker set the entire morning aside or set the entire afternoon aside they may not need it but you're not going to ever feel like you are rushing them to a decision and and to your point that with the data they will accept the fact that you need time to put together the data and the research and the way that they want to view it and the way they want to consume it and if they believe that we're on a tighter timeline they will let you know absolutely and these are these are things that again we know our own world view we know our own processes for making this or some of us know and others of us maybe aren't aren't included to our own ways in which we we make decisions but this is really a skill set and a knowledge set that you need to consider adding because it's only going to make every interaction you have with a client or the other side of a transaction go hopefully more smoothly because you're going to be able to identify there's key identifiers in the way people speak in the in the way they reveal themselves to you which sometimes is conscious versus unconscious there's there's lots of cues that somebody who is trained on how to identify these cues verbal cues non-verbal cues that that we can actually start to paint a picture maybe without the person even necessarily being fully aware that we're putting them in a category we're doing it because that's that's how human beings classify things but it's how we make it's how we can make adjustments and say oh this person's starting to fall into this category I'm getting a better sense of what they may want to see or hear so all of this is it's all skills and these are things that I can almost assure you you probably haven't been taught unless you have sorted out on your own and so this is a great point to to remind everyone who's listening if you're an agent in the New York area and you're looking for a team with this kind of information that they can impart to you or if you're an agent from anywhere in the country that's looking to get some coaching Eric would love the opportunity to speak with you is coaching companies archway partners Inc and of course his his team over at Browns Harris Stevens is always looking for agents in the area to possibly join up on the team as well so please check those two places out um Eric I wanted to ask you to about what what do you what where there now actors are taught how to do this I in your backgrounds and acting so I know there's you know there's different styles of or different philosophies of acting there's sort of the strawspurg I only know a couple I'm not an actor but there's a strawspurg method there's there's method acting I think that's a russburg but there's uh Uda Hagen there's there's a few of them that you guys you're some good polls right here uh you know I'm yeah well my knowledge is is uh is very shallow so I know that's it that's all I know I don't know how to do any of it but but this is important because I was listening to some actors talking about how they really uh pay a lot of attention to the other actors in the scene to then get cues on how to then react what to do with their hands what to just how to sort of be in the scene but really sort of memorizing their own lines if they have them to then forget them so that they can be present for whatever's going on in the scene and understanding that there's an interpersonal play between the actors who are you know not just reciting lines and walking here and there when they're supposed to yeah absolutely don't now keep in mind I'm a real estate agent so you know you may not want to trust my acting advice because it didn't work out so well for me but no you're absolutely right they you know we always say acting is reacting right and this is the same thing this is one of the skills I think why you see a lot of actors who who end up in the real estate world because one of the attributes one of the skills they bring to this career is being able to read people or being able to react um to people in a moment and and that's there is a skill to that so certainly I think that um you know one of my one of my junior agents on my team runs a women's improv company this woman so so she she's spent a many many years she was an actress and a singer and now she runs an improv company well her this idea of she loves role playing so when we are when we're talking and we're working through a situation she's working with a with a client and um she's looking for some advice I will present some options for her some ideas you know it's for her and say what do you think what would you do and so we'll work through that and then what you'll always want to do after we've settled on what we think the next move is she'll say okay let me workshop this with you and then she'll go and she'll tell me how she's gonna say it when she gets on the phone or in person with the client or the co-broker or whoever it is so she's constantly role playing so that it sets it sits and it and it and it um sinks in for her so there and a lot of people I would say that you know I'm a big fan of role playing in my in my negotiation courses we end the certified negotiation expert the core concepts course with a with a big role play we role play a deal right I got buyers agents and listing agents they get there all the the um the backstory of their client they know that we uh subject property specifics and all the comps and we have them negotiate a deal and it's it's that how we culminate all of this it's the culmination of all of the learning in this course so I'm a big fan of role playing but if you if you are someone who knows an actor in real fear comfort zone and this is when we talk about the at-bats right you're gonna hit more singles hit more home runs hit more doubles you're gonna hit more if you have been practicing before you step up to the plate right that is just that's just something we all know if our prepared to have that conversation to deal with the objections all of that stuff if we're prepared when we get into a real life scenario because we've been role playing our rate of success or our likelihood of success goes up significantly so I I would highly recommend to anybody any of your listeners if you're not role playing if you don't have an accountability partner or a manager that will help you role play through scenarios um well first of all take my class uh and then you'll be in the whole um reny advantage facebook community and you can role play with other certified negotiation experts but it's a big big help to be able to to flex that muscle and to practice yeah and role playing to me is you know really the only way I know to practice it because it's it's funny we we were just practicing we were getting media trained at our local association here because I serve on some committees and occasionally we are asked to do media uh interviews and things so and and I was like oh I do podcasts I know I know how to do this and so they gave us some tips and some things and and I went okay I kind of know all that and then we role played and I sat with a fake reporter who was uh uh uh pretty I was on on screen for like a tv spot and I said I don't need to practice this I got it I know how to talk I can I can be us my way through this and about 30 seconds in I was like oh my god I did not prepare it any at all for this I am out of things to say I thought I could wing it and I've done 500 of these episodes doesn't mean I'm a good inherently a good interviewer or good interviewee but I certainly was like oh that's right you got to practice so practicing is everything so even if you're as Eric is 17 years in the business role playing is still great because it'll it'll force you to do the things that you're not very good at um and and cause you to as as you said move outside of your ex uh your your um your comfort zone I also want to mention one other just practical as I'm a marketer so I wanted to mention why I think the certified negotiation expert is from a marketing perspective and from a skills-based perspective it's it's an absolute win but even if you're just looking at it as from a marketing perspective as far as all the designations go and there's lots of wonderful ones I'm not saying one is any better than another but I and I shouldn't say but and um I do think the certified negotiation expert designation is a very marketable one because it allows you to actually say hey I've got this thing and only maybe 1% of all the REALTORS in the country have it or whatever the percentages it's not much higher than 1% I suspect so it allows you to really differentiate yourself to arguably one of the most important uh skills in the game of being a real estate agent which is of course negotiation so being able to communicate that to a client um and say hey it's something that they can understand without knowing anything about our our industry and so there's just a really nice it's very on the nose it's exactly what it is I am a negotiation expert and um then you can actually talk about it in a way where I think it will help sort of differentiate yourself from from other other agents here that's right and and and you're you it sounds like you were in you've been in my class because that's exactly how we describe it right and in some cases the biggest value that some agents get out of my class and I and I think there's so many there's so much value in it there's so many things that you can that you can take from this class whether you've been an agent in the business for three decades or three months it's a class that that is accessible for new agents but it's also high level for those who have been negotiating for for several years but sometimes what um my agents get out of the class is a new way to your exact point PJ a new way to um to convey this information to their client to have the conversation to to um explain how they strategize and how they work through negotiations so that your client knows when they're no longer in the room when they're no longer standing next to you that you are going to be advocating for them that you are going to be um cooperative as you mentioned earlier cooperative but assertive that you have a plan in place and that you're going to be able to execute on that plan so just being able to convey your strategy to a client in a in a in a sound um a cogent effective way is very very important but um but but this I mean this the this the CNE designation the logo is also just a door opener right so when they see it it's in your marketing materials it's in your auto signature now you can have a conversation it brings up the idea of negotiation and now you can highlight the importance and what studies show is negotiation skills are more important to our clients than marketing than market analysis it is the highest skill that we can provide our our our clients now uh in practice it's one of the we score slower than most anything in negotiation skills in the eyes of our client and that's where there's this opportunity if you can learn this skill if you can master this skill you will separate yourself from you know to your point 98% of the agents in the in this country I think too this other I was thinking as you were saying this that why why is the negotiation part so critical and I I think obviously it's because it's about money usually but um and it's about the transaction and winning winning the deal or earning the deal however I was also thinking um maybe the certified negotiation expert uh sort of skill set comes really into play when a transaction gets tough because I I would assume that the vast majority of the most stressful moments the most emotionally trying parts of a transaction have got to be during the negotiation because there there could be a time where the deal might fall apart or feels like it might fall apart the client might be freaking out going oh my god I maybe I'm making the wrong decision maybe I'm giving up too much me so that that's probably a highly stressful time emotionally it's the least fun time I would think for the client usually unless maybe you're on the list side I guess maybe you know if you're selling a property maybe it's a little bit more fun but on the buy side certainly it's tough and so I was just thinking I bet those skills come into play to help calm everything down as you're going through the stressful times you're right you're right and and we we talk about the this comes out of the book getting to yes is William Yuri and Roger Fisher who wrote one of the seminal works in collaborative negotiation the book called getting to yes and they talk about this what's called the Sam model and you know this the S is the stand it's where we positionally bargain it's where we you know it's no I won't yes yes you will no I won't it's the stand that we all take to not be moved off of our position we don't want to be thrown one direction or another so we anchor in we put we take a stand I will not sell my apartment for less than seven hundred thousand dollars come hell or high water that's a stand right I need to understand what the area actual area of concern is and what is emotionally driving this this stand right so that's the S a and M the stand the area of concern and the emotional motivators the M so you're right it's about understanding people it's about when at that when they're at their most anxious they're most frustrated it's not getting caught in positional bargaining but understanding what their actual area of concern is by asking questions and then it's about communication and offering options people do not like to be backed into a corner they don't like to feel like they're backed into a corner they want options and at the hardest moment of the deal when you're communicating well with your client and you are looking at all the value elements that could be a possible way to get successfully get the transaction done when you've identified what we call as Harvard calls your baton or your best alternative to a negotiated agreement if you have a strong baton if you have a which is plan B right if you have a strong plan B and you're communicating and you're providing options now your client feels empowered and instead of feeling like they're backed into a corner or like they have no options now you make them feel like hey if this doesn't work out it's going to be because we didn't meet our minimum goals so if plan A is not going to work for us let's move on to plan B as opposed to getting into highest invest after highest invest and feeling like you're just like a rag doll getting thrown around we have the power to help our clients remain resilient and empowered and we do that by communicating with them in the hardest of times in the deal just like you said and having like you said having options and also you said something very very profound that I want to make sure our audience noticed if not I'm going to step on it a little bit in a good way. There's a skill at DBT we call it cope ahead I almost forgot it and basically if this doesn't go the way we want here is what we will do and getting their buy-in client buy-in hey does this make sense you know I'm sure you're getting buy-ins all the time but saying here's what we're going to try here's what we're going to do here's why we think it will work if it doesn't here's another alternative that we are going here's our plan B and and even just having a plan B is very empowering because all of a sudden now when option A doesn't work out no big deal we've got option B and and it's it's most agents I think I don't know I shouldn't speak for any other agents but I think a lot of agents probably don't have a plan B you know when they're putting offers in they have it or if they have one maybe they haven't effectively communicated it to the client because they go I don't really want my client to think that planning might not work so I just gonna I'm gonna mention if it doesn't if it does it I'll deal with it when it happens that's probably not a strong strategy because there are going to be times when you obviously when you don't get what you want and and making sure that the client already knows we have another option here that that is profound and I'm really really glad that you said that these are all skills again this is this is a skills-based conversation and we're focusing a lot on it because guys skills win the game the fundamentals win the game so these are all things you can learn that's the best part you don't have to be good at it you just have to be willing to to practice and Eric you know he can teach you in a number of different ways if you're an agent in New York City consider joining his team at Brown Harris Stevens I mean he'll teach it to

you're talking about however I appreciate that those are skills that any one of us can learn and we should consider learning those and these are the soft skills that really can can win the game push the ball over that one yard line and they're they might even feel a little bit like magic once you learn them because you're going to be unlocking things that are invisible to other people and when you learn to unlock what's the invisible which becomes visible to you it just be I think everything just becomes more fun and your your hit rate is going to go up your success rate is going to improve
