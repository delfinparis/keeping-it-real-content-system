[00:02:31] Okay, guys, you've heard enough from me.
[00:02:33] Let's get to the main event.
[00:02:34] My conversation with Marisol Jasino.
[00:02:48] Okay, to ditch Marisol Jasino from Cold Well Banker, she services Central Florida.
[00:02:55] Let me tell you more about Marisol.
[00:02:57] Now, Marisol is Latina.
[00:02:58] She is a single mom.
[00:03:00] She is a domestic violence survivor and a REALTOR for the last 19 years, actually 20 years.
[00:03:07] By 2010, she realized as much as she loved serving people, Marisol did not have proper sales
[00:03:12] training.
[00:03:13] So she went on to time shares for its training and in January 2013, returned to real estate.
[00:03:20] Once back in real estate while facing life, continuous life's continuous challenges, which
[00:03:25] at times made it extremely difficult to work.
[00:03:28] Marisol realized that business kept on moving without doing much at the time.
[00:03:32] Her phone was ringing and transactions were closing.
[00:03:35] And that's when she realized she had learned to tap into a forgotten community within the
[00:03:40] industry, the Latino community.
[00:03:42] The largest growing minority in the United States.
[00:03:46] Marisol has been able to grow her agency and her confidence in ways she never thought
[00:03:50] possible.
[00:03:51] She is a top REALTOR in Florida.
[00:03:54] Learn more about Marisol by visiting her website, which is G12.
[00:03:58] So the letter G12, professionalgroup.com, G12, professionalgroup.com.
[00:04:03] By the way, we'll have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:04:05] You don't have to type it in.
[00:04:06] And please, please, please follow her on Instagram.
[00:04:09] That's M. Justino, J-U-S-T-I-N-O.
[00:04:13] Sorry.

[00:04:25] Marisol, we are excited to have you.
[00:04:27] Welcome to the show.
[00:04:28] Thank you.
[00:04:29] I am excited to be here.
[00:04:31] I am so excited to talk with you and talk about how you have grown your business and what
[00:04:37] our audience can gather from you.
[00:04:40] And it is a holiday weekend while we're recording this.
[00:04:43] So we are going to try to make this as light and breezy as possible so that if anyone is
[00:04:48] watching us as we record it live, they can enjoy right into the holiday weekend.
[00:04:53] Marisol, love to learn more about how you got into real estate.
[00:04:58] Tell me the process there.
[00:05:01] How and why?
[00:05:02] Well, the why was that I needed to do something.
[00:05:09] I was in a domestic violence situation and I knew I needed to get out of there.
[00:05:15] I didn't know how.
[00:05:18] And as crazy as it sounds, years before I used to live in Ohio.
[00:05:22] I had a friend and she said, you know, she took me to a meeting with her friend and her
[00:05:29] friend was a broker and her friend said, well, let's just recruit her.
[00:05:33] And my friend says, well, no, she has little kids.
[00:05:36] You have no idea what you do to her.
[00:05:38] But that's steady, my mind.
[00:05:40] Then just before I move to Florida, you know, and I'm talking to a good friend.
[00:05:46] And at this point, I know that life is hard and I have no idea what the future held.
[00:05:52] And I say, but I don't even know what to do over there because back in Ohio, I used to
[00:05:57] work for NASA over there.
[00:05:59] And I, but I didn't want that nine to five and that's street, you know, schedule plus
[00:06:05] I was going to be living a bit of a distance from NASA.
[00:06:09] So she said, why don't you just become a REALTOR and some like, that's two voices.
[00:06:13] So I kept it in the back of my mind.
[00:06:17] So then when life began changing, I'm like, you know, what, let's do this.
[00:06:22] So I call a friend, which was the neighborhood, my neighborhood expert, she was a REALTOR.
[00:06:29] She lived to house two houses down from me.
[00:06:31] She said, you need to go for it.
[00:06:33] I've always known you're supposed to be a REALTOR.
[00:06:36] I'm like, how everybody knows, but I don't know, you know.
[00:06:40] So she counseled me.
[00:06:42] I went and I took the license, you know, the classes, the weekend before I took my estate exam.
[00:06:50] I did a 10, a 10 mile race and I broke my left, my left.
[00:06:56] Oh, no.
[00:06:58] So I am like, I'm thinking this is it.
[00:07:02] And I said, okay, God, when I am in that test, if I don't pass, I'm done.
[00:07:05] But I guess I was supposed to be here.
[00:07:08] I did pass it.
[00:07:09] So that's kind of my story.
[00:07:12] Well, I always love the expression and this is I'm not promoting or denying anyone's religious beliefs,
[00:07:18] but I always love the expression, whatever anyone's spiritual beliefs are,
[00:07:22] that God never gives you more than you can handle in a given moment.
[00:07:26] Although it does get tested.
[00:07:29] And breaking your leg a day before a somewhat challenging exam is not not the easiest or most
[00:07:36] for the weekend before and the weekend before.
[00:07:38] The weekend before.
[00:07:39] Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:07:40] Well, it is it is interesting too that there are people that seem to show up in our lives.
[00:07:46] Again, whatever your anyone's belief is about the universe or higher power or whatever.
[00:07:52] There are things that happen where sometimes people just know things about you that you don't know
[00:07:57] and if you just listen, you know, sometimes it's like, oh, and a couple people are telling me
[00:08:03] to do this. Maybe I should do it and obviously it worked out really, really well for you.
[00:08:07] So tell us what it was like getting into really an industry that you didn't have experience in before.
[00:08:14] Was that challenging? How did you grow your business?
[00:08:17] It was. I mean, because first you don't know much, obviously, because we learned,
[00:08:22] and everybody tells you when you take the real estate class, you know, you're just thought how to
[00:08:27] pass an exam, not to how to sell real estate. I did have a lot of support. You know, there's always
[00:08:34] good agents that try to help you and so forth. As crazy as it sounds, my very first listing, it was my
[00:08:43] son and he was just seven, seven years old, seven, eight years old. And he goes to his, again,
[00:08:53] you know, everybody believes what they believe, but he goes to his Sunday school teacher and he says,
[00:08:59] by the way, do you happen to know anybody that you got to be, hold on, I'm stopping this story
[00:09:04] because there's no way this story is true. When you first said, I want to just back up and
[00:09:10] case anyone missed that. So Marisol said something that at first I thought I clearly heard this wrong
[00:09:15] and I'm not going to interrupt her. And then when she got out, I go, no, I heard it right and I'm
[00:09:19] only pausing you because this is the cutest story I've ever heard. So she said her first listing was
[00:09:24] from her son who was seven years old and he goes into school and go ahead. I'm so sorry.
[00:09:29] Yeah, he asked him, you know, do you happen to know anyone that needs to buy your cell phone?
[00:09:36] And he looks at him and says, as a matter of fact, I do, I am thinking about selling. I said, well,
[00:09:43] you need to use my mom because she just got her license and that was my first listing.
[00:09:49] That is, that is the most adorable. It's the, it's, I've done 500 episodes. That's the without
[00:09:55] exception, the cutest and most adorable story that could ever be for someone's first listing.
[00:10:00] Cheers, cheers to your son. That is, that is really, oh boy, that is, that's about, that's about
[00:10:06] having a good family team right there. So, oh my gosh, how cute is that? Well, what, what an adorable
[00:10:12] story and what a, what a great son. Yeah, that's so cute. So okay, so aside from, from that, did
[00:10:20] everything sort of snow like continue to grow from that one? It just began. It just, it was just
[00:10:25] happening. I mean, doing what the basic things that we do, yes, you know, because stuff does happen.
[00:10:32] But nevertheless, at the same time on my personal life, I was going through a divorce and all the
[00:10:39] craziness. So life was crazy. Life was crazy, but somehow things always worked out. I mean, don't
[00:10:46] ask me how things always did work out. But by 2010, that's when I was, because a lot of agents left
[00:10:57] the market in 2008, the market crash. And the funny thing is that they say, they usually say,
[00:11:05] if you last five years, you're going to stay on the market. And I'm like, well, you know what,
[00:11:10] even if I sell one list in a year, I'm staying, you know, it's like, I need to beat that mark.
[00:11:17] But honestly, by 2010, I was worn out and I had no idea what to do, overwhelm in every sense. And
[00:11:25] that's when I left and when you do not share, because I needed training. I needed training.
[00:11:31] There is, there are so many people that left in that time because for those of us that weren't
[00:11:38] in real estate during that time, this of course is when the crash happened. This was a lot of the
[00:11:43] loans that were done with, you know, they were very generous with loans. Florida in particular
[00:11:49] was very hard because they had much easier restrictions there. And so, and like every third or
[00:11:58] fourth person in Florida had a real estate license at that time, it was some crazy statistics. So
[00:12:03] everybody had a license. People were making money hand over fist and they were just selling and
[00:12:07] reselling properties. And, and then of course, the collapse happened and it was devastating for
[00:12:13] many, many people. So I love the fact that you at that point said, you know, I really could use
[00:12:18] more training. And, you know, the time share world, despite when anyone might think about that
[00:12:23] type of business, the salesmanship that is taught in those in those, those rooms for those
[00:12:30] companies is beyond impressive because it works. Yes, it does. They're training. I, and when
[00:12:37] young people come to me and ask me, you know, what should I do? I'm thinking I would join in real
[00:12:42] estate. And my advice is always please do it. Get the license. Go sell time shares for a few months.
[00:12:49] Yeah, it's going. You'll be awesome. Well, and those are, those are particularly tough because
[00:12:56] and I know like my parents used to do this when when they were younger when they maybe didn't have
[00:13:02] as much money, but they would have an, you know, somehow they would be on lists where they would get
[00:13:07] flown to like Las Vegas. And they would go for, you know, get free, free room and maybe a free hotel,
[00:13:14] or sorry, free airline, I'm not sure. And you'd have to sit through a presentation. But, you know,
[00:13:20] you know, most of the people in that room are doing the same sort of thing. They don't really want
[00:13:24] to buy a time share. So it's a very difficult sale because, you know, if the person's ready to buy,
[00:13:29] it's great. But the vast majority of people just want the freebie. And so it does make it a
[00:13:33] challenge. And there's a lot of objections to overcome. And you're asking for a lot of someone's
[00:13:38] money. And it's, it's, it's a very, very difficult sale. So I think you're right. There's the sales
[00:13:43] training there has got to be just amazing. It should be. Yeah. Okay. So you were in time shares. You,
[00:13:49] you got the sales training and then you decided eventually to return it to the traditional brokerage
[00:13:55] world. Yeah. Yeah. Well, after I left time shares and I am like, because I had said to myself,
[00:14:01] I don't know if I can do this. And I'm thinking, what do I do with my life? And I received a call from
[00:14:10] a former client. And he says, Lisa, I don't know why you're nervous. I'm making this call, but I
[00:14:16] need to talk to you. And I'm like, well, you tell me. And he says, call me crazy, but you need to go
[00:14:22] back to real estate. This is you were born for that. You need to go back. And I just smiled because
[00:14:30] at that point, I was actually coming from meeting with a broker just because I had also a friend that
[00:14:37] called from the Miami area. And she said, listen, I don't know if you're selling real estate.
[00:14:44] But I want to buy a condo, you know, in the Orlando area, we have 400,000 cash. Can you help us?
[00:14:51] And I was like, yes. Yes, yes. So that that was my way back in. That was my way back in.
[00:15:00] And then at that point, it's just, you know, it was relearning because yes, I had learned the
[00:15:07] selling part. But now it's like, earn relationship part of the business.
[00:15:16] How and close the technicalities because there's so much technology that everything changes.
[00:15:22] Everything changes. So it was time to do that. But I was going to life. I still, because unfortunately,
[00:15:29] my case, you know, I, I was in an abusive relationship as I mentioned, I divorced in 2005.
[00:15:36] But it wasn't until literally early last month that final, everything finally ended because there
[00:15:42] was an injunction. So it's been really a drain. So it's just at sometimes you wonder. And that's,
[00:15:51] but that's when I noticed, it's like, hold it. I mean, I'm still making it. Things are happening.
[00:15:58] Even in the worst days, there's always the ball is still rolling. And that's when I'm like,
[00:16:05] but what is it? And I began looking at my book of business. And it's referrals of referrals of
[00:16:11] referrals, you know, I mean, two years ago, I closed my first buyer. I closed them all over again.
[00:16:20] You know, so it's like that referral book. When you stay in touch with them, and when you do what
[00:16:26] you're supposed to do, yeah, they stay loyal. They do. And first, I also want to honor you for sharing
[00:16:34] about your challenges you've faced. And the victimization that's happened that happens to you. And
[00:16:41] the fact that you were dealing with that, but not only while it was happening, but for about 17 years
[00:16:47] or 18 years after 18 years, I mean, that is a heavy, heavy bag to carry around. And it is not an
[00:16:56] easy thing. So I honor you for carrying that bag for as long as you did. I know that's that can't
[00:17:03] possibly be easy. And also a good reminder, I think to anyone out there that that knows of maybe
[00:17:10] somebody that's that's in a similar situation that is currently in a similar situation. And maybe
[00:17:14] the people are afraid, the person's afraid to leave because maybe they don't think about how they
[00:17:19] don't understand how they could support themselves. If they were to leave a relationship and maybe
[00:17:24] they think, well, it's better to be in even an abusive one than not abusive one because at least
[00:17:28] I at least I can pay the bills in this abusive one, which of course, you know, is is not not a great
[00:17:34] place to be. And to, you know, sometimes it's just a couple of people to say, hey, I think you can
[00:17:40] do this. And so it's it's a great, great reminder to encourage people who are trapped or who feel
[00:17:46] trapped in those in those sadly abusive relationships to maybe see a pathway out. And so I honor you for
[00:17:53] sharing that week. I mean, we have thousands and thousands of listeners. I guarantee that that
[00:17:58] story is going to touch somebody and maybe even inspire somebody who might be in that situation or
[00:18:03] know someone in that situation to maybe see a different path. And so I honor you for the courage
[00:18:08] to talk about that. Thank you. And I also want to talk about the Hispanic market because I know
[00:18:16] that here in Chicago, which is where I'm located, we have a large Hispanic population. And there is
[00:18:22] a tendency because we have about 800 agents here at our own company. So I just talked to a lot of
[00:18:28] agents. And I'm always recruiting agents for our firms. I'm always talking to agents. And whenever
[00:18:33] somebody brings up the Hispanic sort of demographic for for finding buyers and sellers, a lot of times
[00:18:40] what what agents will say is, oh, well, I don't know that I don't know that market. I don't know what
[00:18:45] those what what what that group of people is looking for. I don't know how to communicate with them.
[00:18:50] I don't really know how to infiltrate or penetrate that market to really get in.
[00:18:55] And so I would love any just information or advice you might have because you're right. It is the
[00:19:01] largest minority non or yeah, minority group growing at the fastest rate in our country. So it's
[00:19:07] important to certainly not ignore that group, but learn maybe how to better communicate with that
[00:19:12] group and understand what what what their needs and desires are. So I'd be love to hear more about
[00:19:17] that. Well, in summary, because there's so much that you can do, but the the question the big question
[00:19:25] is, and most people say, well, what do I do? Just like you express it's like this. And everything
[00:19:32] that is so known, we we kind of tend to stay away from it. But it's not that hard because to begin
[00:19:39] with, you know, about 70% of the Hispanic population speaks English. You know, so that's one
[00:19:47] thing. You know, yes, will it help to speak Spanish? Well, of course, you know, of course,
[00:19:53] it will. But if you don't speak Spanish, chances are your buyer seller will speak English.
[00:20:03] Is there's a big chance? Most of the buyers right now, the Hispanic buyers are 30 and below,
[00:20:11] 30 years old and below me, which means they have been born and raised in this country. So they are
[00:20:17] you know, they know the language. It's that's the first thing. But that's about English. That's
[00:20:23] how talking about English is Spanish. But knowing that Hispanic or the Latino language, it really
[00:20:29] is more than is an English or Spanish. It's how the week communicate. What's going on in there?
[00:20:36] You know, it will help, of course, to know a little bit of maybe the basics, because you gain trust
[00:20:42] when you speak about the basics. You know, when you say a few words in Spanish, like most people
[00:20:48] will say, you know, well, I took Spanish when I was in high school. That's really, really sweet.
[00:20:54] But I have forgotten all about it. But what about if we add, but I hope that you can teach me how to,
[00:21:00] you know, that kind of you can help me remember those little nuggets, you know, that will help.
[00:21:07] That will really help. And it's also the respect, you know, because when you are honest, because
[00:21:18] honesty will be the best policy you have to be honest. If you are not, if they, if they, if we
[00:21:25] don't perceive that you're being honest, you'll be treated nicely, but that there's going to be a
[00:21:32] wall. And if it happens, that you do a transaction with that person, that's the end of it. That's
[00:21:39] the beginning and the end. Sometimes as crazy as it sounds, it might be even better not to the transaction,
[00:21:49] but keep in the relationship. Yeah, maybe even referring it for referring it to an agent who
[00:21:55] who really is immersed into that, that community. Because it's the transparency and explain the
[00:22:04] processes from A to Z. What I usually tell my buyers and my sellers, what you see is what you get.
[00:22:12] You, I'm going to tell you the good, the bad, the pretty and the ugly, you're going to know it all.
[00:22:18] And there's a lot of time spent on that orientation, whether it's the buyers orientation or the
[00:22:26] listing presentation, a listing presentation with a Hispanic is not going to last you 20 minutes. I'm
[00:22:31] sorry to tell you that. You know, it's usually not going to, because they want to get to know you. And
[00:22:39] they're, we are not going to tell us our stuff until we know that you can be trusted.
[00:22:45] Ah, that's, that's really interesting. So I was, while you were talking about that, I was thinking,
[00:22:50] I know here in Chicago, there are a tremendous number of Hispanic cultural events. There are
[00:22:57] culture, there are places where they were Hispanic people gather. There's, you know, certain events
[00:23:03] and, and, you know, experiences that they tend to have. And if I wanted to immerse myself in that
[00:23:10] culture to get more business, I would be going to a lot of those events. I'd be, I'd be in the
[00:23:15] background for a while learning about that culture, learning about how they communicate, what's
[00:23:20] important to them. And then eventually, you know, sort of working my way into opening, having them
[00:23:27] see me as a trusted advisor, but you're right. It just, it isn't going to happen overnight.
[00:23:33] It's not, that doesn't go step to begin with to get, so that's personal knowledge. So you'll get
[00:23:39] that personal knowledge. You can go to events in which you're going to meet people one on one,
[00:23:46] although I really believe, I mean, with so many Hispanics in the US right now, everybody knows
[00:23:51] at least one. I mean, everybody does. It's like, build that relationship because from that relationship,
[00:23:59] you're going to be selling to everybody. And when I mean everybody is literally, if they love you
[00:24:05] and trust you, you call them or you say, listen, I need help on these. They will. But again,
[00:24:12] you have to reimburse that. I mean, when they call you and they will call you for little things,
[00:24:18] you know, sometimes, you know, their computer broke as crazy as it sounds. You know, can you help me?
[00:24:24] Well, I have learned a lot of how computers by helping them, you know, because it is Hispanics
[00:24:29] that you family and culture. Absolutely. And family and culture are, yes, I would have, if you
[00:24:37] were to say, what would my guess be about what I know about Hispanic community, I would say family
[00:24:43] and culture as well. So that is that that brings true with my experience. I am, I am, I have a
[00:24:49] Hispanic name. I am not really Hispanic myself. My first name is Delphan and my middle name is
[00:24:57] Joaquin. So I have a Spanish from Spain, a Spain Spanish name. But anyway, but but the point is,
[00:25:04] is I was not, I didn't was not raised in that culture. And so as a result, I will, but I do know,
[00:25:11] we have, gosh, probably a few hundred of our agents are Hispanic here at KL. So, but yeah,
[00:25:17] you're right. It's it's it's about earning trust because I think what what sometimes people forget
[00:25:22] about people who come to this country or or who are in a minority group that are that are here
[00:25:27] is that they're oftentimes, and I mean, we should just be honest about it. These are, you know,
[00:25:32] Hispanic people are often treated less than non-Hispanics and and and all other minorities get treated
[00:25:39] this way too. And we have to remember, especially if we're not a minority, to remember that not
[00:25:44] everyone's treated the same. And so some some groups are going to naturally be a little bit more
[00:25:50] defensive or or that's going to take more time to earn their trust because of the way they're treated
[00:25:55] on a regular basis. And so, you know, this idea that, you know, I would it would be a great if
[00:26:01] everyone was treated the same sadly, it's not exactly the way it is yet. So, you know, earning
[00:26:06] that trust is is is not an automatic. No, it's it's not. But the reality is and that's just
[00:26:13] a little nugget. The reality is that most, which is truly interesting, I was I was looking at
[00:26:19] numbers most Hispanics right now, I mean, they are they have been American born. So that means yes,
[00:26:28] there is panics and when you get one, you get the family, but the culture is changing in the
[00:26:34] sense that there's more communication. You know, we're beginning to see beyond, you know, your
[00:26:42] D so you're that because most of them the growth of the Hispanic population since 2010 is due to
[00:26:49] Hispanics being born in America, not other not not immigration, not immigration. Yeah, that makes
[00:26:57] sense. And that opens up the that that a lot of times like you were saying sort of resolves the
[00:27:04] language barrier that could exist because the ones the second generation or the people that were
[00:27:09] born here obviously are speaking English. Maybe maybe not it's it might not be their first language,
[00:27:14] but they certainly grew up in our our school systems and learned English as well. Yeah, that makes
[00:27:19] sense. But I'm sorry. No, what I was going to say, but you it does help to communicate because once
[00:27:29] you get to them, you're going to be going home and mom and dad chances are these big Spanish. Yeah.
[00:27:35] Yeah, and you know, it's it's never been an eat. Well, I don't it's never easy to learn anyone
[00:27:40] else's language, but it's never been easier because we have these devices in our pocket that we carry
[00:27:46] around 24 seven like there's do a lingo. There's a number of of the of the learn a language apps. And
[00:27:53] you know, maybe you won't speak perfectly within a year of studying, but you'll know enough to be
[00:27:59] able to at least show the community that you're putting effort into learning their culture, their
[00:28:05] language, their traditions. And of course, Hispanic people have been traditions. It's important
[00:28:11] to honor these traditions to to be part of them to learn about them so that you can participate.
[00:28:17] Yes, anybody can be learned. I mean, it really and I say that because I moved into this country,
[00:28:25] I'm originally from Puerto Rico. And I moved in 89 and when I moved from Puerto Rico and I
[00:28:33] ended up in the Cleveland, Ohio area, I didn't know the language. Sure. I couldn't speak the language.
[00:28:42] And I understand the frustration when you're learning a second language, but I tell people if I
[00:28:54] don't know Cleveland all that well, but there couldn't have been a large Puerto Rican community in
[00:28:59] Cleveland, right? That had to be very, very small. Now, nowhere I was and I didn't, obviously I
[00:29:05] didn't know anybody, but the fun, this is just a funny story. The funny story is that I'm like, okay,
[00:29:12] I mean, I need to learn the language. So I turn on the TV because most people tell you turn on
[00:29:16] the TV and that's how you learn. Well, guess what? When I turned that TV on, what came up was
[00:29:22] the Beverly Hills Billies. And now I'm laughing about it, but I cried. I cried because it was like,
[00:29:30] I'll never be able to, I'll never be able to. Yeah, it's it is an interesting thing. If anyone ever
[00:29:37] has not had that experience of watching a foreign film or watching a television show that was
[00:29:42] a shot in, you know, in a different language, it is incredibly difficult to try to understand
[00:29:49] what's going on if you don't know the language at all, but you can learn it over time, of course,
[00:29:53] but it is that's a hard way to do it, for sure. So, so I would love to know about the ways in which
[00:30:02] you stay in touch with your sphere of influence in between transactions, right? So while you're
[00:30:10] working with a client, I assume you're speaking with them all the time, you're constantly servicing
[00:30:15] them. Obviously, you're doing a great job. But what happens? So they buy yourself a home that
[00:30:19] closes and then like, you know, maybe they don't need you for the next seven years or so until they're
[00:30:26] ready to make another transaction. What do you do to keep that relationship strong during those
[00:30:30] those times? Well, if he's the first, the first time I've done a transaction with that person,
[00:30:36] you know, I let him know throughout the process. Listen, this is coming to a close, but I'm not going
[00:30:42] anywhere. You need me, you call me. It doesn't matter what. I said, don't call me at two in the morning.
[00:30:50] But if you do, it's okay, but my phone will be on silence. But just to set that standard,
[00:30:58] that this is what you can expect. And then every now and then is more, more that the phone call
[00:31:05] at anything else. Because yes, you know, we're taught to put everything in the CRM and send this and
[00:31:11] send that. And you know what? Most people will not look at it. It will end up in the spam folder
[00:31:19] or they will unsubscribe. It's especially with the Hispanic client. And fun enough, I am the same
[00:31:27] way. So this is how I realized how it was going on. Because in my case, it's kind of the opposite
[00:31:32] when I was getting into the American culture. So it was, that's when I realized, but hold it,
[00:31:40] this is how I felt. This is what I was going through. And there's a quote that says, show me how
[00:31:48] much you care. And then we can talk. And it's literally the same thing. It literally is the same
[00:31:56] thing. It's be there. Yes, you'll be invited to the birthdays. You'll be invited, you know,
[00:32:02] to everything, you know, something is going on sometimes to be decisions, sometimes big decisions
[00:32:08] are being made. And you're called, you know, listen, what do you think about this? You know,
[00:32:16] when an innocent owner is, it can be scary. It can be scary. But I always thought people,
[00:32:22] I will never tell anyone what to do. But what does your heart tell you? But you will be asked,
[00:32:29] because they will see you as that contact, that person. And your phone will ring. There were times,
[00:32:37] in my worst times, in which it's like, okay, what's going to happen in here? Because I didn't have
[00:32:42] the mind to do anything and overwhelm and so forth. And the phone rings. And they, you talk and
[00:32:50] check it. I haven't heard from you in a while. So it's really funny because it works the opposite way.
[00:32:56] If it's been a while and you haven't made contact, you will be called because they want to know,
[00:33:02] why haven't you called? So it's really sweet. It's really sweet. I love that. And I want to make sure that
[00:33:11] the, you made a very important point that I believe you made a very important point. I just want to
[00:33:16] underline it, which was sending out email newsletters, which is very common. And I'm not here to tell
[00:33:23] you not to do that because I think there's a reason to do that. And I think there's a good reason to do
[00:33:29] that. But is that necessarily going to demonstrate to a client that you care about them? No. It's just
[00:33:36] going to demonstrate that they're on your email list and you're still in the business. And that's
[00:33:41] if that's the intention, if the intention is like, oh, this is all I need to do to stay in contact with
[00:33:48] somebody to send them a newsletter. No, that's probably not going to demonstrate to anybody that
[00:33:52] you care about them. It's just going to demonstrate that you're still in business. So like you were
[00:33:56] saying, I love that you said, hey, the transaction's completed, but I'm not going anywhere. And in fact,
[00:34:01] when you need anything, anything related to your home or anything at all, you reach out to me. And
[00:34:07] if I can't do it, I'll get you to the right person that can. That's how you demonstrate care.
[00:34:13] And that's what people, that's what everybody really wants. We don't really want another email
[00:34:16] newsletter. But it's not, it's okay to do it. Just don't make that the only thing you do and don't
[00:34:21] think that that demonstrates care. It doesn't. It just demonstrates that you're a decent marketer,
[00:34:26] but it doesn't necessarily mean that you're helping anyone. And the best that is basically set them
[00:34:34] up and forget them. That's the way I see it. And that's the way. And that's the way everybody
[00:34:39] feels when they get those emails. You don't feel special for getting a email. Even if it's a happy
[00:34:44] birthday, even if especially if it's a happy birthday email that is automated, it's like pick up
[00:34:51] the phone, call the person. They're probably not going to answer anyway. You'll get their voicemail
[00:34:55] and leave them a happy birthday message or sing them happy birthday or do something that actually
[00:35:00] demonstrates that you care. And that goes a million miles further than even, look, a text is
[00:35:07] better than an email, but a phone call. We still all love to hear somebody who, now we don't always
[00:35:12] maybe like to talk on the phone, but we love it when people reach out and say, hey, I'm thinking
[00:35:16] about your happy birthday. Yep, that's correct. Yeah, it's so much about demonstrating care, isn't it,
[00:35:22] to the client? And that's the bottom line, which is it works in reality, it works with any
[00:35:29] transaction. It really works with any client, but the, the other reality is that the, with the
[00:35:36] Hispanic client is going to, if you're resilient, if you really, if you really want that client,
[00:35:44] you're going to have to work for it. It's not going to come easy. But once, once you have established
[00:35:50] that relationship, it's yours. But then, but never take it for granted either. I wanted to ask you
[00:35:58] about the Hispanic community, specifically about first time home buyers, because I see a huge
[00:36:05] opportunity to educate certain renters in the Hispanic community who maybe had never even
[00:36:14] pursued home ownership. Maybe they didn't know how, how to do it or what was, what the process was.
[00:36:21] Maybe they were embarrassed to ask. I know that I was embarrassed to ask when I, before I bought
[00:36:27] my first place, I didn't want to ask anyone like what's a mortgage, how does it work? I was too
[00:36:32] embarrassed, because I was in the financial services world, not in real estate. But I was like, I
[00:36:36] should know this and I don't, and I feel silly asking. And, and now you can just Google everything,
[00:36:42] obviously, and learn about it. But not everybody does that. And sometimes people just, they're,
[00:36:46] their blinders are on, no one's taught, educated them. So I'm curious on the, you know, hey,
[00:36:52] moving from renting to home ownership, doing those kind of seminars, you know, bringing in,
[00:36:57] you know, inviting people in those communities that are really underserved, and teaching people
[00:37:03] about the pathway to home ownership, was that something that that you've been involved with,
[00:37:08] or do you have any suggestions about how someone may consider doing that?
[00:37:12] I have been in the past, and there's one thing to make clear. Right now, also, last year,
[00:37:18] 7.9 million Latinos were home ownership ready financially. So the reality, but again,
[00:37:28] and they will come to those things, because like, like in here, like we have, there's so many
[00:37:35] first-time buyers assistance programs available, because there are so many of them. And when they go
[00:37:41] through that program, you know, from 8 to 8, they'll get explained the process. But again,
[00:37:49] they won't really, when you approach them the first time, is I get rid of the idea that I'm
[00:37:57] going to get telling it's, and I'm going to close, in 6 months, I'm going to close these 10 people.
[00:38:02] No, no, because the same process, you start in the, you just got a heads up, a head start,
[00:38:09] but you're going to start that process of developing that relationship. And you can explain
[00:38:15] the process from 8 to 8, but if you did not build that trust, they're going to go find someone
[00:38:20] that they will trust. Yeah, that just makes perfect, perfect sense. And you know, this idea of
[00:38:30] earning trust is the way that I think is, of course, by being of service. And the, I've always
[00:38:40] thought felt that the Hispanic community, because they put so much emphasis on family. And there's
[00:38:44] so, and again, they are historically have not been treated well by people who, you know, especially
[00:38:51] first-generation have a, you know, language barrier, obviously cultural barrier, and just being seen
[00:38:58] as maybe even a threat to our country. Some people see Hispanic people as a threat, which is,
[00:39:03] which is unfortunate, but it is a reality that Hispanic people still sometimes have to deal with.
[00:39:09] And so this is really important to understand that history for anyone that really wants to serve
[00:39:14] that community, because to understand their history means you can empathize or sympathize and
[00:39:19] really get a better sense of the challenges that community faces, so that you can be of, of better
[00:39:25] service that you can feel for the struggles that they've had. And, and the reality, and another thing
[00:39:33] to, to view is, you know, what I have learned, and I'm sure everybody that's watching right now
[00:39:39] has learned as well, is, you know, the issue is never the issue.
[00:39:46] Very simple. The issue is never the issue. So something is happening. If, if I get upset,
[00:39:53] you know, it's not the client, it's me. So I better go and find out what got triggered in me,
[00:40:00] so don't personalize, just professionalize and keep it up.
[00:40:04] You know, you, you were reminding me, I'm going a little bit off, off of, off script for a moment,
[00:40:10] not that we're on a script, but just off, off the conversation, you just reminded me of a very smart
[00:40:14] thing that I've heard is spoken about in the 12-step rooms, which is, so if anyone's familiar with
[00:40:22] with 12-step programs, one of the, one of the lessons that is learned in that room was people get
[00:40:27] sober or they stop doing these problematic behaviors and find a supportive community to help them
[00:40:33] through whatever addictions they might have is they learn that when something is activated within me,
[00:40:40] it's not the event that's active. It's something like you just said, that's within me, that's being
[00:40:44] triggered, being adjusted, and it doesn't mean that whatever's happening externally doesn't matter,
[00:40:49] no, it does matter, but it's important to know that I am reacting a certain way and I can learn
[00:40:56] emotional regulation, I can learn how to, how to control my response so that I can be more supportive
[00:41:04] while this chaos is happening to my client as opposed, because the client's going to be in chaos.
[00:41:09] The client is good, especially when something goes wrong, you know this, of course, our listeners know
[00:41:13] this, something always goes wrong with every transaction, there's always a bump in the road,
[00:41:17] and during that bump, the client is probably freaking out because that's what happens, it's a large
[00:41:22] financial purchaser sale, and you can be the adult in the room and say, look, I know this feels a
[00:41:29] certain way, I know what this is, I know how to handle this, I am here to, to make sure you feel okay
[00:41:35] and, and being that guide through the emotional ups and downs. That is correct, lost at the same time,
[00:41:42] if every time you meet with that client, especially the turbine, if every time, if you're building that
[00:41:48] relationship, if you are talking, I like to tell them, like I always, like I mentioned at the beginning,
[00:41:54] the good, the bad and the ugly, you know, and third party stories, just tell them stories, listen,
[00:42:00] this, this may happen because I tell them, please throw walk on me, I don't want you to go to bed with
[00:42:07] questions, because by the time you wake up, it's going to be an nightmare. Yes, please, please, please,
[00:42:15] I want to know, you have any questions, tell me, I want to know what's going on in your mind,
[00:42:21] and if I don't know the answer, which by now I just laugh and I say, I doubt that I want, but if I
[00:42:26] don't, I will find out, I will find out, if something go wrong and I tell them, if there's something
[00:42:34] that you think may go wrong, if there's something that you're not telling me, so listen, this is
[00:42:39] a divorce course, it's going to come out, it's going to come out, so just tell me so we can deal with
[00:42:47] it, we can find the solution, because everything has a solution, so let's just talk about it and
[00:42:54] get to the bottom of it. And I think, you know, it reminded me of, when I bought my condo, not my first
[00:43:03] purchase, by the way, a couple of years ago, and I, by the way, I've been, I'm not practicing
[00:43:07] REALTOR, but I am in with REALTORS every day all day. It's all, this is my job, and I talk to
[00:43:13] REALTORS, I teach REALTORS even how to close business, and yet the day of the night before I was
[00:43:21] closing on my condo, all of a sudden, I had one of those freakouts where I was actually ice skating
[00:43:27] with my girlfriend, and I couldn't even hardly get on the ice, I go, I think I've ruined my life,
[00:43:31] I think this is a terrible decision, I don't know what I'm doing, by the way, I'm in the industry,
[00:43:35] I have a license, and I'm sitting there, and I'm like, I can't get out of this, I think I just
[00:43:40] ruined my entire life. Anyway, everything turned out fine, but the point is, is I suffered silently,
[00:43:45] I really, I mean, I told my girlfriend, but she didn't really know what to do, other than say,
[00:43:49] it's going to be okay, but what I really needed at that moment was another professional,
[00:43:54] I needed to share that with another professional, and they needed to say, everybody feels like that,
[00:43:59] don't worry, it's totally normal, you're going to be okay, I'm taking care of this, and so it's a good
[00:44:05] reminder that even people who you think, oh, they seem fine, you need to check in with them, and
[00:44:10] allow them, like you said, please throw up on me, because if you're just throwing up, like I was
[00:44:17] freaking out, and I would like, wait a minute, if I'm freaking out, it must be a real thing,
[00:44:22] because I'm in the industry, well, no, it wasn't, it was all in my head, but I didn't have anyone
[00:44:26] there to throw up on, and so as a result, I suffered, and it turned out okay, of course, but you're
[00:44:32] so absolutely right, and we forget this is REALTOR sometimes, because we always think it's going to
[00:44:37] work out, we'll figure this out, the person might not always feel the same way. Well, no, plus we need
[00:44:42] to find out, where are they coming from? Yeah. And if we know them well enough, we know whether this
[00:44:50] is the first transaction, we know whether they went for closure in the past. Right. You know,
[00:44:55] they love their home, or you know, they got denied, or they got taken by an agent, which
[00:45:03] unfortunately, it's happened. Yeah. So the more we know, when they say this, or even before they say
[00:45:12] it, because if we know, we know, we can walk a step ahead and say, listen, this is the way you
[00:45:18] might be feeling now. And I usually turn specially to the buyers after they sign the contract,
[00:45:25] it's like, listen, after we sign this, this is the process, but this is the process that we have
[00:45:32] in writing, these are the steps that are going to happen, doesn't matter what, but now let's talk
[00:45:38] about the process that you are going to go through emotionally, because this is what's going on.
[00:45:44] That is a brilliant way of saying it, and also really, really calming, because what you're doing is,
[00:45:52] of course, is you're basically validating someone's feelings. And instead of just like, oh, it's
[00:45:58] going to work out. Don't worry. I got it. It's like, I understand how you're feeling. A lot of people
[00:46:02] feel this way. You know, I'm here to guide you through. I'm, you know, I've got you. And being
[00:46:10] able to empathize with them and say, that must be a hard feeling. I get it. I hear you, I'm here to
[00:46:15] help you through it is really what, and most people aren't willing to share that without you asking,
[00:46:23] because it's embarrassing. It can be embarrassing to somebody. It can be just painful to talk about.
[00:46:28] I mean, no one wants to talk about fear, but it's there. And so what I loved about what you said is,
[00:46:33] you asked, how are you feeling about this? And if they were like, oh, my God, I'm totally freaking
[00:46:38] out. I don't think you'd be like, well, you shouldn't freak out. You should be like, no,
[00:46:41] no, I get it. Don't worry. I'm here with you. I'm not, I'm going to be the rock that you can hold
[00:46:47] on to as you freak out. And we're going to get you through. That's it. Just walk a step ahead of them.
[00:46:55] And just that, that, and no, wait, you need to know what's going on. And tell them this is,
[00:47:01] this is okay. It is okay. Or if they put a little bit of distance because people do,
[00:47:07] that tells you there's something. There is something is going on that they're scared to share.
[00:47:15] And at that point, just see just evaluate the relationship, the agent client relationship from
[00:47:23] eight to see, evaluate all those conversations because people always tell us how they feel.
[00:47:30] Yeah. They always do. So, and if you know enough, you know, and you will not be able to take off
[00:47:37] ends, even if they scream at you or whatever, because you know what's going on. And it's not you.
[00:47:45] It's just, oh, I was yelling at my girlfriend the night before she had nothing to do with the
[00:47:49] transaction. She just was in the room. So I'm like, I'm yelling. I mean, I'm not really,
[00:47:54] I'm not blaming her, but I'm yelling. Oh, I got I freaked out. And she was just like, it's going
[00:47:59] to be okay. And I was like, you don't know, you're not in the business. I'm in the business. I'm freaking
[00:48:03] out. Right. So, so it happens. And you're right, being there to really be there during those
[00:48:08] emotional moments and making sure the person feels comfortable to share those emotional moments.
[00:48:15] Boy, boy, you are, you know, they're going to tell everybody about you if if you help them during
[00:48:20] those during those tough emotional moments and that they feel comfortable enough to share.
[00:48:24] They're going to tell everybody, oh my gosh, my REALTOR is the greatest. Yeah.
[00:48:28] Plus, remind them early on that the reality is when you're going to do something new,
[00:48:35] everybody's an expert around them because I tell them, now you're going to go, you're going to
[00:48:39] tell someone that you're going to buy a house, everybody's going to be an expert. And I said,
[00:48:43] and people are well intentioned people are coming to my heart. But the reality and I tell them,
[00:48:50] like, for example, and I use the pimple story, for example, if you get a pimple, you know,
[00:48:56] everybody's telling you how to get rid of it. Everybody is. Well, the one you have to go to is a
[00:49:01] dermatologist. Right. Go to the expert, you know, because you can end up burning your face.
[00:49:07] So it's okay. But if someone tells you something that puts you on his and makes you scared,
[00:49:15] tell me, tell me and I can explain what's going on. Yeah, or just correct the information.
[00:49:21] Sometimes it's just like you said, sometimes just bad information, you know, putting toothpaste
[00:49:25] on the pimple, maybe that maybe that really hurts the skin, even though it sounds like a cool little
[00:49:31] hack to fix it. Maybe that actually would make things worse. I had a similar experience at the
[00:49:36] dermatologist few many years ago where I was reading online, people were saying, oh, you should wash
[00:49:40] your hair less. It's actually bad for the scalp to wash your hair every day. And I was like, okay,
[00:49:45] I read enough articles that said it. I just assumed it was true. I went in to go see my dermatologist
[00:49:49] who had been practicing for like 40 years. And I go, it's okay if I don't wash my hair every day,
[00:49:54] right? And he goes, no, you should wash your hair every day. And I go, no, no, I'm reading this
[00:49:58] stuff. He goes, that's wrong. Don't, no, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, maybe it's different for women
[00:50:02] and for men. I'm not here to tell you what to do. Anybody what to do. But he was like, no, well,
[00:50:07] I have, I have a skin condition. So for my particular skin condition, so maybe I don't know what
[00:50:11] the average person should, but he said, with your skin condition, you need to wash every single day.
[00:50:16] He goes, it's actually going to make it worse if you only wash your hair like two or three times
[00:50:21] a week. It's actually bad for you. And I was like, oh, he goes, yeah, don't read, if you're going
[00:50:25] to read stuff online, run it by me. I'll tell you the truth. And I was like, oh, yeah, of course.
[00:50:29] So you're absolutely right. You know, making somebody, because who knows what people read online,
[00:50:34] they can be persuaded. They can read things that, that, you know, aren't in their best interest.
[00:50:39] And they don't know it. And so that's why you as a professional are so important. So Marisol, I
[00:50:44] think this is a great, perfect place to wrap up. I do want to mention for everyone listening
[00:50:49] that Marisol works in Florida and guess where a lot of people retire to. Florida, we all know that.
[00:50:54] So at least everyone from Illinois goes down there. I know my parents are down there as well.
[00:51:00] So if anyone out there has clients moving to Florida, whether they're, you know, maybe a second
[00:51:05] home, maybe retirement, you know, maybe they're moving to the villages or one of those kind of places
[00:51:10] wherever, you know, especially if they're in central Florida, reach out to Marisol. She would love
[00:51:15] the opportunity to connect with other REALTORS. And by the way, she has clients that move other
[00:51:19] places too. So maybe you can work out a nice little referral network. And by the way too,
[00:51:24] you know, and I don't know Marisol if you're looking to expand your group, your team. But of course,
[00:51:29] if you are, people can reach out to you if they think they'd be a good fit on your team. But if you
[00:51:33] have clients, if anyone has clients that are moving to central Florida, have them reach out to Marisol
[00:51:39] because obviously she is one of the top agents in that area. So and I want everybody to follow Marisol.
[00:51:45] First go to her website, which is g12professionalgroup.com linked to that in the show notes. And follow
[00:51:53] her on Instagram. M. Justino one at on Instagram. So M. Justino one linked to that as well in the show

My conversation with Marisol Jasino. Okay, to ditch Marisol Jasino from Cold Well Banker, she services Central Florida. Let me tell you more about Marisol. Now, Marisol is Latina. She is a single mom. She is a domestic violence survivor and a REALTOR for the last 19 years, actually 20 years. By 2010, she realized as much as she loved serving people, Marisol did not have proper sales training. So she went on to time shares for its training and in January 2013, returned to real estate. Once back in real estate while facing life, continuous life's continuous challenges, which at times made it extremely difficult to work. Marisol realized that business kept on moving without doing much at the time. Her phone was ringing and transactions were closing. And that's when she realized she had learned to tap into a forgotten community within the industry, the Latino community. The largest growing minority in the United States. Marisol has been able to grow her agency and her confidence in ways she never thought possible. She is a top REALTOR in Florida. Learn more about Marisol by visiting her website, which is G12. So the letter G12, professionalgroup.com, G12, professionalgroup.com. By the way, we'll have a link to that in the show notes. You don't have to type it in. And please, please, please follow her on Instagram. That's M. Justino, J-U-S-T-I-N-O. Sorry. J-U-S-I-N-O. M. J-U-S-I-N-O, the number one at Instagram. Again, link to that as well in the show notes. So when I make a mistake, you don't have to worry because you just click on it in the show notes. Marisol, we are excited to have you. Welcome to the show. Thank you. I am excited to be here. I am so excited to talk with you and talk about how you have grown your business and what our audience can gather from you. And it is a holiday weekend while we're recording this. So we are going to try to make this as light and breezy as possible so that if anyone is watching us as we record it live, they can enjoy right into the holiday weekend. Marisol, love to learn more about how you got into real estate. Tell me the process there. How and why? Well, the why was that I needed to do something. I was in a domestic violence situation and I knew I needed to get out of there. I didn't know how. And as crazy as it sounds, years before I used to live in Ohio. I had a friend and she said, you know, she took me to a meeting with her friend and her friend was a broker and her friend said, well, let's just recruit her. And my friend says, well, no, she has little kids. You have no idea what you do to her. But that's steady, my mind. Then just before I move to Florida, you know, and I'm talking to a good friend. And at this point, I know that life is hard and I have no idea what the future held. And I say, but I don't even know what to do over there because back in Ohio, I used to work for NASA over there. And I, but I didn't want that nine to five and that's street, you know, schedule plus I was going to be living a bit of a distance from NASA. So she said, why don't you just become a REALTOR and some like, that's two voices. So I kept it in the back of my mind. So then when life began changing, I'm like, you know, what, let's do this. So I call a friend, which was the neighborhood, my neighborhood expert, she was a REALTOR. She lived to house two houses down from me. She said, you need to go for it. I've always known you're supposed to be a REALTOR. I'm like, how everybody knows, but I don't know, you know. So she counseled me. I went and I took the license, you know, the classes, the weekend before I took my estate exam. I did a 10, a 10 mile race and I broke my left, my left. Oh, no. So I am like, I'm thinking this is it. And I said, okay, God, when I am in that test, if I don't pass, I'm done. But I guess I was supposed to be here. I did pass it. So that's kind of my story. Well, I always love the expression and this is I'm not promoting or denying anyone's religious beliefs, but I always love the expression, whatever anyone's spiritual beliefs are, that God never gives you more than you can handle in a given moment. Although it does get tested. And breaking your leg a day before a somewhat challenging exam is not not the easiest or most for the weekend before and the weekend before. The weekend before. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Well, it is it is interesting too that there are people that seem to show up in our lives. Again, whatever your anyone's belief is about the universe or higher power or whatever. There are things that happen where sometimes people just know things about you that you don't know and if you just listen, you know, sometimes it's like, oh, and a couple people are telling me to do this. Maybe I should do it and obviously it worked out really, really well for you. So tell us what it was like getting into really an industry that you didn't have experience in before. Was that challenging? How did you grow your business? It was. I mean, because first you don't know much, obviously, because we learned, and everybody tells you when you take the real estate class, you know, you're just thought how to pass an exam, not to how to sell real estate. I did have a lot of support. You know, there's always good agents that try to help you and so forth. As crazy as it sounds, my very first listing, it was my son and he was just seven, seven years old, seven, eight years old. And he goes to his, again, you know, everybody believes what they believe, but he goes to his Sunday school teacher and he says, by the way, do you happen to know anybody that you got to be, hold on, I'm stopping this story because there's no way this story is true. When you first said, I want to just back up and case anyone missed that. So Marisol said something that at first I thought I clearly heard this wrong and I'm not going to interrupt her. And then when she got out, I go, no, I heard it right and I'm only pausing you because this is the cutest story I've ever heard. So she said her first listing was from her son who was seven years old and he goes into school and go ahead. I'm so sorry. Yeah, he asked him, you know, do you happen to know anyone that needs to buy your cell phone? And he looks at him and says, as a matter of fact, I do, I am thinking about selling. I said, well, you need to use my mom because she just got her license and that was my first listing. That is, that is the most adorable. It's the, it's, I've done 500 episodes. That's the without exception, the cutest and most adorable story that could ever be for someone's first listing. Cheers, cheers to your son. That is, that is really, oh boy, that is, that's about, that's about having a good family team right there. So, oh my gosh, how cute is that? Well, what, what an adorable story and what a, what a great son. Yeah, that's so cute. So okay, so aside from, from that, did everything sort of snow like continue to grow from that one? It just began. It just, it was just happening. I mean, doing what the basic things that we do, yes, you know, because stuff does happen. But nevertheless, at the same time on my personal life, I was going through a divorce and all the craziness. So life was crazy. Life was crazy, but somehow things always worked out. I mean, don't ask me how things always did work out. But by 2010, that's when I was, because a lot of agents left the market in 2008, the market crash. And the funny thing is that they say, they usually say, if you last five years, you're going to stay on the market. And I'm like, well, you know what, even if I sell one list in a year, I'm staying, you know, it's like, I need to beat that mark. But honestly, by 2010, I was worn out and I had no idea what to do, overwhelm in every sense. And that's when I left and when you do not share, because I needed training. I needed training. There is, there are so many people that left in that time because for those of us that weren't in real estate during that time, this of course is when the crash happened. This was a lot of the loans that were done with, you know, they were very generous with loans. Florida in particular was very hard because they had much easier restrictions there. And so, and like every third or fourth person in Florida had a real estate license at that time, it was some crazy statistics. So everybody had a license. People were making money hand over fist and they were just selling and reselling properties. And, and then of course, the collapse happened and it was devastating for many, many people. So I love the fact that you at that point said, you know, I really could use more training. And, you know, the time share world, despite when anyone might think about that type of business, the salesmanship that is taught in those in those, those rooms for those companies is beyond impressive because it works. Yes, it does. They're training. I, and when young people come to me and ask me, you know, what should I do? I'm thinking I would join in real estate. And my advice is always please do it. Get the license. Go sell time shares for a few months. Yeah, it's going. You'll be awesome. Well, and those are, those are particularly tough because and I know like my parents used to do this when when they were younger when they maybe didn't have as much money, but they would have an, you know, somehow they would be on lists where they would get flown to like Las Vegas. And they would go for, you know, get free, free room and maybe a free hotel, or sorry, free airline, I'm not sure. And you'd have to sit through a presentation. But, you know, you know, most of the people in that room are doing the same sort of thing. They don't really want to buy a time share. So it's a very difficult sale because, you know, if the person's ready to buy, it's great. But the vast majority of people just want the freebie. And so it does make it a challenge. And there's a lot of objections to overcome. And you're asking for a lot of someone's money. And it's, it's, it's a very, very difficult sale. So I think you're right. There's the sales training there has got to be just amazing. It should be. Yeah. Okay. So you were in time shares. You, you got the sales training and then you decided eventually to return it to the traditional brokerage world. Yeah. Yeah. Well, after I left time shares and I am like, because I had said to myself, I don't know if I can do this. And I'm thinking, what do I do with my life? And I received a call from a former client. And he says, Lisa, I don't know why you're nervous. I'm making this call, but I need to talk to you. And I'm like, well, you tell me. And he says, call me crazy, but you need to go back to real estate. This is you were born for that. You need to go back. And I just smiled because at that point, I was actually coming from meeting with a broker just because I had also a friend that called from the Miami area. And she said, listen, I don't know if you're selling real estate. But I want to buy a condo, you know, in the Orlando area, we have 400,000 cash. Can you help us? And I was like, yes. Yes, yes. So that that was my way back in. That was my way back in. And then at that point, it's just, you know, it was relearning because yes, I had learned the selling part. But now it's like, earn relationship part of the business. How and close the technicalities because there's so much technology that everything changes. Everything changes. So it was time to do that. But I was going to life. I still, because unfortunately, my case, you know, I, I was in an abusive relationship as I mentioned, I divorced in 2005. But it wasn't until literally early last month that final, everything finally ended because there was an injunction. So it's been really a drain. So it's just at sometimes you wonder. And that's, but that's when I noticed, it's like, hold it. I mean, I'm still making it. Things are happening. Even in the worst days, there's always the ball is still rolling. And that's when I'm like, but what is it? And I began looking at my book of business. And it's referrals of referrals of referrals, you know, I mean, two years ago, I closed my first buyer. I closed them all over again. You know, so it's like that referral book. When you stay in touch with them, and when you do what you're supposed to do, yeah, they stay loyal. They do. And first, I also want to honor you for sharing about your challenges you've faced. And the victimization that's happened that happens to you. And the fact that you were dealing with that, but not only while it was happening, but for about 17 years or 18 years after 18 years, I mean, that is a heavy, heavy bag to carry around. And it is not an easy thing. So I honor you for carrying that bag for as long as you did. I know that's that can't possibly be easy. And also a good reminder, I think to anyone out there that that knows of maybe somebody that's that's in a similar situation that is currently in a similar situation. And maybe the people are afraid, the person's afraid to leave because maybe they don't think about how they don't understand how they could support themselves. If they were to leave a relationship and maybe they think, well, it's better to be in even an abusive one than not abusive one because at least I at least I can pay the bills in this abusive one, which of course, you know, is is not not a great place to be. And to, you know, sometimes it's just a couple of people to say, hey, I think you can do this. And so it's it's a great, great reminder to encourage people who are trapped or who feel trapped in those in those sadly abusive relationships to maybe see a pathway out. And so I honor you for sharing that week. I mean, we have thousands and thousands of listeners. I guarantee that that story is going to touch somebody and maybe even inspire somebody who might be in that situation or know someone in that situation to maybe see a different path. And so I honor you for the courage to talk about that. Thank you. And I also want to talk about the Hispanic market because I know that here in Chicago, which is where I'm located, we have a large Hispanic population. And there is a tendency because we have about 800 agents here at our own company. So I just talked to a lot of agents. And I'm always recruiting agents for our firms. I'm always talking to agents. And whenever somebody brings up the Hispanic sort of demographic for for finding buyers and sellers, a lot of times what what agents will say is, oh, well, I don't know that I don't know that market. I don't know what those what what what that group of people is looking for. I don't know how to communicate with them. I don't really know how to infiltrate or penetrate that market to really get in. And so I would love any just information or advice you might have because you're right. It is the largest minority non or yeah, minority group growing at the fastest rate in our country. So it's important to certainly not ignore that group, but learn maybe how to better communicate with that group and understand what what what their needs and desires are. So I'd be love to hear more about that. Well, in summary, because there's so much that you can do, but the the question the big question is, and most people say, well, what do I do? Just like you express it's like this. And everything that is so known, we we kind of tend to stay away from it. But it's not that hard because to begin with, you know, about 70% of the Hispanic population speaks English. You know, so that's one thing. You know, yes, will it help to speak Spanish? Well, of course, you know, of course, it will. But if you don't speak Spanish, chances are your buyer seller will speak English. Is there's a big chance? Most of the buyers right now, the Hispanic buyers are 30 and below, 30 years old and below me, which means they have been born and raised in this country. So they are you know, they know the language. It's that's the first thing. But that's about English. That's how talking about English is Spanish. But knowing that Hispanic or the Latino language, it really is more than is an English or Spanish. It's how the week communicate. What's going on in there? You know, it will help, of course, to know a little bit of maybe the basics, because you gain trust when you speak about the basics. You know, when you say a few words in Spanish, like most people will say, you know, well, I took Spanish when I was in high school. That's really, really sweet. But I have forgotten all about it. But what about if we add, but I hope that you can teach me how to, you know, that kind of you can help me remember those little nuggets, you know, that will help. That will really help. And it's also the respect, you know, because when you are honest, because honesty will be the best policy you have to be honest. If you are not, if they, if they, if we don't perceive that you're being honest, you'll be treated nicely, but that there's going to be a wall. And if it happens, that you do a transaction with that person, that's the end of it. That's the beginning and the end. Sometimes as crazy as it sounds, it might be even better not to the transaction, but keep in the relationship. Yeah, maybe even referring it for referring it to an agent who who really is immersed into that, that community. Because it's the transparency and explain the processes from A to Z. What I usually tell my buyers and my sellers, what you see is what you get. You, I'm going to tell you the good, the bad, the pretty and the ugly, you're going to know it all. And there's a lot of time spent on that orientation, whether it's the buyers orientation or the listing presentation, a listing presentation with a Hispanic is not going to last you 20 minutes. I'm sorry to tell you that. You know, it's usually not going to, because they want to get to know you. And they're, we are not going to tell us our stuff until we know that you can be trusted. Ah, that's, that's really interesting. So I was, while you were talking about that, I was thinking, I know here in Chicago, there are a tremendous number of Hispanic cultural events. There are culture, there are places where they were Hispanic people gather. There's, you know, certain events and, and, you know, experiences that they tend to have. And if I wanted to immerse myself in that culture to get more business, I would be going to a lot of those events. I'd be, I'd be in the background for a while learning about that culture, learning about how they communicate, what's important to them. And then eventually, you know, sort of working my way into opening, having them see me as a trusted advisor, but you're right. It just, it isn't going to happen overnight. It's not, that doesn't go step to begin with to get, so that's personal knowledge. So you'll get that personal knowledge. You can go to events in which you're going to meet people one on one, although I really believe, I mean, with so many Hispanics in the US right now, everybody knows at least one. I mean, everybody does. It's like, build that relationship because from that relationship, you're going to be selling to everybody. And when I mean everybody is literally, if they love you and trust you, you call them or you say, listen, I need help on these. They will. But again, you have to reimburse that. I mean, when they call you and they will call you for little things, you know, sometimes, you know, their computer broke as crazy as it sounds. You know, can you help me? Well, I have learned a lot of how computers by helping them, you know, because it is Hispanics that you family and culture. Absolutely. And family and culture are, yes, I would have, if you were to say, what would my guess be about what I know about Hispanic community, I would say family and culture as well. So that is that that brings true with my experience. I am, I am, I have a Hispanic name. I am not really Hispanic myself. My first name is Delphan and my middle name is Joaquin. So I have a Spanish from Spain, a Spain Spanish name. But anyway, but but the point is, is I was not, I didn't was not raised in that culture. And so as a result, I will, but I do know, we have, gosh, probably a few hundred of our agents are Hispanic here at KL. So, but yeah, you're right. It's it's it's about earning trust because I think what what sometimes people forget about people who come to this country or or who are in a minority group that are that are here is that they're oftentimes, and I mean, we should just be honest about it. These are, you know, Hispanic people are often treated less than non-Hispanics and and and all other minorities get treated this way too. And we have to remember, especially if we're not a minority, to remember that not everyone's treated the same. And so some some groups are going to naturally be a little bit more defensive or or that's going to take more time to earn their trust because of the way they're treated on a regular basis. And so, you know, this idea that, you know, I would it would be a great if everyone was treated the same sadly, it's not exactly the way it is yet. So, you know, earning that trust is is is not an automatic. No, it's it's not. But the reality is and that's just a little nugget. The reality is that most, which is truly interesting, I was I was looking at numbers most Hispanics right now, I mean, they are they have been American born. So that means yes, there is panics and when you get one, you get the family, but the culture is changing in the sense that there's more communication. You know, we're beginning to see beyond, you know, your D so you're that because most of them the growth of the Hispanic population since 2010 is due to Hispanics being born in America, not other not not immigration, not immigration. Yeah, that makes sense. And that opens up the that that a lot of times like you were saying sort of resolves the language barrier that could exist because the ones the second generation or the people that were born here obviously are speaking English. Maybe maybe not it's it might not be their first language, but they certainly grew up in our our school systems and learned English as well. Yeah, that makes sense. But I'm sorry. No, what I was going to say, but you it does help to communicate because once you get to them, you're going to be going home and mom and dad chances are these big Spanish. Yeah. Yeah, and you know, it's it's never been an eat. Well, I don't it's never easy to learn anyone else's language, but it's never been easier because we have these devices in our pocket that we carry around 24 seven like there's do a lingo. There's a number of of the of the learn a language apps. And you know, maybe you won't speak perfectly within a year of studying, but you'll know enough to be able to at least show the community that you're putting effort into learning their culture, their language, their traditions. And of course, Hispanic people have been traditions. It's important to honor these traditions to to be part of them to learn about them so that you can participate. Yes, anybody can be learned. I mean, it really and I say that because I moved into this country, I'm originally from Puerto Rico. And I moved in 89 and when I moved from Puerto Rico and I ended up in the Cleveland, Ohio area, I didn't know the language. Sure. I couldn't speak the language. And I understand the frustration when you're learning a second language, but I tell people if I don't know Cleveland all that well, but there couldn't have been a large Puerto Rican community in Cleveland, right? That had to be very, very small. Now, nowhere I was and I didn't, obviously I didn't know anybody, but the fun, this is just a funny story. The funny story is that I'm like, okay, I mean, I need to learn the language. So I turn on the TV because most people tell you turn on the TV and that's how you learn. Well, guess what? When I turned that TV on, what came up was the Beverly Hills Billies. And now I'm laughing about it, but I cried. I cried because it was like, I'll never be able to, I'll never be able to. Yeah, it's it is an interesting thing. If anyone ever has not had that experience of watching a foreign film or watching a television show that was a shot in, you know, in a different language, it is incredibly difficult to try to understand what's going on if you don't know the language at all, but you can learn it over time, of course, but it is that's a hard way to do it, for sure. So, so I would love to know about the ways in which you stay in touch with your sphere of influence in between transactions, right? So while you're working with a client, I assume you're speaking with them all the time, you're constantly servicing them. Obviously, you're doing a great job. But what happens? So they buy yourself a home that closes and then like, you know, maybe they don't need you for the next seven years or so until they're ready to make another transaction. What do you do to keep that relationship strong during those those times? Well, if he's the first, the first time I've done a transaction with that person, you know, I let him know throughout the process. Listen, this is coming to a close, but I'm not going anywhere. You need me, you call me. It doesn't matter what. I said, don't call me at two in the morning. But if you do, it's okay, but my phone will be on silence. But just to set that standard, that this is what you can expect. And then every now and then is more, more that the phone call at anything else. Because yes, you know, we're taught to put everything in the CRM and send this and send that. And you know what? Most people will not look at it. It will end up in the spam folder or they will unsubscribe. It's especially with the Hispanic client. And fun enough, I am the same way. So this is how I realized how it was going on. Because in my case, it's kind of the opposite when I was getting into the American culture. So it was, that's when I realized, but hold it, this is how I felt. This is what I was going through. And there's a quote that says, show me how much you care. And then we can talk. And it's literally the same thing. It literally is the same thing. It's be there. Yes, you'll be invited to the birthdays. You'll be invited, you know, to everything, you know, something is going on sometimes to be decisions, sometimes big decisions are being made. And you're called, you know, listen, what do you think about this? You know, when an innocent owner is, it can be scary. It can be scary. But I always thought people, I will never tell anyone what to do. But what does your heart tell you? But you will be asked, because they will see you as that contact, that person. And your phone will ring. There were times, in my worst times, in which it's like, okay, what's going to happen in here? Because I didn't have the mind to do anything and overwhelm and so forth. And the phone rings. And they, you talk and check it. I haven't heard from you in a while. So it's really funny because it works the opposite way. If it's been a while and you haven't made contact, you will be called because they want to know, why haven't you called? So it's really sweet. It's really sweet. I love that. And I want to make sure that the, you made a very important point that I believe you made a very important point. I just want to underline it, which was sending out email newsletters, which is very common. And I'm not here to tell you not to do that because I think there's a reason to do that. And I think there's a good reason to do that. But is that necessarily going to demonstrate to a client that you care about them? No. It's just going to demonstrate that they're on your email list and you're still in the business. And that's if that's the intention, if the intention is like, oh, this is all I need to do to stay in contact with somebody to send them a newsletter. No, that's probably not going to demonstrate to anybody that you care about them. It's just going to demonstrate that you're still in business. So like you were saying, I love that you said, hey, the transaction's completed, but I'm not going anywhere. And in fact, when you need anything, anything related to your home or anything at all, you reach out to me. And if I can't do it, I'll get you to the right person that can. That's how you demonstrate care. And that's what people, that's what everybody really wants. We don't really want another email newsletter. But it's not, it's okay to do it. Just don't make that the only thing you do and don't think that that demonstrates care. It doesn't. It just demonstrates that you're a decent marketer, but it doesn't necessarily mean that you're helping anyone. And the best that is basically set them up and forget them. That's the way I see it. And that's the way. And that's the way everybody feels when they get those emails. You don't feel special for getting a email. Even if it's a happy birthday, even if especially if it's a happy birthday email that is automated, it's like pick up the phone, call the person. They're probably not going to answer anyway. You'll get their voicemail and leave them a happy birthday message or sing them happy birthday or do something that actually demonstrates that you care. And that goes a million miles further than even, look, a text is better than an email, but a phone call. We still all love to hear somebody who, now we don't always maybe like to talk on the phone, but we love it when people reach out and say, hey, I'm thinking about your happy birthday. Yep, that's correct. Yeah, it's so much about demonstrating care, isn't it, to the client? And that's the bottom line, which is it works in reality, it works with any transaction. It really works with any client, but the, the other reality is that the, with the Hispanic client is going to, if you're resilient, if you really, if you really want that client, you're going to have to work for it. It's not going to come easy. But once, once you have established that relationship, it's yours. But then, but never take it for granted either. I wanted to ask you about the Hispanic community, specifically about first time home buyers, because I see a huge opportunity to educate certain renters in the Hispanic community who maybe had never even pursued home ownership. Maybe they didn't know how, how to do it or what was, what the process was. Maybe they were embarrassed to ask. I know that I was embarrassed to ask when I, before I bought my first place, I didn't want to ask anyone like what's a mortgage, how does it work? I was too embarrassed, because I was in the financial services world, not in real estate. But I was like, I should know this and I don't, and I feel silly asking. And, and now you can just Google everything, obviously, and learn about it. But not everybody does that. And sometimes people just, they're, their blinders are on, no one's taught, educated them. So I'm curious on the, you know, hey, moving from renting to home ownership, doing those kind of seminars, you know, bringing in, you know, inviting people in those communities that are really underserved, and teaching people about the pathway to home ownership, was that something that that you've been involved with, or do you have any suggestions about how someone may consider doing that? I have been in the past, and there's one thing to make clear. Right now, also, last year, 7.9 million Latinos were home ownership ready financially. So the reality, but again, and they will come to those things, because like, like in here, like we have, there's so many first-time buyers assistance programs available, because there are so many of them. And when they go through that program, you know, from 8 to 8, they'll get explained the process. But again, they won't really, when you approach them the first time, is I get rid of the idea that I'm going to get telling it's, and I'm going to close, in 6 months, I'm going to close these 10 people. No, no, because the same process, you start in the, you just got a heads up, a head start, but you're going to start that process of developing that relationship. And you can explain the process from 8 to 8, but if you did not build that trust, they're going to go find someone that they will trust. Yeah, that just makes perfect, perfect sense. And you know, this idea of earning trust is the way that I think is, of course, by being of service. And the, I've always thought felt that the Hispanic community, because they put so much emphasis on family. And there's so, and again, they are historically have not been treated well by people who, you know, especially first-generation have a, you know, language barrier, obviously cultural barrier, and just being seen as maybe even a threat to our country. Some people see Hispanic people as a threat, which is, which is unfortunate, but it is a reality that Hispanic people still sometimes have to deal with. And so this is really important to understand that history for anyone that really wants to serve that community, because to understand their history means you can empathize or sympathize and really get a better sense of the challenges that community faces, so that you can be of, of better service that you can feel for the struggles that they've had. And, and the reality, and another thing to, to view is, you know, what I have learned, and I'm sure everybody that's watching right now has learned as well, is, you know, the issue is never the issue. Very simple. The issue is never the issue. So something is happening. If, if I get upset, you know, it's not the client, it's me. So I better go and find out what got triggered in me, so don't personalize, just professionalize and keep it up. You know, you, you were reminding me, I'm going a little bit off, off of, off script for a moment, not that we're on a script, but just off, off the conversation, you just reminded me of a very smart thing that I've heard is spoken about in the 12-step rooms, which is, so if anyone's familiar with with 12-step programs, one of the, one of the lessons that is learned in that room was people get sober or they stop doing these problematic behaviors and find a supportive community to help them through whatever addictions they might have is they learn that when something is activated within me, it's not the event that's active. It's something like you just said, that's within me, that's being triggered, being adjusted, and it doesn't mean that whatever's happening externally doesn't matter, no, it does matter, but it's important to know that I am reacting a certain way and I can learn emotional regulation, I can learn how to, how to control my response so that I can be more supportive while this chaos is happening to my client as opposed, because the client's going to be in chaos. The client is good, especially when something goes wrong, you know this, of course, our listeners know this, something always goes wrong with every transaction, there's always a bump in the road, and during that bump, the client is probably freaking out because that's what happens, it's a large financial purchaser sale, and you can be the adult in the room and say, look, I know this feels a certain way, I know what this is, I know how to handle this, I am here to, to make sure you feel okay and, and being that guide through the emotional ups and downs. That is correct, lost at the same time, if every time you meet with that client, especially the turbine, if every time, if you're building that relationship, if you are talking, I like to tell them, like I always, like I mentioned at the beginning, the good, the bad and the ugly, you know, and third party stories, just tell them stories, listen, this, this may happen because I tell them, please throw walk on me, I don't want you to go to bed with questions, because by the time you wake up, it's going to be an nightmare. Yes, please, please, please, I want to know, you have any questions, tell me, I want to know what's going on in your mind, and if I don't know the answer, which by now I just laugh and I say, I doubt that I want, but if I don't, I will find out, I will find out, if something go wrong and I tell them, if there's something that you think may go wrong, if there's something that you're not telling me, so listen, this is a divorce course, it's going to come out, it's going to come out, so just tell me so we can deal with it, we can find the solution, because everything has a solution, so let's just talk about it and get to the bottom of it. And I think, you know, it reminded me of, when I bought my condo, not my first purchase, by the way, a couple of years ago, and I, by the way, I've been, I'm not practicing REALTOR, but I am in with REALTORS every day all day. It's all, this is my job, and I talk to REALTORS, I teach REALTORS even how to close business, and yet the day of the night before I was closing on my condo, all of a sudden, I had one of those freakouts where I was actually ice skating with my girlfriend, and I couldn't even hardly get on the ice, I go, I think I've ruined my life, I think this is a terrible decision, I don't know what I'm doing, by the way, I'm in the industry, I have a license, and I'm sitting there, and I'm like, I can't get out of this, I think I just ruined my entire life. Anyway, everything turned out fine, but the point is, is I suffered silently, I really, I mean, I told my girlfriend, but she didn't really know what to do, other than say, it's going to be okay, but what I really needed at that moment was another professional, I needed to share that with another professional, and they needed to say, everybody feels like that, don't worry, it's totally normal, you're going to be okay, I'm taking care of this, and so it's a good reminder that even people who you think, oh, they seem fine, you need to check in with them, and allow them, like you said, please throw up on me, because if you're just throwing up, like I was freaking out, and I would like, wait a minute, if I'm freaking out, it must be a real thing, because I'm in the industry, well, no, it wasn't, it was all in my head, but I didn't have anyone there to throw up on, and so as a result, I suffered, and it turned out okay, of course, but you're so absolutely right, and we forget this is REALTOR sometimes, because we always think it's going to work out, we'll figure this out, the person might not always feel the same way. Well, no, plus we need to find out, where are they coming from? Yeah. And if we know them well enough, we know whether this is the first transaction, we know whether they went for closure in the past. Right. You know, they love their home, or you know, they got denied, or they got taken by an agent, which unfortunately, it's happened. Yeah. So the more we know, when they say this, or even before they say it, because if we know, we know, we can walk a step ahead and say, listen, this is the way you might be feeling now. And I usually turn specially to the buyers after they sign the contract, it's like, listen, after we sign this, this is the process, but this is the process that we have in writing, these are the steps that are going to happen, doesn't matter what, but now let's talk about the process that you are going to go through emotionally, because this is what's going on. That is a brilliant way of saying it, and also really, really calming, because what you're doing is, of course, is you're basically validating someone's feelings. And instead of just like, oh, it's going to work out. Don't worry. I got it. It's like, I understand how you're feeling. A lot of people feel this way. You know, I'm here to guide you through. I'm, you know, I've got you. And being able to empathize with them and say, that must be a hard feeling. I get it. I hear you, I'm here to help you through it is really what, and most people aren't willing to share that without you asking, because it's embarrassing. It can be embarrassing to somebody. It can be just painful to talk about. I mean, no one wants to talk about fear, but it's there. And so what I loved about what you said is, you asked, how are you feeling about this? And if they were like, oh, my God, I'm totally freaking out. I don't think you'd be like, well, you shouldn't freak out. You should be like, no, no, I get it. Don't worry. I'm here with you. I'm not, I'm going to be the rock that you can hold on to as you freak out. And we're going to get you through. That's it. Just walk a step ahead of them. And just that, that, and no, wait, you need to know what's going on. And tell them this is, this is okay. It is okay. Or if they put a little bit of distance because people do, that tells you there's something. There is something is going on that they're scared to share. And at that point, just see just evaluate the relationship, the agent client relationship from eight to see, evaluate all those conversations because people always tell us how they feel. Yeah. They always do. So, and if you know enough, you know, and you will not be able to take off ends, even if they scream at you or whatever, because you know what's going on. And it's not you. It's just, oh, I was yelling at my girlfriend the night before she had nothing to do with the transaction. She just was in the room. So I'm like, I'm yelling. I mean, I'm not really, I'm not blaming her, but I'm yelling. Oh, I got I freaked out. And she was just like, it's going to be okay. And I was like, you don't know, you're not in the business. I'm in the business. I'm freaking out. Right. So, so it happens. And you're right, being there to really be there during those emotional moments and making sure the person feels comfortable to share those emotional moments. Boy, boy, you are, you know, they're going to tell everybody about you if if you help them during those during those tough emotional moments and that they feel comfortable enough to share. They're going to tell everybody, oh my gosh, my REALTOR is the greatest. Yeah. Plus, remind them early on that the reality is when you're going to do something new, everybody's an expert around them because I tell them, now you're going to go, you're going to tell someone that you're going to buy a house, everybody's going to be an expert. And I said, and people are well intentioned people are coming to my heart. But the reality and I tell them, like, for example, and I use the pimple story, for example, if you get a pimple, you know, everybody's telling you how to get rid of it. Everybody is. Well, the one you have to go to is a dermatologist. Right. Go to the expert, you know, because you can end up burning your face. So it's okay. But if someone tells you something that puts you on his and makes you scared, tell me, tell me and I can explain what's going on. Yeah, or just correct the information. Sometimes it's just like you said, sometimes just bad information, you know, putting toothpaste on the pimple, maybe that maybe that really hurts the skin, even though it sounds like a cool little hack to fix it. Maybe that actually would make things worse. I had a similar experience at the dermatologist few many years ago where I was reading online, people were saying, oh, you should wash your hair less. It's actually bad for the scalp to wash your hair every day. And I was like, okay, I read enough articles that said it. I just assumed it was true. I went in to go see my dermatologist who had been practicing for like 40 years. And I go, it's okay if I don't wash my hair every day, right? And he goes, no, you should wash your hair every day. And I go, no, no, I'm reading this stuff. He goes, that's wrong. Don't, no, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, maybe it's different for women and for men. I'm not here to tell you what to do. Anybody what to do. But he was like, no, well, I have, I have a skin condition. So for my particular skin condition, so maybe I don't know what the average person should, but he said, with your skin condition, you need to wash every single day. He goes, it's actually going to make it worse if you only wash your hair like two or three times a week. It's actually bad for you. And I was like, oh, he goes, yeah, don't read, if you're going to read stuff online, run it by me. I'll tell you the truth. And I was like, oh, yeah, of course. So you're absolutely right. You know, making somebody, because who knows what people read online, they can be persuaded. They can read things that, that, you know, aren't in their best interest. And they don't know it. And so that's why you as a professional are so important. So Marisol, I think this is a great, perfect place to wrap up. I do want to mention for everyone listening that Marisol works in Florida and guess where a lot of people retire to. Florida, we all know that. So at least everyone from Illinois goes down there. I know my parents are down there as well. So if anyone out there has clients moving to Florida, whether they're, you know, maybe a second home, maybe retirement, you know, maybe they're moving to the villages or one of those kind of places wherever, you know, especially if they're in central Florida, reach out to Marisol. She would love the opportunity to connect with other REALTORS. And by the way, she has clients that move other places too. So maybe you can work out a nice little referral network. And by the way too, you know, and I don't know Marisol if you're looking to expand your group, your team. But of course, if you are, people can reach out to you if they think they'd be a good fit on your team. But if you have clients, if anyone has clients that are moving to central Florida, have them reach out to Marisol because obviously she is one of the top agents in that area. So and I want everybody to follow Marisol. First go to her website, which is g12professionalgroup.com linked to that in the show notes. And follow her on Instagram. M. Justino one at on Instagram.
