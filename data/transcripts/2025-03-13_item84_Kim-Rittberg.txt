[00:01:36] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team? Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:41] I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So
[00:01:47] how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and
[00:01:51] retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local
[00:01:57] market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also
[00:02:03] looking to leave you. Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000
[00:02:08] agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded.io
[00:02:14] looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents
[00:02:20] they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but Corded's AI went and visited my
[00:02:26] recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me
[00:02:31] exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes
[00:02:37] emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are
[00:02:44] looking to grow your brokerage, Corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit Corded.io to schedule a
[00:02:50] demo again. That's Corded.io and now, onto the show.
[00:03:08] Hello, everybody. My name is Kimberly Bird. I am here to talk about goal setting with videos in
[00:03:14] relation to building your business. So if you haven't heard me before, I come on basically once a
[00:03:19] month to teach you about how to market yourself better. And I say market yourself, not market one
[00:03:24] home because you're marketing yourself. You're not marketing just that one home. So today I'm
[00:03:30] focused on fear and goal setting and hitting your goals. So this week I was a keynote speaker
[00:03:36] at the next home conference and I was thinking, oh, this would be so good to share with the keeping
[00:03:41] your real folks. And I want to dive into what does that mean? Like I think people are like, I'm not
[00:03:46] afraid of things. Well, I would like to peel back the layers and say, when there's something on your
[00:03:52] to-do list that's been there for a while, or if you're doing something, but not enough to see benefit
[00:03:57] of it, peel back the curtain and say, why am I not doing this? So what does that look like for video?
[00:04:01] So I have a lot of people come to me, they're like, I should do more video or like, I'm going to get
[00:04:06] to it. But it's been three months, six months, 12 months, 18 months. So there's something under that,
[00:04:11] right? So how do we get in, set those goals and hit those goals? So instead of being like a pie in
[00:04:17] the sky dream, it's actually an actionable goal that we're talking about. So my focus of my keynote
[00:04:24] was really believing in yourself, like envisioning a bigger goal and how do you get there? So for me,
[00:04:31] that I was working during childbirth, I was a media executive, I had worked at Netflix,
[00:04:37] a weekly, all of these like, you know, really well-known places. And when I found my small work
[00:04:42] during childbirth, I was like, well, I need a new way to do this. I need to build a new career.
[00:04:48] And it took me two years to start my own company, even though I had all the requisite skills.
[00:04:53] And I really had to say like, what am I afraid of? What are these things that I'm afraid of?
[00:04:57] So if you're looking to do video, but you're not doing it, let's sit there and say, okay,
[00:05:02] what am I, what is holding me back? Am I afraid that people will judge me? Am I afraid of how long
[00:05:08] it will take? Am I afraid of the investment? And I'm here to tell you, if you want to do it,
[00:05:12] you need to do it. And if you don't want to do it, you should do it because it's very effective
[00:05:15] business tool. So let's talk about what the things that are holding us back from doing video. So
[00:05:20] the main thing that I see for my clients is that fear of judgment. So a certain percentage of my
[00:05:26] agents, they just don't necessarily like love being on camera, whether it's talking to the camera,
[00:05:31] or even just like having it on and filming them, their voice, their face, I hear all these things,
[00:05:37] do you notice this thing on my cheek? Do you, does my voice sound too high? And the truth is,
[00:05:42] you're doing great, right? Your personality in meetings, people like you, you're a successful
[00:05:46] professional. So let's not go to that place where like, I am horrible. Like you're not horrible,
[00:05:51] you're great, right? Your business is working. So I think step back from that fear of judgment.
[00:05:57] And again, I always say this, get out of supermodel mode, where we think everyone is judging us
[00:06:01] and looking at us and step into teacher mode. A teacher is focused on her lesson plan and not her
[00:06:06] hair or her makeup or his hair or his makeup. So get out of supermodel mode, get into teacher mode
[00:06:12] and focus on bringing forth value and education. And even past that, bring people into your life and
[00:06:18] your business. The more people understand, see how you work, see what personality you have,
[00:06:23] that's what they're going to work with you. People work with people they like. So okay,
[00:06:27] let's talk about what does that look like for video? So if you are looking to get on camera and
[00:06:31] you're like, I need just like, I need to show people who I am. Then we're talking about that
[00:06:36] about me video, that sort of more polished video where you sit down and you really tell your story.
[00:06:42] Speaking of, I have my once a year on a brand shoot day. So it I call it like a real estate agent
[00:06:49] accelerator. So you come to New York City, it's really fun. You go see a show. And then the next day,
[00:06:53] you come and film with me and I interview you, I write your scripts, me and my award winning video
[00:07:00] team film and edit all of your content to present you as the leader in your industry. And I only
[00:07:05] do this once a year. Most of my work is coaching. This is my once a year done for you content. So
[00:07:11] that's a great thing to be doing. Contact me ASAP. I have one spot left. Just message me on Instagram,
[00:07:18] Kim, RITP, RG. So again, you're going to want to come forward and say, this is who I am, put your
[00:07:24] flag in the sand and say, this is who I am, this is what I'm about, this is who I serve.
[00:07:29] And so I like to say you can build your business with iPhone video. Like truly, I have a program called
[00:07:35] Video Bootcamp where I train people how to make better video with their iPhone and how to connect
[00:07:40] with clients and my agents last year, my agents have run in tens of millions of dollars in new
[00:07:45] home sales directly from video. So there's a strategy behind that is not just start talking, but
[00:07:51] once you're really confident on camera, you're able to bring yourself and your personality into it.
[00:07:56] And so I teach you how to do that with the consistency accountability. So if you're struggling
[00:08:02] with actually getting on camera, you just have to do it, right? Like message me on Instagram,
[00:08:06] I'll give you some accountability tips, but have someone in your office start asking you questions.
[00:08:13] Ask you some questions. You can go into chat, you can say, I work in Brooklyn, New York, and I sell,
[00:08:19] you know, mostly apartments from this price to this price. What are the top questions people ask?
[00:08:23] Take those questions, answer them to camera. But I find it's very, it's for my clients as much
[00:08:29] easier if you have someone asking them when you first start. So have someone in your office, like
[00:08:33] be the interviewer, film that, put it on social media. Don't over think it, you don't get more than
[00:08:38] three takes. I have a three take rule. You cannot film more than three takes. So again, cut through that,
[00:08:45] I know you're going to say it's not fear, but cut through the fear. If you have something that's
[00:08:50] on your to do list and it's not getting done, there's some reason. None of us are that busy. We
[00:08:55] can always carve out 15 minutes at some point during the week to film a video. So do what you need to do,
[00:09:02] like get in, get in the good mode, like shake it off, stretch your, stretch your body, smile,
[00:09:06] listen to some good music, get in a good headspace, and have somebody ask you some questions.
[00:09:12] So those are like the two major things I would say for video. Number one, step away from the fear of
[00:09:15] judgment, get into it. If you are looking for a done for you package, I have my about me video
[00:09:21] shoot once a year. It's in late April in New York, contact me. I only have one spot left. And then
[00:09:26] the other one is start showing up on Instagram, Instagram Facebook, LinkedIn, YouTube, wherever you're at,
[00:09:31] TikTok, start showing up, have someone in your office interviewing you. And then a couple of the
[00:09:36] other fears that I really like to break it down is the imposter syndrome. I have a lot of people at
[00:09:41] my keynote coming over and being like, oh, imposter syndrome. I feel it. That's so true. And so
[00:09:47] remember that if you're feeling less than look at what you've done, look at how many homes you
[00:09:53] sold last year, look at other jobs you've done, look at the things that you've done that were hard,
[00:09:57] that you did it and you crushed it. So really like own it, right? Don't worry, own it.
[00:10:03] Know that like you can do it and you've got this. So we're crushing through that imposter syndrome.
[00:10:09] Some people call it different things, but some people call it a brag book. I have a file called
[00:10:14] positive feedback. When I'm feeling low, I go on my Gmail, I go on positive feedback and I like look,
[00:10:19] I have one on my iPhone called testimonials. And I read back the positive things that clients
[00:10:24] or people on my speeches have said to me. And when I'm feeling low, I need that. We all need that
[00:10:28] validation and that's okay. So we're cutting through the fear of judgment. We're having a friend
[00:10:32] support us. We're cutting through that imposter syndrome fear by looking at the things we've done
[00:10:36] before and realizing if we've done it before we can do it again. The other two fears that I find
[00:10:41] are very common for myself, but more with clients. Fear of the unknown, maybe you're afraid of how
[00:10:46] much investment it's going to be, whether time or money, but like you have to build your business,
[00:10:50] you have to invest in your business to grow it. And then the other one is fear of judgment,
[00:10:56] fear of the unknown, fear of imposter syndrome, those are the major ones that I see.
[00:11:02] And then fear of failure. I think a lot of us are afraid that if we put ourselves out there
[00:11:06] and then what if no one watches that video? Well, so maybe they'll watch the second video.
[00:11:12] Maybe they'll watch the third video. You cannot build a business off of one video. You have to keep
[00:11:16] going, you have to keep going when you think nobody's watching. For me at the beginning of my business,
[00:11:19] I was showing up on social all the time. I had no idea if anyone was watching. I didn't think
[00:11:24] people were because I did not have a lot of followers originally. But I was speaking to my clients,
[00:11:28] kept at it. I see that for my agents. It doesn't matter if you have 40 followers or 500 followers.
[00:11:34] If you went into a coffee shop and someone said, hey, me, Jenny, she's the greatest agent in this
[00:11:39] area and introduced you to five new people, you'd be thrilled. So I think we have to get out of our
[00:11:44] head of like, I need thousands and thousands of followers. You don't, you need good people helping
[00:11:49] you build your sphere of influence and engaging with you. So that is goal setting and fear. That is
[00:11:55] how we are going to build a bigger business through video in 2025. My name is Kim Rittburg and
