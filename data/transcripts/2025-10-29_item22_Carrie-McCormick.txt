[00:01:16] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:20] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage, your team?
[00:01:24] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:28] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:31] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:33] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:38] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:44] and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:49] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:54] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:58] Corded AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:03] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:06] Not only does it do that, but corded AI went and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:11] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:13] So now when I'm recruiting, corded AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs
[00:02:19] and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:21] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:23] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:27] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.

[00:03:06] our longest running series on Keeping It Real outside of our regular interviews that I do.
[00:03:12] This is the Monday market minute with Carrie McCormick from the Carrie McCormick real estate group
[00:03:16] with that property.
[00:03:17] She's been diligently and faithfully here for I think five or six years every single month.
[00:03:23] And we're so grateful because she is a really very, very big producer.
[00:03:27] She's actually the biggest producer in all of Chicago and incredible history with her business.
[00:03:35] But she is aside from that.
[00:03:36] She's over 20 years of experience.
[00:03:38] She's a true superstar.
[00:03:39] She does everything from first time home buyers, veteran investors, luxury properties and developer.
[00:03:45] She is often chosen to work with developers.
[00:03:48] I live in one of the buildings where she was the agent for that developer.
[00:03:53] So I can tell you firsthand.
[00:03:55] And she is having the very best year in her entire career this year and unbelievable.
[00:04:01] She's over 300 million just just insane.
[00:04:04] So congratulations to Carrie.
[00:04:07] Welcome back to show before before we she comes on.
[00:04:11] Please follow her on Instagram.
[00:04:12] This is also something that she has a lot of a lot of attention.
[00:04:16] And in fact, my brother-in-law sent me a real and he lives in Florida and he has no idea who
[00:04:21] Carrie is.
[00:04:22] And he goes, I saw this really great property in Chicago.
[00:04:25] I don't know why I was looking.
[00:04:26] I didn't ask him to just randomly send it to me.
[00:04:29] I'm like, oh, that's my friend Carrie and he's like, you're kidding.
[00:04:32] And then I send it to Carrie.
[00:04:33] So she has this massive reach on Instagram.
[00:04:35] It's Carrie McCormick real estate.
[00:04:36] We'll have a link to that in the show notes.
[00:04:38] But like, it's amazing.
[00:04:39] My brother-in-law is watching it, which is crazy.
[00:04:41] Awesome.
[00:04:42] Yeah.
[00:04:43] Welcome back.
[00:04:45] Well, thank you.
[00:04:46] Thank you.
[00:04:47] And thank you for that incredible introduction.
[00:04:49] You know, I always love to be here with you and talk about the market and give tips and
[00:04:55] tricks to what we do.
[00:04:57] Yeah.
[00:04:58] So what's going on?
[00:04:58] What's what is in your world and in the sort of broker zeitgeist right now?
[00:05:06] Yeah.
[00:05:07] So, you know, we are headed into November.
[00:05:10] We're in Q4 of 2025.
[00:05:12] And, you know, it's interesting.
[00:05:14] I see throughout my career that once we hit Q4, we kind of start gliding into the holiday
[00:05:20] market, you know, agents take their foot off the gas, right?
[00:05:24] Because we know either people want to take their homes off the market, at least here in
[00:05:27] Chicago, because our weather starts to change.
[00:05:29] The holidays are around the corner.
[00:05:32] You know, and we kind of let our foot off the gas.
[00:05:34] But I feel like this is a time to really push hard, you know, to round out Q4, because
[00:05:41] I think that what you do in Q4 sets you up for 2025 or 2026.
[00:05:47] You know, so I just have a few, you know, tips, you know, for pushing in 20, the end of 2025
[00:05:55] here for you.
[00:05:56] And then some tips, you know, heading into 2026.
[00:05:59] So I think it's a good thing to chat about that.
[00:06:01] I think it's a great time.
[00:06:03] And I wanted to ask you, before we do that, we have rates now are pretty low.
[00:06:08] Are there a year low, at least?
[00:06:10] I think the average 30 years around 6%, which is amazing.
[00:06:15] And I know that's just kind of recently happened.
[00:06:17] Have you seen any sort of change in the number of buyers that are coming?
[00:06:22] I know it's the end of the season.
[00:06:23] And so it's kind of a goofy time for that to happen.
[00:06:26] But have you seen any change in buyer activity?
[00:06:29] Yeah, it's, you know, here in Chicago, at least locally, it's still pretty strong.
[00:06:34] We've had limited inventory.
[00:06:36] So there's still buyers that sat on the sidelines looking for the right home.
[00:06:40] And of course, with interest rates ticking down, there's definitely a need and an aggressive
[00:06:47] push here for the right home.
[00:06:49] So absolutely, definitely affects the buyers right now.
[00:06:52] They're looking for the right thing.
[00:06:54] And then of course, we still have the cash buyers in the market, which they're looking
[00:06:57] for year and deals.
[00:06:59] I think too, this is a great time to reach out to anybody that bought a home during the
[00:07:03] pandemic.
[00:07:04] And or even pre-pam dynamic, because their values have probably gone up.
[00:07:08] And rates are now not so awful where you were like, I don't want to give up my 3%, which
[00:07:13] I am in the process of doing.
[00:07:14] And I'm, you know, I don't want to give that up either, but 6% is not that bad.
[00:07:18] Or at least I'm comfortable with that.
[00:07:20] And you get a little bit of a discount maybe even right now.
[00:07:23] So this is a great opportunity to call sellers and just say, hey, let's re-appraise your
[00:07:28] place.
[00:07:28] What's it worth?
[00:07:29] How much have you made?
[00:07:30] And do you want to move?
[00:07:31] Right?
[00:07:32] I think now is a time to have that conversation before the spring market, maybe.
[00:07:35] And then, you know, if these rates stay where they are, we're going to have a very, very
[00:07:38] busy spring market.
[00:07:39] So agree, agree.
[00:07:41] So here's some pushes that I would recommend for the end of this year.
[00:07:45] The first and foremost is I'm going to take my own advice on this one is re-engage with
[00:07:50] your database, right?
[00:07:51] You know, we've got a plethora of clients, like you just mentioned, whether it was during
[00:07:55] the pandemic or even this year, last year, it's a great time to re-engage with your database
[00:08:02] and especially during the holidays, right?
[00:08:05] Because again, a lot of agents take their foot off the gas, they try to coast towards the
[00:08:09] end of the year.
[00:08:10] This is the time that you push on the gas and you do a lot of marketing, especially to
[00:08:16] your current database.
[00:08:17] You know, you do personal check-ins, handwritten cards, of course, is always a nice touch.
[00:08:24] Year end market updates.
[00:08:25] Talk about how the market performed in 2025, what the expectations are in 2026.
[00:08:31] Again, this is a great time just for informational purposes to reach out to your clients.
[00:08:37] Also, I did this this past weekend, is an audit of your current listings and your pipeline.
[00:08:44] Take a look at what your listings are right now.
[00:08:46] If they're not moving, if they haven't moved in 30 or 60 days depending on where your
[00:08:50] market is, identify what needs to be repositioned, right?
[00:08:54] So something needs to change if it's not selling.
[00:08:57] Is it pricing?
[00:08:58] Is it marketing?
[00:08:59] Does the property need to be staged?
[00:09:01] Take a look at the feedback that you've received from all of your showings and go back
[00:09:06] to the seller and do a quick recap with them and say, okay, you know, we haven't sold.
[00:09:10] This is my suggestions.
[00:09:13] Don't always lead with price because a seller always thinks, you know, what are you doing
[00:09:17] for me versus, you know, you want me to reduce my price.
[00:09:20] So, you know, I always do it as a team effort.
[00:09:23] You know, why don't we do a price reduction to X?
[00:09:26] And when we do that, I am going to double down on marketing and this is what I am going
[00:09:31] to do.
[00:09:31] So you approach it as a team effort.
[00:09:34] Not just asking for a price reduction, but, you know, this is what I'm going to do as
[00:09:38] well.
[00:09:38] So, again, reposition, reevaluate your current listings.
[00:09:42] I think that is important.
[00:09:45] And then since again, we're headed towards the holidays.
[00:09:47] It's time to amplify your holiday marketing, right?
[00:09:50] So again, emotion during the holidays is high.
[00:09:55] Good or bad is high.
[00:09:56] So this is the time you want to step in and talk about, you know, the holidays and what
[00:10:02] you're thankful for, etc.
[00:10:05] Holiday content always performs exceptionally well.
[00:10:08] You know, it's very visual whether you're in a winter market like I am, you know, and
[00:10:14] just talking about fireplaces and cozy corners and, you know, different things like that
[00:10:19] really can drive the emotion behind what's important in a home.
[00:10:26] Yeah, I love all that.
[00:10:27] I wanted to ask you, this is just a totally apropos of nothing question, but I'm curious
[00:10:33] how you handle this.
[00:10:35] I've noticed that in the last several years we have wallpaper has come back, right?
[00:10:40] Wallpaper is very prominent.
[00:10:43] And I have this feeling that people have very specific feeling about wallpaper and really
[00:10:49] really cool.
[00:10:50] Wallpaper is in right now, really cool and very prominently sort of bright colors or interesting
[00:10:56] colors and patterns.
[00:10:57] And it's cool.
[00:10:57] I like it.
[00:10:58] I also know that like when I see a place that I'm trying to buy and I see wallpaper, I'm
[00:11:03] like, oh, now I have to deal with that.
[00:11:05] Now again, it's a, it's a solvable problem.
[00:11:09] But what do you typically recommend to a seller who's got like a really unique wallpaper,
[00:11:14] which they think is cool and maybe it is cool.
[00:11:17] But does that, does that get in the way of a showing or just even being seen online?
[00:11:22] Yeah, you know, it really does depend on the wallpaper because there's some gorgeous
[00:11:27] bold, you know, wallpapers and et cetera.
[00:11:30] But again, it really depends on the wallpaper.
[00:11:34] But I typically, especially if it's in a powder room, we'll leave it because it's such
[00:11:40] a small space.
[00:11:40] Kind of works, yeah.
[00:11:42] 
[00:11:42] Well, it kind of works and it's, it doesn't, it's not the main part of the home.
[00:11:46] If the wallpaper covers, I always think like where do you spend 90% of your time, your
[00:11:50] kitchen, your living room, your family room, those main areas or your master bedroom,
[00:11:55] primary bedroom, sorry.
[00:11:58] You know, like those main spaces, really the client needs, the new buyer needs to visualize
[00:12:03] them living there.
[00:12:04] And wallpaper can really distract from that.
[00:12:06] And as painful as it is to tell someone to remove their wallpaper, you know, I always
[00:12:11] say, you know, it's going to self quicker, it's going to sell for more money, you've got
[00:12:14] to neutralize it and I leave it up to the client.
[00:12:18] Another tool is, is to virtually stage the room, meaning if you take the picture with,
[00:12:24] you know, the hot pink wallpaper with, you know, birds all over it, you know, you, again,
[00:12:28] you can virtually remove the wallpaper so you can show someone a visual of what that
[00:12:34] looks like.
[00:12:35] Oh, that's a great point.
[00:12:35] Yeah, I mean, at the very least do that, I would think, because you just don't want,
[00:12:39] so people have weird, sort of psychologically dissatisfying reaction to wallpaper they
[00:12:45] don't like.
[00:12:45] And all of a sudden, now they think negatively.
[00:12:47] And they yes, they can fix it.
[00:12:49] But yeah, I agree.
[00:12:51] I think, I've seen really beautiful places with wallpaper where I go, I would have to
[00:12:55] remove that.
[00:12:56] And now I'm now thinking about stuff I don't really want to do.
[00:12:59] And maybe there's something else it doesn't have that.
[00:13:01] And it's the same reason why I used white linens, which I have white linens just coincidentally
[00:13:06] for my bed spread and my pillows, it's because I, Zillow told me that if you use white bed
[00:13:10] spreads, people click on it more.
[00:13:12] I was like, if I had a blue one, I would have tossed it out and got a white one just for
[00:13:16] the photos.
[00:13:17] So I will always say just do whatever gets more, make it easy for people to say yes to
[00:13:22] come see you here, but now a chat GPT and you can probably just make it white anyway.
[00:13:27] Like you were saying, probably just change the color of it anyway without actually changing
[00:13:31] the color.
[00:13:32] Well, I think those, those are great suggestions.
[00:13:34] And carry this, this is, so are you, are you, you're optimistic for next year as well?
[00:13:39] You feel like it's, it's going to be a good year.
[00:13:41] I really am, you know, our market, again, I know a market is very local, but the market
[00:13:46] here in Chicago for this year has been very strong.
[00:13:50] Limited inventory buyer sentiment is, is positive.
[00:13:55] So I really feel like 2026 is going to be a great year here.
[00:13:59] But there are, you know, things that we as brokers need to do to plan ahead for next year.
[00:14:05] And I'm just going to give you a few tips on that.
[00:14:07] Great.
[00:14:08] So one is to create a data driven business plan.
[00:14:11] And what that means is using predictive analytics to identify kind of your marketing, you
[00:14:19] know, who your buyers are, who your sellers are going to be, really look at your KPIs and
[00:14:25] which is key performance indicators.
[00:14:27] I don't know, people know what that is.
[00:14:29] Listing volume, your GCI, your referral rates, your marketing ROI.
[00:14:33] So really kind of drill down on your marketing, I'm sorry, on your business plan and have
[00:14:38] key indicators so you can measure it along in 2026.
[00:14:43] I still have a hard time saying that.
[00:14:44] The other thing I think is going to be important for brokers is to double down on your personal
[00:14:49] brand and your SEO.
[00:14:51] Make sure that you really look at your Google business page, your YouTube, chat GPT,
[00:14:57] do your own search of your name and see how you rank.
[00:15:00] You know, all of that's going to be important for your bios, your keywords.
[00:15:05] So just do like an audit across all online platforms to see how you are ranking and to
[00:15:11] see how you are tracking.
[00:15:14] Because that's what buyers and sellers are doing.
[00:15:16] So you need to do that yourself and make sure everything is cohesive.
[00:15:20] So again, double it down on your personal brand.
[00:15:25] Also pay attention to your visuals that you have online.
[00:15:29] Buyers are consuming information visually first, of course, right?
[00:15:33] They're online, they're looking at everything.
[00:15:35] So from photography to videography to whatever type of marketing that you're doing, make
[00:15:42] sure that you take it up a notch, right?
[00:15:45] So again, you know, whatever you're working on, take a look at it, audit it, make sure
[00:15:50] that everything is perfect.
[00:15:52] Because again, buyers are not talking to you first.
[00:15:55] They're online and they're making a decision online whether or not they're going to
[00:15:59] work with you or whether they're going to come see that property.
[00:16:02] They are making a decision in their mind already.
[00:16:06] Yeah, I think that's a great point.
[00:16:08] So having brand colors, having a brand sort of style guide.
[00:16:14] And by the way, if you don't have one, you can hire somebody to create this with you.
[00:16:18] There are branding specialists and you know, you don't have to spend thousands and
[00:16:22] thousands necessarily.
[00:16:23] There are places where people all over the world can do this, but certainly local people
[00:16:27] can as well.
[00:16:28] And I think when you have that, now all of a sudden you have as a marketer, that's what
[00:16:32] I am.
[00:16:33] I am, I love having style guides and I like having colors.
[00:16:37] And that way it just makes all the future decisions a little bit easier because you don't
[00:16:42] have to really worry about, oh, what's my base color?
[00:16:44] Oh, it's this particular hex code blue.
[00:16:47] Oh, I already know that.
[00:16:48] So now I can just kind of color that everywhere or be used as the backdrop.
[00:16:52] And you are really, your Instagram is really evident of you, you have a very particular
[00:16:58] aesthetic and it's very intentional.
[00:17:01] It's very professional.
[00:17:02] You really put a lot of energy and cost and time into it.
[00:17:07] And there's bears fruit like my brother in law finding you.
[00:17:11] I don't know where.
[00:17:12] And it wasn't because you know, he and I are connected that it sent him this.
[00:17:16] He was founded on a totally different social network where he and I are not even connected.
[00:17:20] So that's the reach of social media.
[00:17:22] And I think you're right.
[00:17:24] So yeah, lots of video this year.
[00:17:25] Remember everyone's watching TikTok.
[00:17:27] They're not even maybe not even watching Instagram as much anymore.
[00:17:30] I think everyone's going to TikTok or at least the younger people are.
[00:17:33] And boy, if you know, you can be on there and have some videos hit, you'll, you'll do
[00:17:38] well.
[00:17:40] Keeping up with everything.
[00:17:41] Like you mentioned with Instagram or whatever online platform is your strength is, you
[00:17:47] know, also don't get too comfortable with it.
[00:17:49] You know, it's everything's changing so quickly and you have to pay attention to the consumer
[00:17:55] as well and do an ROI at audit on your social.
[00:18:00] So I think just to kind of wrap up, I think Q4 isn't about just closing out the year.
[00:18:06] It's about setting the rhythm for for 2026, right?
[00:18:09] For the next year.
[00:18:11] And I think that for agents who are very consistent with their marketing, they're consistent
[00:18:17] with their follow through, they understand the systems that are out there and they're
[00:18:22] consistently involving, I think, you know, you are going to accelerate in 2026.
[00:18:28] So just don't glide out.
[00:18:29] There's the rest of the year.
[00:18:30] Step on the gas plan for 2026 and make sure it's the best year.
[00:18:36] And odds are you have more time right now to do that.
[00:18:37] So don't do the thing that most agents do, which is they take their foot off and they
[00:18:42] breathe a little bit more.
[00:18:44] Do that a little bit and work a little bit harder and you'll be great.
[00:18:48] You'll be set up for the spring market.
[00:18:50] All right.
[00:18:51] Well, we appreciate Kerry.
[00:18:52] Great episode.

[00:18:58] On behalf of Kerry and myself, thank you to our audience for sticking around.
[00:19:01] This is our biggest remember on the show as well.
[00:19:04] And the reason for that is that you tell a friend that our audience does that.
[00:19:08] And we ask you to do that for us as well.
[00:19:10] I'm continuing on that really would help us get in front of more and more REALTORS who

[00:19:17] And also support sponsors of the reason we can keep doing these episodes.
[00:19:21] So with that being said, leave us a review by the way, too.
[00:19:24] Like asking your clients to leave reviews on Google Business and Zillow.

Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io. And now, onto the show. Welcome to Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide and your host through the show today on the show is our monthly series, our longest running series on Keeping It Real outside of our regular interviews that I do. This is the Monday market minute with Carrie McCormick from the Carrie McCormick real estate group with that property. She's been diligently and faithfully here for I think five or six years every single month. And we're so grateful because she is a really very, very big producer. She's actually the biggest producer in all of Chicago and incredible history with her business. But she is aside from that. She's over 20 years of experience. She's a true superstar. She does everything from first time home buyers, veteran investors, luxury properties and developer. She is often chosen to work with developers. I live in one of the buildings where she was the agent for that developer. So I can tell you firsthand. And she is having the very best year in her entire career this year and unbelievable. She's over 300 million just just insane. So congratulations to Carrie. Welcome back to show before before we she comes on. Please follow her on Instagram. This is also something that she has a lot of a lot of attention. And in fact, my brother-in-law sent me a real and he lives in Florida and he has no idea who Carrie is. And he goes, I saw this really great property in Chicago. I don't know why I was looking. I didn't ask him to just randomly send it to me. I'm like, oh, that's my friend Carrie and he's like, you're kidding. And then I send it to Carrie. So she has this massive reach on Instagram. It's Carrie McCormick real estate. We'll have a link to that in the show notes. But like, it's amazing. My brother-in-law is watching it, which is crazy. Awesome. Yeah. Welcome back. Well, thank you. Thank you. And thank you for that incredible introduction. You know, I always love to be here with you and talk about the market and give tips and tricks to what we do. Yeah. So what's going on? What's what is in your world and in the sort of broker zeitgeist right now? Yeah. So, you know, we are headed into November. We're in Q4 of 2025. And, you know, it's interesting. I see throughout my career that once we hit Q4, we kind of start gliding into the holiday market, you know, agents take their foot off the gas, right? Because we know either people want to take their homes off the market, at least here in Chicago, because our weather starts to change. The holidays are around the corner. You know, and we kind of let our foot off the gas. But I feel like this is a time to really push hard, you know, to round out Q4, because I think that what you do in Q4 sets you up for 2025 or 2026. You know, so I just have a few, you know, tips, you know, for pushing in 20, the end of 2025 here for you. And then some tips, you know, heading into 2026. So I think it's a good thing to chat about that. I think it's a great time. And I wanted to ask you, before we do that, we have rates now are pretty low. Are there a year low, at least? I think the average 30 years around 6%, which is amazing. And I know that's just kind of recently happened. Have you seen any sort of change in the number of buyers that are coming? I know it's the end of the season. And so it's kind of a goofy time for that to happen. But have you seen any change in buyer activity? Yeah, it's, you know, here in Chicago, at least locally, it's still pretty strong. We've had limited inventory. So there's still buyers that sat on the sidelines looking for the right home. And of course, with interest rates ticking down, there's definitely a need and an aggressive push here for the right home. So absolutely, definitely affects the buyers right now. They're looking for the right thing. And then of course, we still have the cash buyers in the market, which they're looking for year and deals. I think too, this is a great time to reach out to anybody that bought a home during the pandemic. And or even pre-pam dynamic, because their values have probably gone up. And rates are now not so awful where you were like, I don't want to give up my 3%, which I am in the process of doing. And I'm, you know, I don't want to give that up either, but 6% is not that bad. Or at least I'm comfortable with that. And you get a little bit of a discount maybe even right now. So this is a great opportunity to call sellers and just say, hey, let's re-appraise your place. What's it worth? How much have you made? And do you want to move? Right? I think now is a time to have that conversation before the spring market, maybe. And then, you know, if these rates stay where they are, we're going to have a very, very busy spring market. So agree, agree. So here's some pushes that I would recommend for the end of this year. The first and foremost is I'm going to take my own advice on this one is re-engage with your database, right? You know, we've got a plethora of clients, like you just mentioned, whether it was during the pandemic or even this year, last year, it's a great time to re-engage with your database and especially during the holidays, right? Because again, a lot of agents take their foot off the gas, they try to coast towards the end of the year. This is the time that you push on the gas and you do a lot of marketing, especially to your current database. You know, you do personal check-ins, handwritten cards, of course, is always a nice touch. Year end market updates. Talk about how the market performed in 2025, what the expectations are in 2026. Again, this is a great time just for informational purposes to reach out to your clients. Also, I did this this past weekend, is an audit of your current listings and your pipeline. Take a look at what your listings are right now. If they're not moving, if they haven't moved in 30 or 60 days depending on where your market is, identify what needs to be repositioned, right? So something needs to change if it's not selling. Is it pricing? Is it marketing? Does the property need to be staged? Take a look at the feedback that you've received from all of your showings and go back to the seller and do a quick recap with them and say, okay, you know, we haven't sold. This is my suggestions. Don't always lead with price because a seller always thinks, you know, what are you doing for me versus, you know, you want me to reduce my price. So, you know, I always do it as a team effort. You know, why don't we do a price reduction to X? And when we do that, I am going to double down on marketing and this is what I am going to do. So you approach it as a team effort. Not just asking for a price reduction, but, you know, this is what I'm going to do as well. So, again, reposition, reevaluate your current listings. I think that is important. And then since again, we're headed towards the holidays. It's time to amplify your holiday marketing, right? So again, emotion during the holidays is high. Good or bad is high. So this is the time you want to step in and talk about, you know, the holidays and what you're thankful for, etc. Holiday content always performs exceptionally well. You know, it's very visual whether you're in a winter market like I am, you know, and just talking about fireplaces and cozy corners and, you know, different things like that really can drive the emotion behind what's important in a home. Yeah, I love all that. I wanted to ask you, this is just a totally apropos of nothing question, but I'm curious how you handle this. I've noticed that in the last several years we have wallpaper has come back, right? Wallpaper is very prominent. And I have this feeling that people have very specific feeling about wallpaper and really really cool. Wallpaper is in right now, really cool and very prominently sort of bright colors or interesting colors and patterns. And it's cool. I like it. I also know that like when I see a place that I'm trying to buy and I see wallpaper, I'm like, oh, now I have to deal with that. Now again, it's a, it's a solvable problem. But what do you typically recommend to a seller who's got like a really unique wallpaper, which they think is cool and maybe it is cool. But does that, does that get in the way of a showing or just even being seen online? Yeah, you know, it really does depend on the wallpaper because there's some gorgeous bold, you know, wallpapers and et cetera. But again, it really depends on the wallpaper. But I typically, especially if it's in a powder room, we'll leave it because it's such a small space. Kind of works, yeah. Well, it kind of works and it's, it doesn't, it's not the main part of the home. If the wallpaper covers, I always think like where do you spend 90% of your time, your kitchen, your living room, your family room, those main areas or your master bedroom, primary bedroom, sorry. You know, like those main spaces, really the client needs, the new buyer needs to visualize them living there. And wallpaper can really distract from that. And as painful as it is to tell someone to remove their wallpaper, you know, I always say, you know, it's going to self quicker, it's going to sell for more money, you've got to neutralize it and I leave it up to the client. Another tool is, is to virtually stage the room, meaning if you take the picture with, you know, the hot pink wallpaper with, you know, birds all over it, you know, you, again, you can virtually remove the wallpaper so you can show someone a visual of what that looks like. Oh, that's a great point. Yeah, I mean, at the very least do that, I would think, because you just don't want, so people have weird, sort of psychologically dissatisfying reaction to wallpaper they don't like. And all of a sudden, now they think negatively. And they yes, they can fix it. But yeah, I agree. I think, I've seen really beautiful places with wallpaper where I go, I would have to remove that. And now I'm now thinking about stuff I don't really want to do. And maybe there's something else it doesn't have that. And it's the same reason why I used white linens, which I have white linens just coincidentally for my bed spread and my pillows, it's because I, Zillow told me that if you use white bed spreads, people click on it more. I was like, if I had a blue one, I would have tossed it out and got a white one just for the photos. So I will always say just do whatever gets more, make it easy for people to say yes to come see you here, but now a chat GPT and you can probably just make it white anyway. Like you were saying, probably just change the color of it anyway without actually changing the color. Well, I think those, those are great suggestions. And carry this, this is, so are you, are you, you're optimistic for next year as well? You feel like it's, it's going to be a good year. I really am, you know, our market, again, I know a market is very local, but the market here in Chicago for this year has been very strong. Limited inventory buyer sentiment is, is positive. So I really feel like 2026 is going to be a great year here. But there are, you know, things that we as brokers need to do to plan ahead for next year. And I'm just going to give you a few tips on that. Great. So one is to create a data driven business plan. And what that means is using predictive analytics to identify kind of your marketing, you know, who your buyers are, who your sellers are going to be, really look at your KPIs and which is key performance indicators. I don't know, people know what that is. Listing volume, your GCI, your referral rates, your marketing ROI. So really kind of drill down on your marketing, I'm sorry, on your business plan and have key indicators so you can measure it along in 2026. I still have a hard time saying that. The other thing I think is going to be important for brokers is to double down on your personal brand and your SEO. Make sure that you really look at your Google business page, your YouTube, chat GPT, do your own search of your name and see how you rank. You know, all of that's going to be important for your bios, your keywords. So just do like an audit across all online platforms to see how you are ranking and to see how you are tracking. Because that's what buyers and sellers are doing. So you need to do that yourself and make sure everything is cohesive. So again, double it down on your personal brand. Also pay attention to your visuals that you have online. Buyers are consuming information visually first, of course, right? They're online, they're looking at everything. So from photography to videography to whatever type of marketing that you're doing, make sure that you take it up a notch, right? So again, you know, whatever you're working on, take a look at it, audit it, make sure that everything is perfect. Because again, buyers are not talking to you first. They're online and they're making a decision online whether or not they're going to work with you or whether they're going to come see that property. They are making a decision in their mind already. Yeah, I think that's a great point. So having brand colors, having a brand sort of style guide. And by the way, if you don't have one, you can hire somebody to create this with you. There are branding specialists and you know, you don't have to spend thousands and thousands necessarily. There are places where people all over the world can do this, but certainly local people can as well. And I think when you have that, now all of a sudden you have as a marketer, that's what I am. I am, I love having style guides and I like having colors. And that way it just makes all the future decisions a little bit easier because you don't have to really worry about, oh, what's my base color? Oh, it's this particular hex code blue. Oh, I already know that. So now I can just kind of color that everywhere or be used as the backdrop. And you are really, your Instagram is really evident of you, you have a very particular aesthetic and it's very intentional. It's very professional. You really put a lot of energy and cost and time into it. And there's bears fruit like my brother in law finding you. I don't know where. And it wasn't because you know, he and I are connected that it sent him this. He was founded on a totally different social network where he and I are not even connected. So that's the reach of social media. And I think you're right. So yeah, lots of video this year. Remember everyone's watching TikTok. They're not even maybe not even watching Instagram as much anymore. I think everyone's going to TikTok or at least the younger people are. And boy, if you know, you can be on there and have some videos hit, you'll, you'll do well. Keeping up with everything. Like you mentioned with Instagram or whatever online platform is your strength is, you know, also don't get too comfortable with it. You know, it's everything's changing so quickly and you have to pay attention to the consumer as well and do an ROI at audit on your social. So I think just to kind of wrap up, I think Q4 isn't about just closing out the year. It's about setting the rhythm for for 2026, right? For the next year. And I think that for agents who are very consistent with their marketing, they're consistent with their follow through, they understand the systems that are out there and they're consistently involving, I think, you know, you are going to accelerate in 2026. So just don't glide out. There's the rest of the year. Step on the gas plan for 2026 and make sure it's the best year. And odds are you have more time right now to do that. So don't do the thing that most agents do, which is they take their foot off and they breathe a little bit more. Do that a little bit and work a little bit harder and you'll be great. You'll be set up for the spring market. All right. Well, we appreciate Kerry. Great episode. As always, we are so grateful to you. And on behalf of the audience, thank you.
