[00:01:31] to join your brokerage or team? Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:37] But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I
[00:01:45] go powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:51] are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:57] to leave you? Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents.
[00:02:03] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:02:07] Corded.io looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you
[00:02:13] which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but Corded's AI went and
[00:02:19] visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI
[00:02:25] tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even
[00:02:31] writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now if you are
[00:02:38] looking to grow your brokerage, Corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit Corded.io to schedule a

[00:03:39] business, please introduce them to this podcast. We'd love to have them as a listener. All right,
[00:03:44] guys, you're the best. Let's get to the main event. My conversation with Sam Coddle.
[00:03:59] Okay, today on the show, we have Sam Coddle with Living in Tampa,
[00:04:04] brokered by eXp in Tampa, Florida. Let me tell you a little bit more about Sam. Now in 2020,
[00:04:12] Sam moved his family across the country to Florida where he got his real estate license
[00:04:17] and jumped in the deep end. He quickly discovered that making searchable videos on YouTube would be his
[00:04:23] ideal way to find clients. Now Sam has three children and a thriving real estate business that is
[00:04:29] positioned to grow even more. Sam is now excited to help other agents achieve the exact same success
[00:04:35] that he has through YouTube and he's created a course. And that course is the website for that
[00:04:42] course is RE YouTuber.com RE for real estate YouTube with an R at the end, YouTuber.com will have a
[00:04:50] link to that in the show notes, RE YouTuber.com. And also I really encourage everyone watching to
[00:04:56] check out Sam's client facing website, which is living in Tampa FL.com. And as you guessed it,
[00:05:04] it's all about if you're moving and living in Tampa, what you need to know. So living in Tampa
[00:05:09] FL.com link to that as well in the show notes, along with Sam's social channels and his YouTube
[00:05:14] channel. So we want you to subscribe to all of his stuff. Sam, welcome to the show. Thanks DJ. Super
[00:05:20] excited to be here. Super excited to talk to I think you're the very first person we've ever had on.
[00:05:26] Boy, I hope I'm not wrong from Tampa. And I should remember because I go down there a lot. I was
[00:05:32] telling Sam beforehand, my sister lives there. And so I have a lot of a lot of Tampa time, but I think
[00:05:37] you might be the very first Tampa agent, although my brother in law is also an eXp agent funny enough.
[00:05:43] I just remembered that he's on the commercial side. And he is not he does not get the invite to be
[00:05:48] on the show as much as I love him. Only because he does commercial. And I don't think our listeners care
[00:05:54] that much about commercial, but technically I do know one other broker in Tampa, which is my brother
[00:05:59] in law who I is great. But Sam, yeah, excited to chat about you. My my first question is because
[00:06:05] you know, this is still a relatively new new wish career for you. And you have built a lot of content
[00:06:12] in that, you know, four years will say, right? And again, if everyone watching or if you're driving
[00:06:18] obviously don't do this, but if you're if you're alone and you could do this, go to living in Tampa
[00:06:22] fl.com and just kind of take a look at the content that Sam posts his YouTube channels there. And you
[00:06:28] can also see some of the thumbnails and you'll get a good idea of what he's doing. And and Sam is
[00:06:33] certainly not the first agent in the country to sort of apply the strategy. However, 99 probably
[00:06:40] 0.9% of agents don't do any of this. So even though it's it's not maybe a brand new strategy in 2024,
[00:06:48] it is still a super effective and relevant strategy. And probably in whatever local market you you're
[00:06:55] in, that probably nobody is doing this. So this is a great thing to learn. So we're super. And by the
[00:07:00] way, Sam can teach you how to do this as well, are you tuber.com. But Sam, let's let's start at the
[00:07:05] beginning sort of what, you know, what got you into real estate? Yes. So I the 10 years prior to
[00:07:11] getting into real estate, I worked for a big nonprofit in Colorado and did anything you can imagine
[00:07:17] for them. But I kind of became known as the guy that wants to build something build something new
[00:07:22] scale it and then move on. I wasn't really the manager type, more of a builder. So I got a lot of
[00:07:28] opportunity because of that. I was also the one that would ask like, I remember my second year I
[00:07:34] was there. Can I like, can I come to the board meeting? And they're like, no, but I just wanted the
[00:07:41] exposure. I'm like, I want to go in the deep end to see what it's like. And I've just always been
[00:07:47] that kind of person that asked for opportunities. I started helping them acquire some real estate and
[00:07:52] realized, I think I want to do real estate next. And just kind of always knew that was next,
[00:07:58] then during the pandemic, all kinds of transitions were happening with all kinds of employers.
[00:08:02] And had a chance to just make them move. And we took the jump. Wow. How do you how do you enjoy
[00:08:08] Florida? I know Florida is such a, you know, such an interesting place because of course, right now,
[00:08:14] it's probably not the best time to be right now, by the way, where it's August 6th with the time
[00:08:18] of recording this. So probably not the easiest time to be in Tampa because of, of course,
[00:08:24] the weather and it's tough, but the rest of the year, amazing summertime can be tricky. But
[00:08:28] are you getting used to the humidity and the heat or not quite yet? Yeah, I'm pretty used to it.
[00:08:33] I like it. You just, you adapt to sweating. I just have extra clothes in my truck all the time.
[00:08:39] I just know I'm, if I do three clients in a row, I'm going to have to change clothes.
[00:08:44] Least shirt because I'm starting to have some fumes. Well, we were in Chicago. And yesterday,
[00:08:51] the humidity was almost 90% and even though it wasn't super warm, I was like 78 degrees, which
[00:08:57] it felt like 90 degrees. And I was sweating within minutes of just walking around. So I,
[00:09:02] I get that every time I go to Florida, I'm, I asked my sister once, I go, when did you get used
[00:09:07] to the humidity? And she's like, you never get used to it. You just learn how to cope with it.
[00:09:10] Yeah, you just stopped complaining about it. Because also last year, I think was kind of like my
[00:09:16] initiation year to Florida. I had a car accident and I had a house flood. Oh, so I think I'm
[00:09:22] passed that stuff now. Hopefully, I still own that house. I have renters in there. And the water
[00:09:27] yesterday was five feet from the front porch. Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Wow. Well, my sister,
[00:09:34] yeah, my sister's okay. We checked in. There was obviously the big storm. So yeah, glad that,
[00:09:39] glad that it didn't come in. And there's, there aren't basements and there aren't a lot of basements
[00:09:43] in Florida. So what it comes in, it comes in and it does. Yeah. Well, sorry, you had to deal with
[00:09:49] that. That's okay. Yeah. Last year. Well, I made, I made content about it. Of course, you know,
[00:09:54] what? Thank you for mentioning that. And let's talk, let's, let's dive into that. So when I see
[00:10:00] content from REALTORS and when I see most video content, the majority of the video content I see
[00:10:06] is on social media. So we're talking about reels, stories. And you know, we're talking Instagram,
[00:10:12] TikTok, Facebook, even maybe LinkedIn and YouTube, maybe some shorts, things like that. But most,
[00:10:18] most agents really aren't utilizing much of YouTube. Maybe they upload a video once in a while,
[00:10:22] but there isn't really a strategy there. Right. They tend to have strategies around short form
[00:10:26] video on social media. But what I love is that, you know, you took this awful thing about,
[00:10:33] you know, getting, you know, having your house flood and realizing that, oh, this happens to
[00:10:38] other people too. Maybe it's a good idea to share sort of my experience. So can you talk about
[00:10:44] your, talk about your business? Because you do things a lot differently. I mean, as a REALTOR,
[00:10:49] obviously, you do things similarly. And that way, but in your marketing, it's really very different.
[00:10:54] Yeah. My business coach has this analogy. I really like, he says Marilyn Manson and Taylor Swift
[00:11:00] are very similar. They couldn't be more different, but they do all the same things. They,
[00:11:04] they write songs, they record songs, they promote them, they sell tickets. Like it's all kind of
[00:11:09] the same stuff, even though the packaging is very different. My business is YouTube. That's mostly
[00:11:16] what I do in the business at this, at this point is make YouTube videos and build out processes for
[00:11:21] our clients to come through. But it's videos that are, are being searched for already. And that's
[00:11:27] the biggest difference with something you're saying about other platforms. People are going on to
[00:11:31] YouTube, not just your grandparents, but you, every listener is searched for something to learn on
[00:11:39] YouTube. It's the, it's the second biggest search engine behind Google. And, and so we,
[00:11:46] we don't think of social media as much that way. Obviously, you can search on Instagram and,
[00:11:53] and TikTok, I guess, but you're really just passive most, most of the time, you're probably just
[00:11:57] passively getting whatever they send to you. Whereas on YouTube, yes, you can get that passive
[00:12:02] stuff too, but that search engine is, is so it's, it's bigger than YouTube search, or sorry,
[00:12:07] bigger than Yahoo, bigger than Bing. It's literally huge. And that was the approach from the beginning.
[00:12:14] Hey, I'm going to play this, figure out this game and play this game, not tell anybody I'm doing
[00:12:19] it, not send this link to anybody. And I published my first video the next day, it had 23 views.
[00:12:25] And I was like, wow, 23 strangers found my video. I did it. Like, that's what it felt like,
[00:12:32] that dopamine hit of those first views. I'm like, I'm publishing three videos a week now. Like,
[00:12:36] I'm going fast. I didn't have any clients yet. I wasn't busy. Like, let's go for it. And then
[00:12:43] it's very topical things. It's like, somebody's moving across the country. What are they going to
[00:12:48] search for? What is it cost to live there? Where are the best schools? Then they're going to get more
[00:12:52] and more narrow as they go. Best suburbs around Tampa. Best neighborhoods in Wesley Chapel.
[00:12:59] Like, they're going to get more and more narrow, but it starts to really broad. The top of the
[00:13:03] funnel starts to really broad and it gets more and more narrow. And you can get as niche as you'd
[00:13:08] like because anyone moving into any neighborhood might be searching for maybe best restaurants in
[00:13:16] XYZ neighborhood, or it could even be sort of non or real estate adjacent kind of stuff. It might
[00:13:22] just be useful information like you said schools could be retailers, could be restaurants, could be
[00:13:29] parks, it could be really anything. Because I know like when I moved into my most current condo and
[00:13:35] it was in a new neighborhood that I hadn't a neighborhood that was new to me, I didn't even know
[00:13:39] where the closest park was. And one day I'm like, I was just about to close on. I got to curious
[00:13:43] where the closest park is. And I googled it and I actually went to YouTube and I said, where are
[00:13:49] I actually did it on YouTube because I wanted to see what the parks looks like. So somebody had made
[00:13:53] a video said here are the parks in Wicker Park. And so I this is such a great, great idea because
[00:13:59] of course people search, I know when I go on vacation, my dad and I went on a trip to Ireland
[00:14:05] several years ago and what we did, we traveled all over the country. And the night before we would
[00:14:10] the night before the next day for our itinerary that following day, we went on YouTube. We said,
[00:14:17] what are the most interesting things to do in XYZ City. And that's how we knew what to do. And so
[00:14:23] what you're talking about is exactly sort of what we did on vacation. And when I moved into my
[00:14:29] condo here in Chicago, I was like, okay, show me the cool restaurants, where the parks, things like
[00:14:34] that. So I love this. Yeah. And then answering the specific questions that you know your clients
[00:14:40] already ask, is there a trader Joe's nearby? How far is it from the airport? How far is it from
[00:14:44] the beach? How far is it from downtown? Like actually just answering the question, showing the map,
[00:14:49] traffic's going to be bad at this time. Be careful. Like those that like hyper local kind of data,
[00:14:55] people really, really want and really search for. Oh, I have an idea for you if you haven't
[00:14:59] already done this. Because I don't know if this is an off Florida. I know it's in Tampa. Some of the
[00:15:05] intersections have six minute lights. And I know that's a big thing in Tampa. And it's it's weird if
[00:15:10] you're not used to it. Nobody's told you you're like, there's something wrong with these lights.
[00:15:14] So like that could be a video is like get ready for six minute lights at some intersection.
[00:15:19] Well, and if you live in that specific zip code, your car insurance is going to be double everybody
[00:15:23] else's too. Is it right? That's why those lights are so long is because it slows down traffic so
[00:15:28] much more. Right. Yeah. That's fascinating. Those little quirks. Yeah. But but again, like I remember when
[00:15:34] somebody said to me, I go, Dana, what's my sister? Like, why are the lights so long? She's like,
[00:15:39] that's a traffic thing. And I go, yeah, but that's a really unique solution. I'm like, I got to look
[00:15:43] that up. And I never did. I don't think it's the right solution. Well, certainly not fun to sit in. But
[00:15:48] it is something people who are moving to Tampa should probably know. So, you know, what's so cool about
[00:15:54] what you're doing is the content is kind of it's somewhat unlimited in sense because anytime a client
[00:16:01] who is moving to Tampa that you're working with, you know, you can just catalog all the questions
[00:16:06] they ask you and those can all be videos. Right. Or it's one video where I'm telling a story of
[00:16:12] them, Hey, these person, this family came and they needed these three things. If you're like them,
[00:16:18] give me a call and let's get into these things. Like, the call to action is even just built into
[00:16:23] there. And that call to action is where a lot of people miss in their content in general. Like,
[00:16:28] no, tell them to call you, tell them you want them to call and you're going to answer. And you have
[00:16:33] an awesome process and you want to help more clients like all that. I love that. Let's talk about
[00:16:39] the production of videos because I think we've made a pretty simple and strong case that people
[00:16:45] search for for specific questions on YouTube and you can make content around that. But a lot of
[00:16:50] people are going to a lot of our listeners are going to feel a little intimidated. You know, with
[00:16:54] gosh, I don't I'm not a post production person. I don't have a camera crew. I don't know how to
[00:17:00] edit, right? So curious about sort of what that learning curve was. If you're doing it, if you're
[00:17:06] if you're having other people do it and sort of what you're any suggestions you have for people
[00:17:11] that are starting this process. Sure. I started it with my phone. There was not much of a learning
[00:17:17] curve for me there, though, because I had had some experience with video production, had traveled
[00:17:21] into some other countries and shot some documentaries. So that that part wasn't intimidating to me.
[00:17:26] It is for a lot of people. But starting with your phone, adjusting your settings to kind of be
[00:17:31] optimized for that, which I'd love to show anybody exactly what to do for that. And doing it like
[00:17:38] that is it's very approachable. People are not in like upset that you're using a phone.
[00:17:42] Right. You can make it look great, especially if you're outside in a recognizable
[00:17:47] Tampa looking place or wherever your city is. Like your phone can do a great job.
[00:17:52] When it comes to editing, somebody asked me recently, hey, I'm looking at hiring an editor,
[00:17:56] but I want to edit my videos for a while. So I know if I'm hiring a good editor.
[00:18:01] I'm like, first of all, don't do that. Just hire an editor. Because if your aunt came to you and said,
[00:18:05] hey, I want to sell my house, but I want to get my license and I want to sell a few houses first
[00:18:10] before I choose a listing agent, you would say, no, don't do that. It's the same kind of thing.
[00:18:17] I love that. That's that's really, really smart. So this idea, it also too, I was listening to Mr.
[00:18:25] Beast. If you don't, if for our listeners, anyone who doesn't know, Mr. Beast is the number one
[00:18:29] you two, right? I think he's number one as far as most most a list do he puts out a video and gets
[00:18:33] like 90 million views within a few days. It's incredible. And he, I was reading a book that his
[00:18:40] his coach wrote about sort of talked a lot about his process. And he said, Mr. Beast does a little
[00:18:46] blurb in the book. And he's like, your first hundred videos are going to be garbage. And he's like,
[00:18:50] you just don't worry about it. It's just, it's just what's going to happen. Go ahead and push him
[00:18:55] out anyway, because you're going to get better. And every single video, you're going to get just a
[00:18:59] little bit better. And once you get above a hundred videos, which sounds like a lot, maybe it won't
[00:19:03] take a hundred, but whatever that number is, like the first hundred episodes I did of this show
[00:19:07] were probably garbage. So, so I can, I can understand that process, but not having the expectation,
[00:19:13] like you were saying that it has to be perfect. You know, people really just care about content
[00:19:17] more than they care about production, right? And YouTube above other platforms is very forgiving.
[00:19:24] They're people are subscribing and along for the journey to see you grow. Now, you're going to have
[00:19:31] what I look back at my first videos and they still get views. So I'm not going to take them down.
[00:19:35] But what I was saying was so like basic, simple and surface. Now when I tell a story,
[00:19:41] it's a little more dynamic. It has some layers to it. Like I have more clients to tell stories about.
[00:19:46] Like it evolves and people aren't there for it. Yeah. And so your first video got 23 views the
[00:19:54] first night, which, which is again, amazing that somehow people found that you weren't promoting it.
[00:19:59] And then sort of how did it, how did it grow from there? And again, I want to make, make a point
[00:20:04] before we do this is that I've had over the years, I've had a few other people who do have a
[00:20:09] similar process to Sam. And by the way, Sam will teach you exactly how to do this. REYouTuber.com is
[00:20:15] where you go to learn. Sam has a course. It's amazing. He's going to show you exactly everything he knows.
[00:20:21] And when I've had a few other people who have done this over the years, I don't think I've had
[00:20:25] anybody who does it this year. So I'm glad to have Sam on today. And one of the things that they
[00:20:31] have mentioned is that these videos, one thing that how they're different from social media. And of
[00:20:37] course, this just may not occur to our listeners. Of course, Sam knows it is the content lives
[00:20:42] forever. He talked about it. My first videos are still up there. Why? Because they still get views.
[00:20:47] They still are relevant for people who are searching. Now, social media stuff is pretty digestible
[00:20:54] and then forgotten. It's disposable for the most part. It's really hard to have anything, you know,
[00:20:59] really take hold on social media. But I want to say that, you know, when you look at Sam's videos,
[00:21:04] he's getting lots of views. But he's not getting Mr. Beast numbers. And he doesn't need to. He totally
[00:21:11] doesn't need to. If you even get a thousand views, and I know usually your videos do way more than
[00:21:16] a thousand, but even if you got a thousand, I'm curious, do you happen to have an idea of how many
[00:21:21] views for you it takes on average to like get a lead? Now, I don't know if you have that number
[00:21:27] in mind, but I'm just not a curiosity. It's probably not a super high number of views. No, it's
[00:21:32] probably a hundred is it's actually that's amazing. Lower than people think. And I think there's
[00:21:36] actually a problem whenever your video becomes too big, a video that has 50,000 views, you seem
[00:21:42] unreachable. You seem less local like all those kind of things that you do want to feel. Yeah,
[00:21:47] there's really a sweet spot. I think about 5,000 subscribers and about 1200 views of video is like
[00:21:53] a sweet spot to be in. You're still a regular guy that's doing well, I guess is maybe the way
[00:21:58] that people see it is like, Oh, I could I could probably talk like I can't get Mr. Beast on the phone.
[00:22:03] He's not going to take my call, but I might be able to get Sam and the reality of it is Sam,
[00:22:08] once my business, anyway, right? That's yeah, the money is of course in the transaction. Do you
[00:22:14] speaking of money when you're talking about cost of producing these videos? Do you spend a lot of
[00:22:20] money to make them or are they relatively inexpensive? I said hire an editor hire an editor
[00:22:25] somewhere else. My editor is in India and she's growing in agency. I refer people to her all the time.
[00:22:31] She's great. She sent me a cold email. I was already doing it editing it myself and I pay her $150
[00:22:38] a video. She's good on style, good on timelines. Like we keep it rolling. That seems very
[00:22:47] reasonable for a video. My lender pays for it too. Even better. Sam just said something really,
[00:22:53] really important is of course you can have strategic partnerships with other providers and this is
[00:23:00] where you hit up your lender especially and maybe a title company or maybe a whatever and you say,
[00:23:05] hey, maybe I can and I don't know if you have a way that you promote their services on those
[00:23:10] videos or however the situation is or you just give them your business, but you can work out
[00:23:15] an arrangement so that they cover that cost or some of the cost at least. Right. Yeah, who else could
[00:23:20] gain from a buyer? Typically a lender who else could gain from a seller? Typically a title company.
[00:23:26] So there's great ways to leverage those relationships. And lenders and title companies have deep,
[00:23:32] deep pockets for anyone who doesn't already know that title companies are the forgotten
[00:23:37] sort of partner. So definitely reach out to them. You can also do a state planning attorneys.
[00:23:43] There's divorce attorneys. There's financial advisors. There's insurance agents. A million different
[00:23:49] sort of adjunct kind of professions that feed into what we do in real estate. So I love that.
[00:23:57] And then once you build enough of a brand and enough reputation, like we have a new title company
[00:24:01] we're partnering with and they're like, here's your budget. We're like, what kind of reporting
[00:24:05] do you guys want? They're like, we trust you guys. Like, let's try something. Okay. Love it. Yeah.
[00:24:10] Well, yeah, don't know if you're if they're getting business from you or not. Yeah, they're like,
[00:24:13] let's try for six months. I'm like, okay, great. And title companies make ends. I don't know what it
[00:24:18] it might probably change from state to state, but here in Illinois, maybe thousands and thousands
[00:24:23] of dollars on even just one transaction. Yeah. Again, that may not be the same in every market, but
[00:24:27] it is big, big money here. And that's where you know, you can hit them up. So I love that. So you
[00:24:34] let me go back to something you said about the content being evergreen because I like this
[00:24:39] analogy I've been I've been working on. You go into the library and it's full of books that stay
[00:24:46] there. They were they're they're useful to people all the time at the entry to the library. There's
[00:24:52] something else. It's a newspaper stand. Those change every day. Yeah. They're topical. They're
[00:24:59] based. They're trying to be catchy. You know, if it bleeds, it reads, right. That's that's the
[00:25:04] clicky social media right there in the front. I'm trying to build the library. I don't care about
[00:25:09] the the newspaper. You don't want to put a new newspaper every day on one of those big wooden sticks.
[00:25:17] No, of course not. And that's that's a really great point because you know, people people also
[00:25:24] go to the library or YouTube to learn about how to fix their dishwasher. How to that I've got,
[00:25:32] you know, my girlfriend had a leak in her dish or her dishwasher was leaking and she goes,
[00:25:37] you know, I probably should figure out what's going on. And I said, just go to YouTube. There's,
[00:25:40] you know, put it put in your like type of dishwasher you have and just say common issues or leaks or
[00:25:45] whatever. She figured it she she found a video within a minute. And then of course it's all
[00:25:49] the problem. Yeah. And that video will live forever. And that video probably had 120 views or
[00:25:53] something. But everybody that watched it found some value in it. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I love
[00:26:00] that. So you do three videos a week. Let's talk about shooting the videos. So you you you you
[00:26:06] do you still use your phone or do you have different equipment at this point? I'm way in like overkill.
[00:26:11] I'm not kind of so. Um, I would make certain recommendations like I would recommend either either
[00:26:16] either sticking with a phone and adding a microphone or upgrading to like the DJI Osmo pocket three.
[00:26:23] That's like a gimbal. Correct. Yeah. A little gimbal camera. And the creator combo comes with
[00:26:28] a microphone. It's like you could do everything with that. You don't even need a drone. Like you
[00:26:34] people prefer drive by footage over drone footage anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Drone footage is is yeah.
[00:26:40] It can be very cool if done perfectly. But yeah, I think that I I brought to prefer to see drive by it
[00:26:46] and in your your stats also verify that the drive by stuff. So what a gimbal is everyone is just
[00:26:53] basically a a a pivoting system that you can hold that keeps your camera or your phone stable.
[00:27:01] So you can move around and it's not jiggling around or or making people sick to their stomach. So
[00:27:06] it's reasonably inexpensive. The one you're talking about like maybe it's 150 bucks at most is
[00:27:11] probably less than that. But it's great because you just basically can hold it and it'll keep it
[00:27:16] stabilized for you. Yeah, that's the one that you would use your phone with. If you get the one with
[00:27:20] the built in camera and the creator combo, I think it's around 800. But you know, yeah, because
[00:27:24] you would never need anything else. Gotcha. Like you'd be set with that. But so I don't do three videos
[00:27:31] a week anymore. I started with that. Then I went down to two a week and I did that for three years.
[00:27:36] Now I do one a week and I do more comprehensive videos longer longer form video.
[00:27:41] Correct. So they're they're typically I mean, they're always over eight minutes, but they're
[00:27:45] typically over 15 minutes. Wow. So let's let's talk about length because video length because
[00:27:54] there's lots of misconceptions about, you know, how long a video should be. It should be under two
[00:27:58] minutes or it should be longer. And the real what's been your experience because you have to look
[00:28:03] at the metrics. You have to look at when people are, you know, when are they signing off the video,
[00:28:08] when are they leaving the video? Are they leaving it at two minutes? Obviously not if you're making
[00:28:12] these longer form videos. Should people be concerned as long as content is really strong,
[00:28:17] should they be concerned about how going too long? I know they should not be concerned about going too
[00:28:23] long. They should be concerned about is the content actually good good enough to be this long.
[00:28:29] And that's that's a real question. That's where you keep people engaged. So my average
[00:28:34] the view duration percentage is around 45%. So most of the audience drops off by then. And 40 and
[00:28:43] people want that to be over 40%. Got it. Yeah. So that's the sweet spot is you want to get it. And
[00:28:50] let's I want to talk about the pitch real quick because you talked about asking for the business. But
[00:28:56] if most of the people are dropping off midpoint, are you putting the pitch in along the way or you
[00:29:03] saving it to the end or just yeah, because you do you do say there's a call to action. Where do you
[00:29:08] sort of insert that beginning, middle and end everywhere? Yeah. And people people take it too
[00:29:14] seriously. So I break it down into three elements. Number one, ask for ask for them to call like
[00:29:23] tell them who you are have some kind of value proposition. I always say this is the living in
[00:29:28] I'm saying with the living in Tampa channel, we make these videos for you about what it's like to
[00:29:32] live and move to Tampa. We're also a team of REALTORS and we want you to call us. So call
[00:29:37] text or email anytime. It's actually us that answers. And then the final part of this is I say what
[00:29:43] will happen next after you reach out. We'll schedule zoom call or phone call and just process your
[00:29:48] situation and see how we can best help. Once I started adding that last part, people would start
[00:29:53] texting and saying, send me the link to set up a zoom call with Sam. Yeah, let's so Sam did
[00:30:00] something very elegant and could be easy to miss is he presupposed in his statement that they
[00:30:07] were going to take that next step. He said, Hey, when you do this, here's what's going to happen next.
[00:30:12] He didn't say if you do this, he said when you do this, because that presupposition there is
[00:30:16] that they're going to do it. So that had a that had an impact. And then at the end, I say, if you
[00:30:22] got value out of this, if you made it to the end of this video, I want to hear from you whether you're
[00:30:26] going to buy yourself right now or two years from now, give us a call. Yeah, because if they watch
[00:30:31] all the way through, they must have liked it. And they now they go, Hey, this guy knows at least a
[00:30:37] little bit. I stayed 15 minutes on a video. You're not going to do that if you don't appreciate the
[00:30:41] content. And now, yeah, you want to hit them at the end. And also, I do that too at the end of our
[00:30:45] show because we get a drop off percentage as well, like like any podcast. And I always say to
[00:30:52] the end, if you made it to the end, like, like we love you, please tell everybody about us.
[00:30:56] Yeah. Which is our call to action. But in fact, in fact, I'll say it now, please tell everyone
[00:31:01] about us. Okay, that's the end of my page. But tell everyone about Sam too. If you know other
[00:31:05] agents that I'm telling you guys, this is the, I truly believe, I'll give you a personal example.
[00:31:10] So I'm a recruiter for for REALTORS. The biggest mistake I've made over the 14 years I've been
[00:31:17] recruiting agents. And we have almost 800 agents. And I'm very proud of that. But we should have
[00:31:21] like 2000 agents by now. And the reason why we don't, maybe it's because I'm not a very good
[00:31:26] recruiter. But it could also be because, and I believe this to be true is I don't have a lot of
[00:31:31] video content for what REALTORS are looking for specifically around maybe choosing a brokerage
[00:31:37] or maybe learning what different brokerages offer or maybe just tips. Here's a good REALTOR tip
[00:31:42] of the day. Or here is, you know, whatever, I don't have a lot of that content. So people have to
[00:31:48] seek me out, which is not the always the easiest thing because there's hundreds of real estate firms
[00:31:53] here in Chicago. There's 46,000 REALTORS in the area. So one of the things my big initiative is
[00:31:58] basically to do exactly what Sam is talking about, which is to create longer form content on YouTube,
[00:32:05] specifically answering questions, REALTORS. We call them brokers here in Illinois. So if I said
[00:32:10] brokers, I want to just make sure to us, that's a REALTOR in Illinois. So I know it's not that way in
[00:32:14] every state, but I want to answer that the questions REALTORS have. And guess what? Nobody's making
[00:32:19] that content here locally. And so if you're if you're looking to increase the number of teammates that
[00:32:25] you have, if you're on a team, this is a way, it could be a way to do it as well. But I get really
[00:32:31] excited about this because I think it's just such an untapped, there's so much untapped potential.
[00:32:36] And I'm also curious to if you ever take your videos, your long form YouTube videos,
[00:32:42] and then chop them up into short form bites that you could then send out on Instagram, Facebook,
[00:32:50] TikTok, these sort of more short form magic moments of the 15 minute video.
[00:32:55] No, I don't. I'm I'm playing one game with those videos and I don't want to pretend like it's
[00:33:00] repackaged. It's it's as valuable. Also, the people that follow me personally on Instagram are
[00:33:07] friends and family and REALTORS. They're not people that are trying to move to Tampa,
[00:33:12] typically that are following me there. So I want to engage with that audience a little bit differently.
[00:33:17] That that makes a lot of sense. So Sam just I want to just reiterate what Sam said because he said
[00:33:20] something very, very important. He goes, you know, hey, my social media people who follow me,
[00:33:25] they're really people who already know me. And there's nothing wrong with showing them some of my
[00:33:28] content, but it's really not for them. It's for the people that don't yet know me and YouTube's
[00:33:32] going to be the place where they're going to most easily find that. So I'm going to focus all my
[00:33:35] energy and in one channel and also too. So sticking to YouTube probably helps you focus a lot
[00:33:41] better. Like I know we push this podcast out to all the major channels and it makes sense to do
[00:33:46] that because it's not really difficult for us to do that. But if you were to say, hey, DJ,
[00:33:50] how often are you on TikTok answering fan requests? I'm like never. So so that's probably not good
[00:33:55] because somebody writes a comment on one of my videos and I don't even respond, right? So so it
[00:34:00] does make sense to hyper focus in one area. I would say go where your customers are for Sam's
[00:34:05] customers. They're going to YouTube for learning about Tampa. I want to go back in one other thing
[00:34:11] up to you asked about kind of the production process. A lot of people get behind in this because
[00:34:17] they don't have videos ready. I have like videos in different stages all the time, you know,
[00:34:23] from random ideas I've jotted down to like I started to like write a bit of the outline to
[00:34:28] the outlines ready to go to it's like shot already. So having ideas in the pipeline that are ready
[00:34:36] to go to where I go to shoot if I'm you know running early for an appointment. I'm in this suburb.
[00:34:41] Let's set up the camera real quick. Let's shoot this video. Oh, I could shoot a broader video about
[00:34:45] suburbs to while I'm here. And if those are ready, then I'm just like looking at the outline and
[00:34:51] going for it. Are you writing like each word of your script or is it just a general outline and then
[00:34:57] you sort of just you know instinctively know what to say. Yeah, it's very very rough. Sometimes
[00:35:05] I'll write down five words. I've never written a script. I've never read from a teleprompter. I
[00:35:11] want this to feel very unscripted. I want to have the moments where I'm like looking off and like
[00:35:16] thinking of what I was going to say and I want all that I want all that to happen on camera because
[00:35:21] all that also lets people get to know you. And they know that you're a real person and you're not
[00:35:26] reading from a script. And we all know that when it's very hard to read from a teleprompter and
[00:35:32] sound natural just is it is difficult. So really you've got a rough you've got questions you
[00:35:38] want to those are going to be the titles of your videos. These are the answers to the questions
[00:35:44] that people are asking you have a rough outline of like okay, there's like three or four ideas I
[00:35:49] want to maybe tackle within this video. And then you just talk. And then the editing process. Now
[00:35:55] I know you have a woman helping you overseas. Are you doing a lot of quick edits? I know that's a
[00:36:02] real common popular style. Are you doing more longer form edits where you just kind of go and go
[00:36:06] and you're not cutting every few seconds? It depends in the beginning it was like it was getting
[00:36:12] cut every few seconds because I was saying um or pausing or things like that trying to think of
[00:36:16] what I was going to say. It's a lot more fluid now where you know there's a cut every 30 seconds
[00:36:21] kind of a thing because you want to let that story kind of come out naturally. And my editor kind
[00:36:27] of understands the style and and we use we use like frame IO to review those videos and you can
[00:36:33] leave comments on very specific time codes. And I you know explain all of that in detail that takes
[00:36:40] time with an editor. People are get one one video done and they're like my editor didn't do it
[00:36:45] the way I want like well you probably didn't give them enough instructions but also tell them how to
[00:36:49] do the next one. Go ahead and publish that one. Tell them how you want to do the next one.
[00:36:52] Yeah. Have you ever been surprised at the number of leads that have come in from a video that
[00:36:58] you thought? I don't know if anyone's really going to pay too much attention to this. I guess the
[00:37:03] reason I'm asking this is we have these ideas that we think are the idea. We're like okay I got it
[00:37:09] this is going to be the one that gets me all my leads. I can't wait to do it and then we can get
[00:37:13] very disappointed. Like I've done that on the show. I used to have Zillow come on every every
[00:37:18] every month as a corporate Zillow and I sort of I like Zillow so I'm not a Zillow is the worst evil
[00:37:25] company ever but there are a lot of agents that don't like Zillow and I was like this is good oh I
[00:37:30] also had Facebook coming on every month to talk about what they offer to REALTORS like literally
[00:37:35] you know Menlo Park Facebook was on my show. I was like this is going to this is going to skyrocket
[00:37:40] my success. I got Facebook. I got Zillow. Yeah people didn't really care. They only really cared
[00:37:46] when I talked to people like you and said how do you do this and I was like oh okay well so as
[00:37:51] that ever happened where you put a video together and it either exceeds your expectations or just
[00:37:56] just does it. Yeah definitely and I want to answer Jake's question in the the YouTube comments.
[00:38:02] The topic we're talking about is YouTube for real estate and the video that really surprised me
[00:38:08] with the feedback was I I moved to a bigger house on an acre and I'm like I want more clients that
[00:38:15] want to buy a house like this because it's kind of fun to shop for and so I was like what it's
[00:38:20] like to live on an acre around Tampa. I love it and people I mean we've got we've closed five
[00:38:26] deals from that video. Wow in the past three months and people are like I saw that video about
[00:38:32] living on an acre around Tampa. I didn't even know that was possible and they're moving from St.
[00:38:37] Petersburg. They just want more space. It's like okay great. I love that and so with Tampa what
[00:38:46] people who maybe aren't familiar with Tampa areas you have St. Peter St. Petersburg nearby.
[00:38:50] You have clear water nearby. There's there's a bunch of really desirable kind of fun areas that
[00:38:55] are adjacent to Tampa. Are you branching out into those areas as well because I guess you would
[00:39:01] have to assume that you're willing to drive there to do deals or maybe find a partner that you could
[00:39:06] work within those areas but are you trying to keep it really narrow so that you're not driving
[00:39:12] even three kids you're busy. What's sort of the thought process with where you're doing these?
[00:39:17] Yeah so pretty early in the business I found a partner that didn't have kids and that
[00:39:21] had ambition so that he could drive to those places and it's been a great growth journey through
[00:39:29] that but we work about a 40 mile radius all around like when people are moving here from across
[00:39:34] the country Tampa is this big. Yeah to people to your sister that lives in South Tampa Tampa is this
[00:39:40] big. I only know South Tampa. I don't know anything outside of South Tampa. I go to South Tampa like maybe
[00:39:45] four times a year. Not every like so I realize like locals really view these areas so small. Yeah
[00:39:53] and I being an outsider I can tell that story from an outsider perspective. Yeah. The locals talk
[00:39:58] about it like this but it's actually like this like that is something I really tapped into in my
[00:40:03] videos like let me be you because I was you four years ago I moved here from across the country
[00:40:08] and all these things surprised me. Are you as far as just metrics as far as people want to know how
[00:40:16] many leads and I don't you don't have to share with us you know all of all of you know your metrics
[00:40:21] but are we talking about you know are leads being generated on every week every month you know
[00:40:28] sort of how do you think about you know tracking the success of the video. Yeah I don't track it
[00:40:34] per video I just look at the year look at the volume but let's talk about the actual numbers so I
[00:40:39] started January 2021 first video that year that April I closed the first first deal from YouTube
[00:40:47] and I closed 13 deals from YouTube that year. It's amazing. The next year we closed 25 deals from
[00:40:52] YouTube so it's 2022 2023 we closed 44 deals from YouTube and this year we've closed about 35 so far
[00:41:00] and you have a lot about almost half the year left so that is right you are definitely exceeding
[00:41:06] and we have other lead sources now in the business we're doing some cold outbound stuff we have a
[00:41:11] little bit more reputation the leverage to get listings and it's it just keeps growing but also
[00:41:22] that space people don't just call about a $300,000 house they call about a $3 million house too. Really?
[00:41:29] that's amazing and did you make a specific sort of intention to start trying to relate to those
[00:41:36] higher net worth individuals. I did and I had a few reach out and I was like how do I find more people like you
[00:41:42] I wear T-shirt and the best question you could ever ask a client that you want to duplicate. Yeah I need I
[00:41:48] need to find more people like you if you were me how might you do that. I'm like I like you you like
[00:41:52] me how do I find more people like you people love that question. It's great it's like the most
[00:41:56] flattering thing you could say to somebody. Yeah he's like you know I liked that you were chill that
[00:42:00] you were wearing a video wearing a t-shirt in your videos that you're obviously doing it yourself
[00:42:04] you're hustling and he this one guy he was like I don't know if you'll find a lot more people with
[00:42:09] my net worth like okay never mind so then I started just talking more about those high high dollar
[00:42:16] areas not apologizing about them being the what they cost they cost what they cost right you're either
[00:42:22] one or one or not and it's not up to me to to make some kind of judgment about that it's expensive
[00:42:28] or cheap or it's whatever yeah and also too like even though you know I made that by at home in a
[00:42:35] certain price point what I can afford I still like to look at some of these more luxury homes I mean
[00:42:40] look HGTV has made a lot of money off previewing you know a really expensive home so even though
[00:42:47] people may not you know be in that particular market maybe they'll share it with somebody they know
[00:42:51] who is in that price point or who's thinking of moving or hey this is in my neighborhood check out
[00:42:55] this house or yeah do you I have a question about about getting people reaching out to you maybe
[00:43:04] outside of the Tampa area even though your videos are really hyper local specific to Tampa
[00:43:09] does it ever happen or someone's like you know I'm actually I'm in Montana and or somewhere else
[00:43:15] and they're like you're really great but can you help me find someone or is that ever happened?
[00:43:19] Yeah usually with an existing client maybe they need to sell where they are we can help them find
[00:43:24] a listing agent or it was helping a client's daughter yesterday she's buying a house in Ohio
[00:43:29] helped her find an agent and I'm not so concerned about getting referrals on that I'm concerned about
[00:43:36] getting raving fans that leave I want I'm now I'm gonna call Lisa later today and say hey can
[00:43:41] you leave a review saying I also helped your daughter in Ohio when I didn't have to
[00:43:47] and she'll love to leave that review I love that so so it's also an opportunity to create some
[00:43:55] some partnerships with agents in feeder areas people I'm sure you probably have a better sense now
[00:44:01] of where people who move to Tampa might be moving from whether it's you know retirees moving down
[00:44:07] there whether it's people from I don't know I don't know where people move to from Tampa my sister
[00:44:11] moved from New York and that was because of a job thing but I don't really know where those
[00:44:15] feeder markets are so you probably have figured that would it ever make sense to make videos about
[00:44:20] those feeder markets like yeah yeah yeah yeah so in within the YouTube analytics you can see where
[00:44:26] your traffic's coming from specific states so even just making comparative videos about those
[00:44:31] states is really valuable cost of living in New York versus Florida or cost of I mean we have a
[00:44:37] lot of use from Illinois most are New York though it's Florida and New York as for most of our
[00:44:41] views are coming from yeah and that makes sense and and now Sam can make videos saying hey
[00:44:46] thinking of moving from you know from Chicago down to Tampa here's everything you need to know or
[00:44:51] from New York to Tampa or Atlanta to Tampa whatever he can literally just create the question
[00:44:58] and do you ever look up before you before you make a video are you also checking to see how many
[00:45:04] people are searching for that particular phrase prior to making a video a little bit you know
[00:45:11] in the beginning you rely on those tools a lot after a while like I make very straightforward
[00:45:17] titles and dumb nails like I'm not playing like a clickbait game right I'm playing like hey this is
[00:45:23] what this video is about like you either wanted or not and I'm okay with that so I don't play the game
[00:45:29] as much as I used to but in the beginning it's really important to like look at where is the most
[00:45:34] volume where's the most search volume and how do I get in front of those people I want to just
[00:45:40] make this point you did 45 sales in your 30 year yeah that's I sort of even just kind of missed
[00:45:48] the importance of that as you said it I didn't it didn't hit me and I just realized just how amazing
[00:45:53] that really truly is we have 800 agents here I know what people do in their 30 year and it's not 45
[00:45:58] deals it is rare for somebody to unless they just their network is just insane and they just you
[00:46:04] know maybe they grew up here whatever you didn't grow up there you moved there and you and theory
[00:46:08] shouldn't be able to do 45 deals on your 30 year because people should people shouldn't know about
[00:46:13] you enough and yet they do because of this of this YouTube and you don't have to really I mean yes
[00:46:19] you have to leave your house to shoot the videos but ultimately these videos run 24 seven who knows
[00:46:24] I bet you have leads that come in at two in the morning sometimes and yeah yeah it's a interesting
[00:46:30] yeah last year was an interesting year because I kept hearing every REALTOR struggling you know
[00:46:36] sales are down transaction counts the lowest it's been I'm like I don't know like my I
[00:46:41] my doubles I don't know what's happening and I don't say that to brag guys I'm like I'm very
[00:46:46] thankful that I put in the work to build the the thing when I when I did because it's the work that
[00:46:51] leaves to the opportunities not like you just identify this opportunity you're like I'm going to
[00:46:55] get it no you work to have that opportunity to have that luck per se like it's actually just hard
[00:47:02] work that leads to that and this is a this is a marathon I mean making YouTube videos is
[00:47:08] certainly yes you can get lucky want maybe and go viral although you know just assume that's never
[00:47:14] going to happen because it doesn't need to happen it doesn't need to happen to build to build a
[00:47:19] good business and have people reach out to you I mean look we have tens of thousands of listeners
[00:47:24] for our show and that's amazing and we need those kind of numbers to be able to continue but like
[00:47:28] Sam doesn't need tens and I mean probably has tens of thousands of followers but but the reality
[00:47:34] of it is he just needs like he said 100 views on on a video might get him a lead that's pretty
[00:47:40] doable if you have great content and then I wanted to ask one last question about search engine
[00:47:45] optimization specifically to YouTube and that's its own industry how important is it to make sure
[00:47:52] you have your tags correctly your title correct and any other SEO you know probably things within the
[00:47:58] video as well that need to sort of be a certain way how important is it to really understand the
[00:48:02] SEO of YouTube it's important but people tend to think about that a little more than they should
[00:48:10] yeah they're like I'm going to figure that out I'm going to make sure to 100 out of 100
[00:48:14] I I did this test once where I was uploading a video and I'm like I'm not going to do tags
[00:48:20] now I look back and call this a test it was really just me being like I don't know if tags work
[00:48:25] I'm not going to do any I got a notification a week later from YouTube saying hey people are
[00:48:30] really watching this video we're going to push it to a broader audience wow and they give you a
[00:48:35] kind of a warning because your analytics go down your click through it goes down because they push
[00:48:40] it to people that aren't searching for it right and but that was the first time I did zero tags
[00:48:45] so I'm like I yeah I don't think they work well I I tagged tons and tons of videos it doesn't
[00:48:53] I must be doing it wrong because it doesn't seem to work on YouTube for me although I'm not the
[00:48:58] expert at all but there are multiple games in YouTube number one is getting it to just show up
[00:49:04] the impression that's your title and that's your description having very keyword specific things
[00:49:10] in those is very important next is getting people to click on your click through rate that's
[00:49:16] your thumbnail having some kind of compelling thumbnail helps to click through rate and then the
[00:49:22] next one is your average view duration how engaging was your actual content you can always change
[00:49:27] your your thumbnail you can always change your title you can't change your content but those are
[00:49:31] the three games that you kind of have to like get involved in you don't have to be the master at
[00:49:37] them but you have to play them well I think we've made a pretty strong case that YouTube could be
[00:49:43] a wonderful refer or lead source for agents and look we're always I love Brian I love
[00:49:51] this Brian Tracy webinar that or seminar that I heard many many years ago he said a great saying
[00:49:57] that's always stuck with me is sales solve all problems another words basically leads solve all
[00:50:04] problems and so this idea of if you're listening right now and you are needing more leads and I'd
[00:50:09] say that's just about all of us but certainly it is for me and in what I do recruiting agents we
[00:50:14] have 46,000 agents I have access to all of their information yet I still need leads because I need
[00:50:20] people that are going oh I want to check out what you're doing if I just called call 46,000 agents 99
[00:50:25] percent of them are like get lost and I'm happy where I'm at so this idea of getting leads is really
[00:50:30] really important and you you know you talked about hey now we now you actually have some additional
[00:50:35] marketing strategies but for the last three years were you just doing YouTube was that your primary
[00:50:39] or only method of really generating business 100 percent yeah all in on that
[00:50:46] unbelievable that is an incredible credible thing one last question music I just wanted to ask
[00:50:52] and I know you're at your I don't know if your editor deals with music or if you do are you putting
[00:50:56] music in and and where are you where are you getting them music always so we have I have a subscription
[00:51:01] to epidemic sound and it it helps it learns kind of the things you like and that's what I
[00:51:06] recommended people like actually just choose the music you like yeah put it in there because it
[00:51:11] is going to become a little bit more of a personal brand as you go my editor just has the login
[00:51:15] she picks it I don't even think about it when I review the video I'm like yeah it's fine
[00:51:22] yeah ultimately you got to have it but it's really about the content and people they don't
[00:51:26] remember the music anyway right they just remember no and mine's mostly like for this little catchy
[00:51:30] intro we do with like some cool footage of the area and the logo and stuff like that yeah I love
[00:51:35] that well let's talk about re-youtuber.com and the course that you offer and because I'm sure we've
[00:51:41] got a lot of people out there that are love to learn to get how to get 45 leads a 45 closed sales
[00:51:47] in a year all from YouTube so tell us about the course yeah so the course was just the culmination
[00:51:52] of the the practice that I was taking to build this thing I did this three years before I even
[00:51:56] thought about building a course and then I was like well what if I could just put everything together
[00:52:00] started writing this outline started I started shooting it the same day my house flooded a year ago
[00:52:07] it was on my calendar my time I'm gonna go ahead and start it like let's just see what happens
[00:52:12] it I've I'm really proud of how it turned out it's really concise there's not there's no fluff in it
[00:52:18] some of the videos there's 80 some videos in there some are only two minutes long
[00:52:22] because it's like hey this is where this thing is go here and do it do it like this
[00:52:27] but it's it's a culmination of everything I've learned how I tell stories exactly how to play in
[00:52:32] your videos one of the sections if if somebody reaches out I can give you a 10 day trial and the last
[00:52:38] section in it is like a shoot with Sam section where I actually pick the topic right out the outline
[00:52:43] go find the place to shoot it you see me actually like sitting down at a park bench recording the video
[00:52:49] everybody this watch that section their their feedback is like wow I'm really overthinking this
[00:52:55] I love that so I love that the shoot so you get to almost see like behind the scenes kind of stuff
[00:53:00] 100% then I edit the video then I you know make the thumbnail you get to see all of it
[00:53:06] so do you have somebody that travels with you to to shoot some of this some of the behind the scenes footage
[00:53:11] or not at all that day I had my partner with me so I could like do it in the car and as we're going
[00:53:15] but I do it all myself amazing you know it takes me about three hours a week
[00:53:22] to make one video yeah that's absolutely reasonable that's including uploading thumbnails everything
[00:53:29] and if so we say let's just say it's three hours a week and let's say it takes you and I'm just
[00:53:35] making these numbers up but let's say it takes two videos to get one lead or maybe three videos
[00:53:40] even let's just say it takes three videos before you get one lead you know that's nine hours of work
[00:53:45] for thousands and thousands of dollars in commission I would do that all day long
[00:53:52] yeah we've we've closed about half as many deals as we publish videos
[00:53:58] that's incredible so we've published about 300 videos we've closed around 150 deals
[00:54:03] so one out of every two video essentially speaking what you're getting one close sale on every
[00:54:08] two videos yeah that's a pretty good return on investment considering 150 bucks to the editor
[00:54:15] maybe you know the subscription to the music things you know something and maybe a few other
[00:54:19] little tools that you use obviously your equipment all of that but that's you buy it once whatever
[00:54:24] pretty good return on investment there one of the tools people already have also there's free
[00:54:29] music you get there's like there's so many other ways if you want to do it you'll find the way
[00:54:34] I wonder to what person you won't probably know this but I'm gonna make a guess and you can tell
[00:54:39] me if I'm off what percentage of people that reach out to you do not become your client
[00:54:44] they're like hey I want to talk to you I'll bet you it's less than 10 percent oh wait less than
[00:54:49] 10 percent yeah yeah yeah because I can tell I can tell right after that they're like I'm talking to
[00:54:53] other REALTORS I'm like okay you're probably gonna choose them right because I'm not gonna like
[00:54:57] sell you right yeah I mean look you've only been there three four years somebody comes in and like
[00:55:02] hey I've been here 25 years I know everything yeah maybe you lose to that person just because
[00:55:06] experience yeah but it doesn't matter because 90 something percent of everyone who reaches out to
[00:55:12] you is converting that is I need to hire you to help me with my recruiting I think I lost a
[00:55:17] buyer like that they were I showed them around for a day like four or five million dollar houses
[00:55:22] and they're like we're gonna go with this other guy they told me on a zoom call really like
[00:55:25] sweet about it like we want to pay you for your time I had about 10 hours of work setting everything
[00:55:31] up driving them all around they sent me five thousand dollars wow they're just thankful for me
[00:55:38] and the help the thing the value I did provide so it's basically a deal right in a way yeah I
[00:55:44] didn't have to actually close a deal but you but you did a lot you did work and you were compensated
[00:55:48] for it I think that's right all right so everyone I want everyone to go to RE real estate RE YouTuber
[00:55:54] RE YouTuber.com link in our our show notes also really check out Sam's client facing website because
[00:56:02] people don't only search on YouTube they're also of course searching on Google and everywhere else
[00:56:06] so Sam has a not just a great YouTube channel he has a great website and notice when you look at
[00:56:11] his website think about who is this for why did he put it in the way that he did and if you were
[00:56:18] somebody that was interested in moving to Tampa what would you think about that website would that
[00:56:23] appeal to you take off your REALTOR hat put on your buyer hat or or maybe a seller hat and go to
[00:56:28] that website and you will see that that is how he really structured it's not hey I'm Sam I'm the
[00:56:36] Sam doesn't really do that what he does instead is says here's the content you need and you're
[00:56:40] gonna choose me because you're gonna fall in love with my content right and that's what's unsaid
[00:56:44] and that's exactly what has happened so you don't have to be the best pitch person you literally
[00:56:50] just have to be able to give content that people want and make it in a package that is you know
[00:56:56] somewhat presentable so RE YouTuber.com is where you can learn Sam mentioned this you might have
[00:57:02] missed it 10 free days he's gonna give you so to test it out so please do it I promise you
[00:57:08] this will help your business. Yeah to get the 10 free days you have to send me a DM on Instagram
[00:57:11] at the Sam Coddle be down there in the description. At Sam Coddle that's C-A-U-D-L-E I will put a link
[00:57:19] to that in the show notes you have to DM him and ask for the 10 free days and he will he will
[00:57:25] hook you up so go to Instagram at Sam Coddle and say I'd like to and let him know you you found out
[00:57:30] about it on our podcast keeping it real that way. Absolutely. We would appreciate that. All right Sam
[00:57:34] this has been amazing I could talk to you all day as a marketer myself but this is a perfect time
[00:57:40] to wrap for this we're gonna have you back in the future of course as well. Yeah because the
[00:57:46] cool thing part about online media consumption it's always changing so you know you might be doing
[00:57:51] totally different things in five years because the public may have moved away from YouTube or maybe
[00:57:56] and probably not but they may be also engaged with a different platform so you're gonna continue to
[00:58:01] evolve and go to where the customers are and I'm super excited to continue to watch that process
[00:58:06] for you because you're only three years in and you're crushing it and it's and you're not a
[00:58:11] salesy person you're not a you know you're not you're not doing a lot of the things that maybe the
[00:58:15] other agents in your area are doing that being said I want everybody are you tober.com check it out
[00:58:22] go to Instagram at Sam Coddle link in the in the show notes send him a DM ask for the 10 free days

And now on to our show. Today's episode is brought to you by Corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team? Now as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I go powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2,000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded.io looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but Corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now if you are looking to grow your brokerage, Corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit Corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's Corded.io. And now onto the show. Hello and welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris.

All right, guys, you're the best. Let's get to the main event. My conversation with Sam Coddle. Okay, today on the show, we have Sam Coddle with Living in Tampa, brokered by eXp in Tampa, Florida. Let me tell you a little bit more about Sam. Now in 2020, Sam moved his family across the country to Florida where he got his real estate license and jumped in the deep end. He quickly discovered that making searchable videos on YouTube would be his ideal way to find clients. Now Sam has three children and a thriving real estate business that is positioned to grow even more. Sam is now excited to help other agents achieve the exact same success that he has through YouTube and he's created a course. And that course is the website for that course is RE YouTuber.com RE for real estate YouTube with an R at the end, YouTuber.com will have a link to that in the show notes, RE YouTuber.com. And also I really encourage everyone watching to check out Sam's client facing website, which is living in Tampa FL.com. And as you guessed it, it's all about if you're moving and living in Tampa, what you need to know. So living in Tampa FL.com link to that as well in the show notes, along with Sam's social channels and his YouTube channel. So we want you to subscribe to all of his stuff. Sam, welcome to the show. Thanks DJ. Super excited to be here. Super excited to talk to I think you're the very first person we've ever had on. Boy, I hope I'm not wrong from Tampa. And I should remember because I go down there a lot. I was telling Sam beforehand, my sister lives there. And so I have a lot of a lot of Tampa time, but I think you might be the very first Tampa agent, although my brother in law is also an eXp agent funny enough. I just remembered that he's on the commercial side. And he is not he does not get the invite to be on the show as much as I love him. Only because he does commercial. And I don't think our listeners care that much about commercial, but technically I do know one other broker in Tampa, which is my brother in law who I is great. But Sam, yeah, excited to chat about you. My my first question is because you know, this is still a relatively new new wish career for you. And you have built a lot of content in that, you know, four years will say, right? And again, if everyone watching or if you're driving obviously don't do this, but if you're if you're alone and you could do this, go to living in Tampa fl.com and just kind of take a look at the content that Sam posts his YouTube channels there. And you can also see some of the thumbnails and you'll get a good idea of what he's doing. And and Sam is certainly not the first agent in the country to sort of apply the strategy. However, 99 probably 0.9% of agents don't do any of this. So even though it's it's not maybe a brand new strategy in 2024, it is still a super effective and relevant strategy. And probably in whatever local market you you're in, that probably nobody is doing this. So this is a great thing to learn. So we're super. And by the way, Sam can teach you how to do this as well, are you tuber.com. But Sam, let's let's start at the beginning sort of what, you know, what got you into real estate? Yes. So I the 10 years prior to getting into real estate, I worked for a big nonprofit in Colorado and did anything you can imagine for them. But I kind of became known as the guy that wants to build something build something new scale it and then move on. I wasn't really the manager type, more of a builder. So I got a lot of opportunity because of that. I was also the one that would ask like, I remember my second year I was there. Can I like, can I come to the board meeting? And they're like, no, but I just wanted the exposure. I'm like, I want to go in the deep end to see what it's like. And I've just always been that kind of person that asked for opportunities. I started helping them acquire some real estate and realized, I think I want to do real estate next. And just kind of always knew that was next, then during the pandemic, all kinds of transitions were happening with all kinds of employers. And had a chance to just make them move. And we took the jump. Wow. How do you how do you enjoy Florida? I know Florida is such a, you know, such an interesting place because of course, right now, it's probably not the best time to be right now, by the way, where it's August 6th with the time of recording this. So probably not the easiest time to be in Tampa because of, of course, the weather and it's tough, but the rest of the year, amazing summertime can be tricky. But are you getting used to the humidity and the heat or not quite yet? Yeah, I'm pretty used to it. I like it. You just, you adapt to sweating. I just have extra clothes in my truck all the time. I just know I'm, if I do three clients in a row, I'm going to have to change clothes. Least shirt because I'm starting to have some fumes. Well, we were in Chicago. And yesterday, the humidity was almost 90% and even though it wasn't super warm, I was like 78 degrees, which it felt like 90 degrees. And I was sweating within minutes of just walking around. So I, I get that every time I go to Florida, I'm, I asked my sister once, I go, when did you get used to the humidity? And she's like, you never get used to it. You just learn how to cope with it. Yeah, you just stopped complaining about it. Because also last year, I think was kind of like my initiation year to Florida. I had a car accident and I had a house flood. Oh, so I think I'm passed that stuff now. Hopefully, I still own that house. I have renters in there. And the water yesterday was five feet from the front porch. Oh, my goodness. Yeah. Wow. Well, my sister, yeah, my sister's okay. We checked in. There was obviously the big storm. So yeah, glad that, glad that it didn't come in. And there's, there aren't basements and there aren't a lot of basements in Florida. So what it comes in, it comes in and it does. Yeah. Well, sorry, you had to deal with that. That's okay. Yeah. Last year. Well, I made, I made content about it. Of course, you know, what? Thank you for mentioning that. And let's talk, let's, let's dive into that. So when I see content from REALTORS and when I see most video content, the majority of the video content I see is on social media. So we're talking about reels, stories. And you know, we're talking Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, even maybe LinkedIn and YouTube, maybe some shorts, things like that. But most, most agents really aren't utilizing much of YouTube. Maybe they upload a video once in a while, but there isn't really a strategy there. Right. They tend to have strategies around short form video on social media. But what I love is that, you know, you took this awful thing about, you know, getting, you know, having your house flood and realizing that, oh, this happens to other people too. Maybe it's a good idea to share sort of my experience. So can you talk about your, talk about your business? Because you do things a lot differently. I mean, as a REALTOR, obviously, you do things similarly. And that way, but in your marketing, it's really very different. Yeah. My business coach has this analogy. I really like, he says Marilyn Manson and Taylor Swift are very similar. They couldn't be more different, but they do all the same things. They, they write songs, they record songs, they promote them, they sell tickets. Like it's all kind of the same stuff, even though the packaging is very different. My business is YouTube. That's mostly what I do in the business at this, at this point is make YouTube videos and build out processes for our clients to come through. But it's videos that are, are being searched for already. And that's the biggest difference with something you're saying about other platforms. People are going on to YouTube, not just your grandparents, but you, every listener is searched for something to learn on YouTube. It's the, it's the second biggest search engine behind Google. And, and so we, we don't think of social media as much that way. Obviously, you can search on Instagram and, and TikTok, I guess, but you're really just passive most, most of the time, you're probably just passively getting whatever they send to you. Whereas on YouTube, yes, you can get that passive stuff too, but that search engine is, is so it's, it's bigger than YouTube search, or sorry, bigger than Yahoo, bigger than Bing. It's literally huge. And that was the approach from the beginning. Hey, I'm going to play this, figure out this game and play this game, not tell anybody I'm doing it, not send this link to anybody. And I published my first video the next day, it had 23 views. And I was like, wow, 23 strangers found my video. I did it. Like, that's what it felt like, that dopamine hit of those first views. I'm like, I'm publishing three videos a week now. Like, I'm going fast. I didn't have any clients yet. I wasn't busy. Like, let's go for it. And then it's very topical things. It's like, somebody's moving across the country. What are they going to search for? What is it cost to live there? Where are the best schools? Then they're going to get more and more narrow as they go. Best suburbs around Tampa. Best neighborhoods in Wesley Chapel. Like, they're going to get more and more narrow, but it starts to really broad. The top of the funnel starts to really broad and it gets more and more narrow. And you can get as niche as you'd like because anyone moving into any neighborhood might be searching for maybe best restaurants in XYZ neighborhood, or it could even be sort of non or real estate adjacent kind of stuff. It might just be useful information like you said schools could be retailers, could be restaurants, could be parks, it could be really anything. Because I know like when I moved into my most current condo and it was in a new neighborhood that I hadn't a neighborhood that was new to me, I didn't even know where the closest park was. And one day I'm like, I was just about to close on. I got to curious where the closest park is. And I googled it and I actually went to YouTube and I said, where are I actually did it on YouTube because I wanted to see what the parks looks like. So somebody had made a video said here are the parks in Wicker Park. And so I this is such a great, great idea because of course people search, I know when I go on vacation, my dad and I went on a trip to Ireland several years ago and what we did, we traveled all over the country. And the night before we would the night before the next day for our itinerary that following day, we went on YouTube. We said, what are the most interesting things to do in XYZ City. And that's how we knew what to do. And so what you're talking about is exactly sort of what we did on vacation. And when I moved into my condo here in Chicago, I was like, okay, show me the cool restaurants, where the parks, things like that. So I love this. Yeah. And then answering the specific questions that you know your clients already ask, is there a trader Joe's nearby? How far is it from the airport? How far is it from the beach? How far is it from downtown? Like actually just answering the question, showing the map, traffic's going to be bad at this time. Be careful. Like those that like hyper local kind of data, people really, really want and really search for. Oh, I have an idea for you if you haven't already done this. Because I don't know if this is an off Florida. I know it's in Tampa. Some of the intersections have six minute lights. And I know that's a big thing in Tampa. And it's it's weird if you're not used to it. Nobody's told you you're like, there's something wrong with these lights. So like that could be a video is like get ready for six minute lights at some intersection. Well, and if you live in that specific zip code, your car insurance is going to be double everybody else's too. Is it right? That's why those lights are so long is because it slows down traffic so much more. Right. Yeah. That's fascinating. Those little quirks. Yeah. But but again, like I remember when somebody said to me, I go, Dana, what's my sister? Like, why are the lights so long? She's like, that's a traffic thing. And I go, yeah, but that's a really unique solution. I'm like, I got to look that up. And I never did. I don't think it's the right solution. Well, certainly not fun to sit in. But it is something people who are moving to Tampa should probably know. So, you know, what's so cool about what you're doing is the content is kind of it's somewhat unlimited in sense because anytime a client who is moving to Tampa that you're working with, you know, you can just catalog all the questions they ask you and those can all be videos. Right. Or it's one video where I'm telling a story of them, Hey, these person, this family came and they needed these three things. If you're like them, give me a call and let's get into these things. Like, the call to action is even just built into there. And that call to action is where a lot of people miss in their content in general. Like, no, tell them to call you, tell them you want them to call and you're going to answer. And you have an awesome process and you want to help more clients like all that. I love that. Let's talk about the production of videos because I think we've made a pretty simple and strong case that people search for for specific questions on YouTube and you can make content around that. But a lot of people are going to a lot of our listeners are going to feel a little intimidated. You know, with gosh, I don't I'm not a post production person. I don't have a camera crew. I don't know how to edit, right? So curious about sort of what that learning curve was. If you're doing it, if you're if you're having other people do it and sort of what you're any suggestions you have for people that are starting this process. Sure. I started it with my phone. There was not much of a learning curve for me there, though, because I had had some experience with video production, had traveled into some other countries and shot some documentaries. So that that part wasn't intimidating to me. It is for a lot of people. But starting with your phone, adjusting your settings to kind of be optimized for that, which I'd love to show anybody exactly what to do for that. And doing it like that is it's very approachable. People are not in like upset that you're using a phone. Right. You can make it look great, especially if you're outside in a recognizable Tampa looking place or wherever your city is. Like your phone can do a great job. When it comes to editing, somebody asked me recently, hey, I'm looking at hiring an editor, but I want to edit my videos for a while. So I know if I'm hiring a good editor. I'm like, first of all, don't do that. Just hire an editor. Because if your aunt came to you and said, hey, I want to sell my house, but I want to get my license and I want to sell a few houses first before I choose a listing agent, you would say, no, don't do that. It's the same kind of thing. I love that. That's that's really, really smart. So this idea, it also too, I was listening to Mr. Beast. If you don't, if for our listeners, anyone who doesn't know, Mr. Beast is the number one you two, right? I think he's number one as far as most most a list do he puts out a video and gets like 90 million views within a few days. It's incredible. And he, I was reading a book that his his coach wrote about sort of talked a lot about his process. And he said, Mr. Beast does a little blurb in the book. And he's like, your first hundred videos are going to be garbage. And he's like, you just don't worry about it. It's just, it's just what's going to happen. Go ahead and push him out anyway, because you're going to get better. And every single video, you're going to get just a little bit better. And once you get above a hundred videos, which sounds like a lot, maybe it won't take a hundred, but whatever that number is, like the first hundred episodes I did of this show were probably garbage. So, so I can, I can understand that process, but not having the expectation, like you were saying that it has to be perfect. You know, people really just care about content more than they care about production, right? And YouTube above other platforms is very forgiving. They're people are subscribing and along for the journey to see you grow. Now, you're going to have what I look back at my first videos and they still get views. So I'm not going to take them down. But what I was saying was so like basic, simple and surface. Now when I tell a story, it's a little more dynamic. It has some layers to it. Like I have more clients to tell stories about. Like it evolves and people aren't there for it. Yeah. And so your first video got 23 views the first night, which, which is again, amazing that somehow people found that you weren't promoting it. And then sort of how did it, how did it grow from there? And again, I want to make, make a point before we do this is that I've had over the years, I've had a few other people who do have a similar process to Sam. And by the way, Sam will teach you exactly how to do this. REYouTuber.com is where you go to learn. Sam has a course. It's amazing. He's going to show you exactly everything he knows. And when I've had a few other people who have done this over the years, I don't think I've had anybody who does it this year. So I'm glad to have Sam on today. And one of the things that they have mentioned is that these videos, one thing that how they're different from social media. And of course, this just may not occur to our listeners. Of course, Sam knows it is the content lives forever. He talked about it. My first videos are still up there. Why? Because they still get views. They still are relevant for people who are searching. Now, social media stuff is pretty digestible and then forgotten. It's disposable for the most part. It's really hard to have anything, you know, really take hold on social media. But I want to say that, you know, when you look at Sam's videos, he's getting lots of views. But he's not getting Mr. Beast numbers. And he doesn't need to. He totally doesn't need to. If you even get a thousand views, and I know usually your videos do way more than a thousand, but even if you got a thousand, I'm curious, do you happen to have an idea of how many views for you it takes on average to like get a lead? Now, I don't know if you have that number in mind, but I'm just not a curiosity. It's probably not a super high number of views. No, it's probably a hundred is it's actually that's amazing. Lower than people think. And I think there's actually a problem whenever your video becomes too big, a video that has 50,000 views, you seem unreachable. You seem less local like all those kind of things that you do want to feel. Yeah, there's really a sweet spot. I think about 5,000 subscribers and about 1200 views of video is like a sweet spot to be in. You're still a regular guy that's doing well, I guess is maybe the way that people see it is like, Oh, I could I could probably talk like I can't get Mr. Beast on the phone. He's not going to take my call, but I might be able to get Sam and the reality of it is Sam, once my business, anyway, right? That's yeah, the money is of course in the transaction. Do you speaking of money when you're talking about cost of producing these videos? Do you spend a lot of money to make them or are they relatively inexpensive? I said hire an editor hire an editor somewhere else. My editor is in India and she's growing in agency. I refer people to her all the time. She's great. She sent me a cold email. I was already doing it editing it myself and I pay her $150 a video. She's good on style, good on timelines. Like we keep it rolling. That seems very reasonable for a video. My lender pays for it too. Even better. Sam just said something really, really important is of course you can have strategic partnerships with other providers and this is where you hit up your lender especially and maybe a title company or maybe a whatever and you say, hey, maybe I can and I don't know if you have a way that you promote their services on those videos or however the situation is or you just give them your business, but you can work out an arrangement so that they cover that cost or some of the cost at least. Right. Yeah, who else could gain from a buyer? Typically a lender who else could gain from a seller? Typically a title company. So there's great ways to leverage those relationships. And lenders and title companies have deep, deep pockets for anyone who doesn't already know that title companies are the forgotten sort of partner. So definitely reach out to them. You can also do a state planning attorneys. There's divorce attorneys. There's financial advisors. There's insurance agents. A million different sort of adjunct kind of professions that feed into what we do in real estate. So I love that. And then once you build enough of a brand and enough reputation, like we have a new title company we're partnering with and they're like, here's your budget. We're like, what kind of reporting do you guys want? They're like, we trust you guys. Like, let's try something. Okay. Love it. Yeah. Well, yeah, don't know if you're if they're getting business from you or not. Yeah, they're like, let's try for six months. I'm like, okay, great. And title companies make ends. I don't know what it it might probably change from state to state, but here in Illinois, maybe thousands and thousands of dollars on even just one transaction. Yeah. Again, that may not be the same in every market, but it is big, big money here. And that's where you know, you can hit them up. So I love that. So you let me go back to something you said about the content being evergreen because I like this analogy I've been I've been working on. You go into the library and it's full of books that stay there. They were they're they're useful to people all the time at the entry to the library. There's something else. It's a newspaper stand. Those change every day. Yeah. They're topical. They're based. They're trying to be catchy. You know, if it bleeds, it reads, right. That's that's the clicky social media right there in the front. I'm trying to build the library. I don't care about the the newspaper. You don't want to put a new newspaper every day on one of those big wooden sticks. No, of course not. And that's that's a really great point because you know, people people also go to the library or YouTube to learn about how to fix their dishwasher. How to that I've got, you know, my girlfriend had a leak in her dish or her dishwasher was leaking and she goes, you know, I probably should figure out what's going on. And I said, just go to YouTube. There's, you know, put it put in your like type of dishwasher you have and just say common issues or leaks or whatever. She figured it she she found a video within a minute. And then of course it's all the problem. Yeah. And that video will live forever. And that video probably had 120 views or something. But everybody that watched it found some value in it. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. I love that. So you do three videos a week. Let's talk about shooting the videos. So you you you you do you still use your phone or do you have different equipment at this point? I'm way in like overkill. I'm not kind of so. Um, I would make certain recommendations like I would recommend either either either sticking with a phone and adding a microphone or upgrading to like the DJI Osmo pocket three. That's like a gimbal. Correct. Yeah. A little gimbal camera. And the creator combo comes with a microphone. It's like you could do everything with that. You don't even need a drone. Like you people prefer drive by footage over drone footage anyway. Yeah. Yeah. Drone footage is is yeah. It can be very cool if done perfectly. But yeah, I think that I I brought to prefer to see drive by it and in your your stats also verify that the drive by stuff. So what a gimbal is everyone is just basically a a a pivoting system that you can hold that keeps your camera or your phone stable. So you can move around and it's not jiggling around or or making people sick to their stomach. So it's reasonably inexpensive. The one you're talking about like maybe it's 150 bucks at most is probably less than that. But it's great because you just basically can hold it and it'll keep it stabilized for you. Yeah, that's the one that you would use your phone with. If you get the one with the built in camera and the creator combo, I think it's around 800. But you know, yeah, because you would never need anything else. Gotcha. Like you'd be set with that. But so I don't do three videos a week anymore. I started with that. Then I went down to two a week and I did that for three years. Now I do one a week and I do more comprehensive videos longer longer form video. Correct. So they're they're typically I mean, they're always over eight minutes, but they're typically over 15 minutes. Wow. So let's let's talk about length because video length because there's lots of misconceptions about, you know, how long a video should be. It should be under two minutes or it should be longer. And the real what's been your experience because you have to look at the metrics. You have to look at when people are, you know, when are they signing off the video, when are they leaving the video? Are they leaving it at two minutes? Obviously not if you're making these longer form videos. Should people be concerned as long as content is really strong, should they be concerned about how going too long? I know they should not be concerned about going too long. They should be concerned about is the content actually good good enough to be this long. And that's that's a real question. That's where you keep people engaged. So my average the view duration percentage is around 45%. So most of the audience drops off by then. And 40 and people want that to be over 40%. Got it. Yeah. So that's the sweet spot is you want to get it. And let's I want to talk about the pitch real quick because you talked about asking for the business. But if most of the people are dropping off midpoint, are you putting the pitch in along the way or you saving it to the end or just yeah, because you do you do say there's a call to action. Where do you sort of insert that beginning, middle and end everywhere? Yeah. And people people take it too seriously. So I break it down into three elements. Number one, ask for ask for them to call like tell them who you are have some kind of value proposition. I always say this is the living in I'm saying with the living in Tampa channel, we make these videos for you about what it's like to live and move to Tampa. We're also a team of REALTORS and we want you to call us. So call text or email anytime. It's actually us that answers. And then the final part of this is I say what will happen next after you reach out. We'll schedule zoom call or phone call and just process your situation and see how we can best help. Once I started adding that last part, people would start texting and saying, send me the link to set up a zoom call with Sam. Yeah, let's so Sam did something very elegant and could be easy to miss is he presupposed in his statement that they were going to take that next step. He said, Hey, when you do this, here's what's going to happen next. He didn't say if you do this, he said when you do this, because that presupposition there is that they're going to do it. So that had a that had an impact. And then at the end, I say, if you got value out of this, if you made it to the end of this video, I want to hear from you whether you're going to buy yourself right now or two years from now, give us a call. Yeah, because if they watch all the way through, they must have liked it. And they now they go, Hey, this guy knows at least a little bit. I stayed 15 minutes on a video. You're not going to do that if you don't appreciate the content. And now, yeah, you want to hit them at the end. And also, I do that too at the end of our show because we get a drop off percentage as well, like like any podcast. And I always say to the end, if you made it to the end, like, like we love you, please tell everybody about us. Yeah. Which is our call to action. But in fact, in fact, I'll say it now, please tell everyone about us. Okay, that's the end of my page. But tell everyone about Sam too. If you know other agents that I'm telling you guys, this is the, I truly believe, I'll give you a personal example. So I'm a recruiter for for REALTORS. The biggest mistake I've made over the 14 years I've been recruiting agents. And we have almost 800 agents. And I'm very proud of that. But we should have like 2000 agents by now. And the reason why we don't, maybe it's because I'm not a very good recruiter. But it could also be because, and I believe this to be true is I don't have a lot of video content for what REALTORS are looking for specifically around maybe choosing a brokerage or maybe learning what different brokerages offer or maybe just tips. Here's a good REALTOR tip of the day. Or here is, you know, whatever, I don't have a lot of that content. So people have to seek me out, which is not the always the easiest thing because there's hundreds of real estate firms here in Chicago. There's 46,000 REALTORS in the area. So one of the things my big initiative is basically to do exactly what Sam is talking about, which is to create longer form content on YouTube, specifically answering questions, REALTORS. We call them brokers here in Illinois. So if I said brokers, I want to just make sure to us, that's a REALTOR in Illinois. So I know it's not that way in every state, but I want to answer that the questions REALTORS have. And guess what? Nobody's making that content here locally. And so if you're if you're looking to increase the number of teammates that you have, if you're on a team, this is a way, it could be a way to do it as well. But I get really excited about this because I think it's just such an untapped, there's so much untapped potential. And I'm also curious to if you ever take your videos, your long form YouTube videos, and then chop them up into short form bites that you could then send out on Instagram, Facebook, TikTok, these sort of more short form magic moments of the 15 minute video. No, I don't. I'm I'm playing one game with those videos and I don't want to pretend like it's repackaged. It's it's as valuable. Also, the people that follow me personally on Instagram are friends and family and REALTORS. They're not people that are trying to move to Tampa, typically that are following me there. So I want to engage with that audience a little bit differently. That that makes a lot of sense. So Sam just I want to just reiterate what Sam said because he said something very, very important. He goes, you know, hey, my social media people who follow me, they're really people who already know me. And there's nothing wrong with showing them some of my content, but it's really not for them. It's for the people that don't yet know me and YouTube's going to be the place where they're going to most easily find that. So I'm going to focus all my energy and in one channel and also too. So sticking to YouTube probably helps you focus a lot better. Like I know we push this podcast out to all the major channels and it makes sense to do that because it's not really difficult for us to do that. But if you were to say, hey, DJ, how often are you on TikTok answering fan requests? I'm like never. So so that's probably not good because somebody writes a comment on one of my videos and I don't even respond, right? So so it does make sense to hyper focus in one area. I would say go where your customers are for Sam's customers. They're going to YouTube for learning about Tampa. I want to go back in one other thing up to you asked about kind of the production process. A lot of people get behind in this because they don't have videos ready. I have like videos in different stages all the time, you know, from random ideas I've jotted down to like I started to like write a bit of the outline to the outlines ready to go to it's like shot already. So having ideas in the pipeline that are ready to go to where I go to shoot if I'm you know running early for an appointment. I'm in this suburb. Let's set up the camera real quick. Let's shoot this video. Oh, I could shoot a broader video about suburbs to while I'm here. And if those are ready, then I'm just like looking at the outline and going for it. Are you writing like each word of your script or is it just a general outline and then you sort of just you know instinctively know what to say. Yeah, it's very very rough. Sometimes I'll write down five words. I've never written a script. I've never read from a teleprompter. I want this to feel very unscripted. I want to have the moments where I'm like looking off and like thinking of what I was going to say and I want all that I want all that to happen on camera because all that also lets people get to know you. And they know that you're a real person and you're not reading from a script. And we all know that when it's very hard to read from a teleprompter and sound natural just is it is difficult. So really you've got a rough you've got questions you want to those are going to be the titles of your videos. These are the answers to the questions that people are asking you have a rough outline of like okay, there's like three or four ideas I want to maybe tackle within this video. And then you just talk. And then the editing process. Now I know you have a woman helping you overseas. Are you doing a lot of quick edits? I know that's a real common popular style. Are you doing more longer form edits where you just kind of go and go and you're not cutting every few seconds? It depends in the beginning it was like it was getting cut every few seconds because I was saying um or pausing or things like that trying to think of what I was going to say. It's a lot more fluid now where you know there's a cut every 30 seconds kind of a thing because you want to let that story kind of come out naturally. And my editor kind of understands the style and and we use we use like frame IO to review those videos and you can leave comments on very specific time codes. And I you know explain all of that in detail that takes time with an editor. People are get one one video done and they're like my editor didn't do it the way I want like well you probably didn't give them enough instructions but also tell them how to do the next one. Go ahead and publish that one. Tell them how you want to do the next one. Yeah. Have you ever been surprised at the number of leads that have come in from a video that you thought? I don't know if anyone's really going to pay too much attention to this. I guess the reason I'm asking this is we have these ideas that we think are the idea. We're like okay I got it this is going to be the one that gets me all my leads. I can't wait to do it and then we can get very disappointed. Like I've done that on the show. I used to have Zillow come on every every every month as a corporate Zillow and I sort of I like Zillow so I'm not a Zillow is the worst evil company ever but there are a lot of agents that don't like Zillow and I was like this is good oh I also had Facebook coming on every month to talk about what they offer to REALTORS like literally you know Menlo Park Facebook was on my show. I was like this is going to this is going to skyrocket my success. I got Facebook. I got Zillow. Yeah people didn't really care. They only really cared when I talked to people like you and said how do you do this and I was like oh okay well so as that ever happened where you put a video together and it either exceeds your expectations or just just does it. Yeah definitely and I want to answer Jake's question in the the YouTube comments. The topic we're talking about is YouTube for real estate and the video that really surprised me with the feedback was I I moved to a bigger house on an acre and I'm like I want more clients that want to buy a house like this because it's kind of fun to shop for and so I was like what it's like to live on an acre around Tampa. I love it and people I mean we've got we've closed five deals from that video. Wow in the past three months and people are like I saw that video about living on an acre around Tampa. I didn't even know that was possible and they're moving from St. Petersburg. They just want more space. It's like okay great. I love that and so with Tampa what people who maybe aren't familiar with Tampa areas you have St. Peter St. Petersburg nearby. You have clear water nearby. There's there's a bunch of really desirable kind of fun areas that are adjacent to Tampa. Are you branching out into those areas as well because I guess you would have to assume that you're willing to drive there to do deals or maybe find a partner that you could work within those areas but are you trying to keep it really narrow so that you're not driving even three kids you're busy. What's sort of the thought process with where you're doing these? Yeah so pretty early in the business I found a partner that didn't have kids and that had ambition so that he could drive to those places and it's been a great growth journey through that but we work about a 40 mile radius all around like when people are moving here from across the country Tampa is this big. Yeah to people to your sister that lives in South Tampa Tampa is this big. I only know South Tampa. I don't know anything outside of South Tampa. I go to South Tampa like maybe four times a year. Not every like so I realize like locals really view these areas so small. Yeah and I being an outsider I can tell that story from an outsider perspective. Yeah. The locals talk about it like this but it's actually like this like that is something I really tapped into in my videos like let me be you because I was you four years ago I moved here from across the country and all these things surprised me. Are you as far as just metrics as far as people want to know how many leads and I don't you don't have to share with us you know all of all of you know your metrics but are we talking about you know are leads being generated on every week every month you know sort of how do you think about you know tracking the success of the video. Yeah I don't track it per video I just look at the year look at the volume but let's talk about the actual numbers so I started January 2021 first video that year that April I closed the first first deal from YouTube and I closed 13 deals from YouTube that year. It's amazing. The next year we closed 25 deals from YouTube so it's 2022 2023 we closed 44 deals from YouTube and this year we've closed about 35 so far and you have a lot about almost half the year left so that is right you are definitely exceeding and we have other lead sources now in the business we're doing some cold outbound stuff we have a little bit more reputation the leverage to get listings and it's it just keeps growing but also that space people don't just call about a $300,000 house they call about a $3 million house too. Really? that's amazing and did you make a specific sort of intention to start trying to relate to those higher net worth individuals. I did and I had a few reach out and I was like how do I find more people like you I wear T-shirt and the best question you could ever ask a client that you want to duplicate. Yeah I need I need to find more people like you if you were me how might you do that. I'm like I like you you like me how do I find more people like you people love that question. It's great it's like the most flattering thing you could say to somebody. Yeah he's like you know I liked that you were chill that you were wearing a video wearing a t-shirt in your videos that you're obviously doing it yourself you're hustling and he this one guy he was like I don't know if you'll find a lot more people with my net worth like okay never mind so then I started just talking more about those high high dollar areas not apologizing about them being the what they cost they cost what they cost right you're either one or one or not and it's not up to me to to make some kind of judgment about that it's expensive or cheap or it's whatever yeah and also too like even though you know I made that by at home in a certain price point what I can afford I still like to look at some of these more luxury homes I mean look HGTV has made a lot of money off previewing you know a really expensive home so even though people may not you know be in that particular market maybe they'll share it with somebody they know who is in that price point or who's thinking of moving or hey this is in my neighborhood check out this house or yeah do you I have a question about about getting people reaching out to you maybe outside of the Tampa area even though your videos are really hyper local specific to Tampa does it ever happen or someone's like you know I'm actually I'm in Montana and or somewhere else and they're like you're really great but can you help me find someone or is that ever happened? Yeah usually with an existing client maybe they need to sell where they are we can help them find a listing agent or it was helping a client's daughter yesterday she's buying a house in Ohio helped her find an agent and I'm not so concerned about getting referrals on that I'm concerned about getting raving fans that leave I want I'm now I'm gonna call Lisa later today and say hey can you leave a review saying I also helped your daughter in Ohio when I didn't have to and she'll love to leave that review I love that so so it's also an opportunity to create some some partnerships with agents in feeder areas people I'm sure you probably have a better sense now of where people who move to Tampa might be moving from whether it's you know retirees moving down there whether it's people from I don't know I don't know where people move to from Tampa my sister moved from New York and that was because of a job thing but I don't really know where those feeder markets are so you probably have figured that would it ever make sense to make videos about those feeder markets like yeah yeah yeah yeah so in within the YouTube analytics you can see where your traffic's coming from specific states so even just making comparative videos about those states is really valuable cost of living in New York versus Florida or cost of I mean we have a lot of use from Illinois most are New York though it's Florida and New York as for most of our views are coming from yeah and that makes sense and and now Sam can make videos saying hey thinking of moving from you know from Chicago down to Tampa here's everything you need to know or from New York to Tampa or Atlanta to Tampa whatever he can literally just create the question and do you ever look up before you before you make a video are you also checking to see how many people are searching for that particular phrase prior to making a video a little bit you know in the beginning you rely on those tools a lot after a while like I make very straightforward titles and dumb nails like I'm not playing like a clickbait game right I'm playing like hey this is what this video is about like you either wanted or not and I'm okay with that so I don't play the game as much as I used to but in the beginning it's really important to like look at where is the most volume where's the most search volume and how do I get in front of those people I want to just make this point you did 45 sales in your 30 year yeah that's I sort of even just kind of missed the importance of that as you said it I didn't it didn't hit me and I just realized just how amazing that really truly is we have 800 agents here I know what people do in their 30 year and it's not 45 deals it is rare for somebody to unless they just their network is just insane and they just you know maybe they grew up here whatever you didn't grow up there you moved there and you and theory shouldn't be able to do 45 deals on your 30 year because people should people shouldn't know about you enough and yet they do because of this of this YouTube and you don't have to really I mean yes you have to leave your house to shoot the videos but ultimately these videos run 24 seven who knows I bet you have leads that come in at two in the morning sometimes and yeah yeah it's a interesting yeah last year was an interesting year because I kept hearing every REALTOR struggling you know sales are down transaction counts the lowest it's been I'm like I don't know like my I my doubles I don't know what's happening and I don't say that to brag guys I'm like I'm very thankful that I put in the work to build the the thing when I when I did because it's the work that leaves to the opportunities not like you just identify this opportunity you're like I'm going to get it no you work to have that opportunity to have that luck per se like it's actually just hard work that leads to that and this is a this is a marathon I mean making YouTube videos is certainly yes you can get lucky want maybe and go viral although you know just assume that's never going to happen because it doesn't need to happen it doesn't need to happen to build to build a good business and have people reach out to you I mean look we have tens of thousands of listeners for our show and that's amazing and we need those kind of numbers to be able to continue but like Sam doesn't need tens and I mean probably has tens of thousands of followers but but the reality of it is he just needs like he said 100 views on on a video might get him a lead that's pretty doable if you have great content and then I wanted to ask one last question about search engine optimization specifically to YouTube and that's its own industry how important is it to make sure you have your tags correctly your title correct and any other SEO you know probably things within the video as well that need to sort of be a certain way how important is it to really understand the SEO of YouTube it's important but people tend to think about that a little more than they should yeah they're like I'm going to figure that out I'm going to make sure to 100 out of 100 I I did this test once where I was uploading a video and I'm like I'm not going to do tags now I look back and call this a test it was really just me being like I don't know if tags work I'm not going to do any I got a notification a week later from YouTube saying hey people are really watching this video we're going to push it to a broader audience wow and they give you a kind of a warning because your analytics go down your click through it goes down because they push it to people that aren't searching for it right and but that was the first time I did zero tags so I'm like I yeah I don't think they work well I I tagged tons and tons of videos it doesn't I must be doing it wrong because it doesn't seem to work on YouTube for me although I'm not the expert at all but there are multiple games in YouTube number one is getting it to just show up the impression that's your title and that's your description having very keyword specific things in those is very important next is getting people to click on your click through rate that's your thumbnail having some kind of compelling thumbnail helps to click through rate and then the next one is your average view duration how engaging was your actual content you can always change your your thumbnail you can always change your title you can't change your content but those are the three games that you kind of have to like get involved in you don't have to be the master at them but you have to play them well I think we've made a pretty strong case that YouTube could be a wonderful refer or lead source for agents and look we're always I love Brian I love this Brian Tracy webinar that or seminar that I heard many many years ago he said a great saying that's always stuck with me is sales solve all problems another words basically leads solve all problems and so this idea of if you're listening right now and you are needing more leads and I'd say that's just about all of us but certainly it is for me and in what I do recruiting agents we have 46,000 agents I have access to all of their information yet I still need leads because I need people that are going oh I want to check out what you're doing if I just called call 46,000 agents 99 percent of them are like get lost and I'm happy where I'm at so this idea of getting leads is really really important and you you know you talked about hey now we now you actually have some additional marketing strategies but for the last three years were you just doing YouTube was that your primary or only method of really generating business 100 percent yeah all in on that unbelievable that is an incredible credible thing one last question music I just wanted to ask and I know you're at your I don't know if your editor deals with music or if you do are you putting music in and and where are you where are you getting them music always so we have I have a subscription to epidemic sound and it it helps it learns kind of the things you like and that's what I recommended people like actually just choose the music you like yeah put it in there because it is going to become a little bit more of a personal brand as you go my editor just has the login she picks it I don't even think about it when I review the video I'm like yeah it's fine yeah ultimately you got to have it but it's really about the content and people they don't remember the music anyway right they just remember no and mine's mostly like for this little catchy intro we do with like some cool footage of the area and the logo and stuff like that yeah I love that well let's talk about re-youtuber.com and the course that you offer and because I'm sure we've got a lot of people out there that are love to learn to get how to get 45 leads a 45 closed sales in a year all from YouTube so tell us about the course yeah so the course was just the culmination of the the practice that I was taking to build this thing I did this three years before I even thought about building a course and then I was like well what if I could just put everything together started writing this outline started I started shooting it the same day my house flooded a year ago it was on my calendar my time I'm gonna go ahead and start it like let's just see what happens it I've I'm really proud of how it turned out it's really concise there's not there's no fluff in it some of the videos there's 80 some videos in there some are only two minutes long because it's like hey this is where this thing is go here and do it do it like this but it's it's a culmination of everything I've learned how I tell stories exactly how to play in your videos one of the sections if if somebody reaches out I can give you a 10 day trial and the last section in it is like a shoot with Sam section where I actually pick the topic right out the outline go find the place to shoot it you see me actually like sitting down at a park bench recording the video everybody this watch that section their their feedback is like wow I'm really overthinking this I love that so I love that the shoot so you get to almost see like behind the scenes kind of stuff 100% then I edit the video then I you know make the thumbnail you get to see all of it so do you have somebody that travels with you to to shoot some of this some of the behind the scenes footage or not at all that day I had my partner with me so I could like do it in the car and as we're going but I do it all myself amazing you know it takes me about three hours a week to make one video yeah that's absolutely reasonable that's including uploading thumbnails everything and if so we say let's just say it's three hours a week and let's say it takes you and I'm just making these numbers up but let's say it takes two videos to get one lead or maybe three videos even let's just say it takes three videos before you get one lead you know that's nine hours of work for thousands and thousands of dollars in commission I would do that all day long yeah we've we've closed about half as many deals as we publish videos that's incredible so we've published about 300 videos we've closed around 150 deals so one out of every two video essentially speaking what you're getting one close sale on every two videos yeah that's a pretty good return on investment considering 150 bucks to the editor maybe you know the subscription to the music things you know something and maybe a few other little tools that you use obviously your equipment all of that but that's you buy it once whatever pretty good return on investment there one of the tools people already have also there's free music you get there's like there's so many other ways if you want to do it you'll find the way I wonder to what person you won't probably know this but I'm gonna make a guess and you can tell me if I'm off what percentage of people that reach out to you do not become your client they're like hey I want to talk to you I'll bet you it's less than 10 percent oh wait less than 10 percent yeah yeah yeah because I can tell I can tell right after that they're like I'm talking to other REALTORS I'm like okay you're probably gonna choose them right because I'm not gonna like sell you right yeah I mean look you've only been there three four years somebody comes in and like hey I've been here 25 years I know everything yeah maybe you lose to that person just because experience yeah but it doesn't matter because 90 something percent of everyone who reaches out to you is converting that is I need to hire you to help me with my recruiting I think I lost a buyer like that they were I showed them around for a day like four or five million dollar houses and they're like we're gonna go with this other guy they told me on a zoom call really like sweet about it like we want to pay you for your time I had about 10 hours of work setting everything up driving them all around they sent me five thousand dollars wow they're just thankful for me and the help the thing the value I did provide so it's basically a deal right in a way yeah I didn't have to actually close a deal but you but you did a lot you did work and you were compensated for it I think that's right all right so everyone I want everyone to go to RE real estate RE YouTuber RE YouTuber.com link in our our show notes also really check out Sam's client facing website because people don't only search on YouTube they're also of course searching on Google and everywhere else so Sam has a not just a great YouTube channel he has a great website and notice when you look at his website think about who is this for why did he put it in the way that he did and if you were somebody that was interested in moving to Tampa what would you think about that website would that appeal to you take off your REALTOR hat put on your buyer hat or or maybe a seller hat and go to that website and you will see that that is how he really structured it's not hey I'm Sam I'm the Sam doesn't really do that what he does instead is says here's the content you need and you're gonna choose me because you're gonna fall in love with my content right and that's what's unsaid and that's exactly what has happened so you don't have to be the best pitch person you literally just have to be able to give content that people want and make it in a package that is you know somewhat presentable so RE YouTuber.com is where you can learn Sam mentioned this you might
