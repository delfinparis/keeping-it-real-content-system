[00:04:17] thank you so much. I'm thrilled to be talking to an audience of REALTORS.
[00:04:21] Oh, good. Well, that's our audience. So that's good. Yeah. I got the right guest. This is fantastic.
[00:04:27] Yeah. I'm excited about that. Well, I'm excited to chat with you because I have to be honest,
[00:04:34] I don't always totally understand what the Home Ownership Gap is. But before we get into
[00:04:40] sort of that topic and your newest, your newest book, I'd love to just learn more about you. And
[00:04:45] you have a long and very impressive storied career in this industry. So please tell us a little bit
[00:04:50] more about how you got started and what your careers look like. Okay. Well, I have a long career.
[00:04:57] I'm a grandma. And so I was a banker. And when I was working, it was before
[00:05:07] computerization, fax machines. And I did a lot. I was a training director. And because I was doing
[00:05:15] so much training, I was doing a lot of writing. And then the mortgage bank association of America
[00:05:20] asked me to start doing some writing for them. So I ended up writing about a dozen publications
[00:05:26] for the MBA of America. And so early on in my career, I did a lot of work for the Boston
[00:05:34] Federal Bank, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. And they sent me down to Louisiana for 30 days.
[00:05:42] I lived in a hotel to do fair lending training. And at that same time, the MBA of America asked me
[00:05:49] to write a series of handbooks on fair lending that were commissioned by President Clinton.
[00:05:55] So all of this was about 30 years ago. And so one of the reasons why I decided to write this book
[00:06:01] is because not much has happened in the past 30 years. And I have to say that, you know, in my
[00:06:11] I owned a company that specialized in auditing. And we completed what we called side-by-side
[00:06:20] analysis. So we would take black borrowers who were denied for alone and compare them to the
[00:06:28] the service standards and the loans, the interest rates that they would be charging to white
[00:06:34] borrowers. So you can understand we did this for banks and mortgage lenders covering 50 states.
[00:06:39] I had 25 lawyers on my team. And we ended up auditing about a million loans.
[00:06:47] And the idea was to look for inequity in various markets. Okay. Yes. Yeah. And I,
[00:06:55] you know, when you have that much data, you know, you know, over we did this for a period.
[00:07:01] Actually, my company is still doing this. But what I want to say is I learned more from my students
[00:07:08] because I trained about 10,000 people on diversity and inclusion in banking, consumer
[00:07:14] products all over the country. So teaching in Arizona had a lot of Hispanic people in my class.
[00:07:21] Now these were bankers and mortgage bankers. And then in Louisiana, I listened to the stories
[00:07:27] that my students shared. And so when I every time I came away from, I got up to my hometown
[00:07:36] in Boston. I would come back from doing a big fair lending training program. And I would say
[00:07:42] the problem was my priorities need to self-advocate. And then my staff and I would look at the data
[00:07:50] from our fair lending analysis and we're saying, what is going on here? You know, why are these people
[00:07:55] walking away from these mortgages? They have good credit. They've got the money in the bank.
[00:08:01] Why are they getting denied or worse than that? Why are they withdrawing their applications?
[00:08:06] Then I realized, and I have talked about this in the past, is they need to self-advocate.
[00:08:14] And so what you have in America is you have two types of buyers. You've got the first time
[00:08:19] home buyer and you've got the first generation home buyer. And the first generation home buyer needs
[00:08:25] an advocate. They don't have people that can say, are you kidding me? This firmness hasn't been
[00:08:32] cleaned in 30 years. You know, you can negotiate the price here a little bit. So why I'm happy to be
[00:08:38] speaking to an audience of REALTORS is because you are the front line people that
[00:08:45] build up trust with your customer. And trust is so important, especially in a multicultural market
[00:08:54] where people are going to their grandparents and getting $20, $25,000 cash gifts from them. And no
[00:09:03] if saying to them, you know, your grandparents has to give you a copy of his bank statement.
[00:09:11] And this is why people walk away from their morningages is because we have become so overly
[00:09:17] reliant on technology that the computer isn't capturing these little nuances like part of the
[00:09:25] funds as you gift. And so three weeks after someone applies, they're told, you know, you're all
[00:09:31] said, you've got a good ratio, you're going to get approved. And then all of a sudden after three
[00:09:37] weeks, they get a letter in the mail saying, give funds need to be sourced. And these people are
[00:09:44] saying, are we talking about organic oranges in California here? What are they talking about? We need
[00:09:50] to be sourced. And so what happens is I and I, REALTORS know the most common statement
[00:10:01] that disgruntled mortgage applicants make is, well, why didn't you tell me that on the first place?
[00:10:07] And so the more that we get into artificial intelligence, the more we utilize decision-based
[00:10:15] technology. And the more divide diverse our country becomes. I mean, the multiracial population has
[00:10:27] grown 276% in the past 10 years. And so we have to think about our customers, whoever they are on
[00:10:40] a neighborhood by neighborhood basis. We need to share with them. Not, oh, yeah, you're definitely
[00:10:49] going to get approved for mortgage, but we need to share with them what the process is. And building
[00:10:55] up that trust and that starts and the pre purchased, it starts when they're out looking at listings.
[00:11:03] And they're calling you up and saying, I want to see, you know, three or four homes. And they say,
[00:11:10] what are the interest rates today? That's the first thing they ask. Do you think rates will come
[00:11:14] down? And my advice is, explain to them, you've got to look at the whole package. You've got to
[00:11:22] see what home biograms are available. You have to see what incentives there are. And you have to
[00:11:29] see what kind of loan documentation there is. And even if the rate is a tiny bit higher or maybe
[00:11:36] a quarter or a half percent higher, I want to tell you that the difference in the mortgage payment
[00:11:43] is offset by home appreciation rates that have been more greater than 5% for 10 years in a row.
[00:11:54] And so if the area where you're selling homes is appreciating at a value of 10% a year,
[00:12:03] what you probably is, and you're selling homes that are valued a half a million dollars,
[00:12:10] that's like your customers putting a thousand dollars a week in their secret nest egg
[00:12:18] every year that they live in that house. And the difference in one percent between a
[00:12:25] 6% mortgage and a 7% mortgage on a half a million dollar loan, it's going to be a couple
[00:12:31] hundred dollars a month. Right. No question about it. But when you compare that to a thousand
[00:12:37] dollars a month in the bank appreciation, it's almost like a passive income.
[00:12:44] And so I think that REALTORS play such a vital role in discussing
[00:12:54] building wealth through home equity and having them understand that. And also talking to them
[00:13:02] that the more they take care of their house, moan the lawn, painting, fixing the fence, fixing the
[00:13:09] roof, that is what is going to put money in the bank for their retirement nest egg. They've got to take
[00:13:16] care of the house. And I think that's, I think the REALTORS are frontline to be the advocate
[00:13:30] that mortgage customers need. And I have a whole chapter of my book called Find an Advocate.
[00:13:36] I think that's really important. So you said so much there. I want to unpack a little bit of it.
[00:13:41] So you talked about, I mean, I'm still sort of getting getting caught because I'm very excited to
[00:13:47] this idea of creating sort of almost an annuity payment. Invisible annuity will call it a
[00:13:53] or passive income as you mentioned through just the natural appreciation that we've seen historically.
[00:14:01] But I want to go back to the beginning. And I want to really dial in the sort of two types of
[00:14:06] groups you were mentioning, which is first time home buyers and then first generation buyers.
[00:14:11] And we're talking about, of course, people coming to this country from somewhere else.
[00:14:16] And or just being the first of their generation in their family to ever purchase home.
[00:14:22] So I think this is really important because as I think as real estate professionals, we can
[00:14:29] go straight into the pre-approval. We just want to get the pre-approval letter.
[00:14:34] You know, and we've sort of maybe failed to to think about, hey, this is the person's first time
[00:14:38] going through this process. And there's a financial literacy component that they aren't going to
[00:14:43] likely have as well down as you the professional because of course, yeah, they haven't done that before.
[00:14:49] And also there may be other reasons why maybe they move from another country where it was done
[00:14:53] much differently or maybe they're just hadn't been exposed to lending. And so I think in my awareness
[00:15:02] of people who maybe don't have that financial literacy, and I know I didn't when I first bought
[00:15:08] my condo. I just trusted my lender to do everything. I still don't exactly know what I was doing
[00:15:14] back then. I just gave them whatever they needed. But I would have liked to have learned more.
[00:15:20] But more importantly, we have to remember that people also oftentimes aren't going to speak up
[00:15:26] on their own behalf and say, I certainly want to understand. It can be seen as embarrassing to them
[00:15:30] or humiliating even to not maybe know the answer. I know that I didn't even understand how
[00:15:36] mortgages worked until I was my late 20s. And I was embarrassed to ask them. And I'm like, I think I
[00:15:41] should know. And thankfully at that time we had the internet, I could just Google it and figure it out.
[00:15:45] But a lot of people are just sort of suffer silently. And they don't feel confident enough to say,
[00:15:51] I don't know this. And so I think I wanted just to really bring up this point that educating
[00:15:56] as you were not so suddenly saying is educating your client, making sure they're aware,
[00:16:03] and really giving them a rundown of that process is something that I think as sometimes we just
[00:16:08] take for granted to say, oh, they understand. But likely they may not. They're excited about
[00:16:12] getting the home. They may not be so knowledgeable. So I just wanted to speak to that, you know,
[00:16:18] is this education process, how critical is it for the REALTOR and the lender to really,
[00:16:24] you know, have that education with the client so that they really understand what they're getting into
[00:16:29] so that maybe they can understand too that home appreciation may offset, like as you were saying,
[00:16:34] some of these, you know, these rate changes in the market yesterday, we were at 15-month lows,
[00:16:41] and I don't know where we're at today. But of course things, yeah, six and a half things,
[00:16:45] but things bounce around and by next week, who knows where it is. And there's an election this year
[00:16:49] and all sorts of things that could change that. But yeah, just kind of wanted to get your thoughts
[00:16:55] about the education process to the consumer. Yeah.
[00:16:59] Yeah, it's more well financial education and home ownership education are different things.
[00:17:06] I mean, financial literacy is about maintaining a check-in account and understanding your bills.
[00:17:12] Home buyer counseling is about the care and maintenance of your house and, you know,
[00:17:17] the importance of making your payment on time and understanding the requirement for hazard
[00:17:23] insurance and escrow's. But pre-purchase counseling is about the process of applying for a mortgage,
[00:17:32] getting approved for a mortgage and the settlement process, understanding the fees and the charges.
[00:17:39] But I want to clarify that real estate agents by law, they can't really cross that line and give
[00:17:51] mortgage advice because you know that you own a big company and so they need to walk that, you know,
[00:18:01] tightrope to say, look, I'm only going to discuss with you the process. I can't recommend
[00:18:10] whether you get a fixed rate or an adjustable rate, but I can try to give you some tips and
[00:18:15] understanding. But I think that the biggest part of the process that requires education is
[00:18:25] the approval process and the verification process. Well, let me just walk through a typical
[00:18:33] scenario. The customer waits until the lender asks them for what documents they need to close to
[00:18:42] get approved. Where 90% of loans in America, you have to have a W2 but a pay stop.
[00:18:51] 90% of the loans, you have to have two months bank statements. And so what I've never been able
[00:18:59] to really get clear on and I just want to go back and remind everyone that, you know, we audited
[00:19:06] a million loan files across America and we can see from the communication logs and the documentation
[00:19:14] checklist that the people were told we need your pay stub, we're told we need your W2, a week or two
[00:19:25] or three weeks after they applied for the loan. And what I'm saying is you don't go on Zillow and say
[00:19:31] what do I need to get approved on this? You don't go on lending tree or an aggregator, you know,
[00:19:38] be shopping for rates. No one is going to tell you this is what you need. And so the mistake
[00:19:45] that consumers make and I'm talking about people who are in a lower income, people that buy their
[00:19:52] first home. And I'm also talking about people that make $152,000 or $200,000 a year buying their second
[00:20:00] home. They take the path of least resistance and think they ask me for my take, you know, tax returns,
[00:20:08] I'll give them my tax returns, but the problem is when rates are fluctuating and homes are selling
[00:20:15] and above asking, the homes are flying off the shelf, the pandemic taught us that. Actually,
[00:20:23] we pause for a second because I know you just recently sold your home and I was only going to
[00:20:27] bring this up because you mentioned it, you don't have to give any information other than this one
[00:20:31] number. How quickly did your home just sell within the last, how, how, how much time was I saw? I,
[00:20:40] the listing came out June 28, June 31st. And of course, I got the offer and a couple hours, 45,000
[00:20:50] over asking. And then on June 6th, we signed the contract and that was the day my book came out on
[00:20:56] the day I was on. It's a good day. I know it was a great day. It was signed the contract in
[00:21:01] in Connecticut and in New England, you have to put 10% down on a house and I, you know, I sold my
[00:21:09] townhouse from 1.2 million. And so the buyer put down $125,000. But we also have a very
[00:21:21] flooky condo rule. I was in a townhouse. I don't mind saying this in public. I think it's a terrible
[00:21:30] rule. My REALTOR doesn't like it. None of the REALTOR's like it. And I certainly didn't like it.
[00:21:36] If you're going to get the condo docs, look at them before you buy the house. And so the rule here
[00:21:42] is that the home buyer has 15 days to say whether or not they like the condo docs.
[00:21:49] Ah, interesting. And they can find anything wrong. You know, they don't, they don't like the pool
[00:21:55] maintenance. They'll find something wrong and they try to back out. But what this person did is
[00:22:02] wanted to renegotiate the price. And because she wanted a 30 day closing, I didn't have time to
[00:22:11] buy a place because the famous zip code where I live in, in order to buy the next house, you will have
[00:22:19] to pay all you can't use your pending proceeds to buy the next house. Right. It has to come out of the
[00:22:27] bank, you know, anyway, you know, we're talking about expensive homes. Sure. And so I said, okay, I'll rent.
[00:22:34] So I pay two months rent and blah, blah, blah. I arrange the movers to start packing. So out of the
[00:22:42] 30 days, we're 15 days in. And she said, I changed my mind. I want to offer the, I want to offer the
[00:22:50] asking price. But because I have the bet, I have a wonderful real estate agent who I don't mind saying,
[00:22:59] this is what you're going to do. And between him and my lawyer, we patched it up and met, and kind of
[00:23:08] that halfway. But you know, I just want to end up by saying dozens of deals fall through
[00:23:17] because the home buyer or the buyer, it's not being handled with kid gloves. And so when you anticipate
[00:23:29] little things like the real estate appraisal came in low. So the bank will lower the loan amount.
[00:23:37] And everybody's freaking out because they have to come up with an extra 10 or 20,000
[00:23:43] dollars are the inspection comes back. And everyone's freaking out because something needs to be fixed.
[00:23:50] And the seller closes their arms and said, I'm not fixing it. You know, it's a leaky roof. And so
[00:23:59] it's all it all comes down to how do you save the deal so that the seller can move on and the
[00:24:08] buyer could move in. That kind of has a nice ring too. Sure does. It sounds like a book title. What
[00:24:13] maybe your next book? No, actually, I'm thinking my next book is going to be about condominiums.
[00:24:21] Well, I live in one. So I could, I will appreciate that. I know. I know. Well,
[00:24:26] well, anyway, that's my little story. Yeah, but I was a fixer, and I did a gut renovation. Everything
[00:24:33] took a whole year. The entire house was rebuilt. But I made some money off of it. And so now I'm going
[00:24:44] to move on to another venture 100 miles away from here. Oh, exciting. Yeah, yeah, back toward Boston,
[00:24:52] actually. Well, back, back closer to home, I guess. Yeah, yeah. So, you know, you'd mentioned
[00:25:00] this idea of, you know, as, as REALTORS or real estate agents, I really should say, having to walk
[00:25:10] this tight line between financial, well, we should point out that REALTORS are fiduciaries. And
[00:25:19] do have a financial obligation to do what is in their clients' best interest. But they have to be
[00:25:29] very, we have REALTORS have to be very careful, of course, in, you know, not giving specific financial
[00:25:35] advice that would violate fair housing or violate the code of ethics, but at the same time,
[00:25:41] acting in their clients' best interest. So you had mentioned, you know, in your initial example,
[00:25:46] about how, you know, we look at the rates or rather the clients often look at the rates because
[00:25:51] that's a tangible thing they can kind of lock into. High numbers bad, low numbers good. And yes,
[00:25:57] in general terms, I guess that's accurate. And then, but then there's other nuances to it where
[00:26:02] you were mentioning, you know, hey, if we look at traditional home appreciation and past performance
[00:26:08] does not, of course, equal future results, however, we can use it as a guide to sort of say, how much
[00:26:14] extra is this actually, or would we project this maybe to be based on historical data? And
[00:26:22] that is a really an interesting argument. I'm wondering if more REALTORS were educated to be able
[00:26:28] to have those conversations either with the client directly or with the lender to have with the
[00:26:33] client that maybe that would get a lot of buyers off the fence who maybe are worried about these
[00:26:39] higher rates. Also, there's the whole, you know, cute saying, you know, date the rate, marry the house,
[00:26:46] the idea that, you know, the rate is what it is today, but the home is maybe is a longer term play,
[00:26:53] and there's a refinance possibility, you know, depending on how things shake out with the Fed,
[00:26:58] you know, in the future. So I think there's a literacy component here because right now here in
[00:27:05] Chicago, we are at dangerously low inventory levels. We're only at, I think we have three months or
[00:27:11] four months, we should have 10 or 11 months, I believe would be a healthy market for us. And so
[00:27:16] there's a lot of people, there's not much inventory, and there's a lot of people sitting on the
[00:27:20] sidelines. There's a lot of sellers that are sitting on the sidelines not wanting to give up.
[00:27:24] They're 3% mortgage too. Actually, I wanted to ask you about that. Let's switch to this issue of
[00:27:31] people being locked in sort of hand, golden handcuffed into their, their 3% rate. So,
[00:27:39] you know, that is a, that is a hard, hard thing to give up. I know it's hard for me to even think,
[00:27:45] oh my gosh, if I sold my condo, even if it appreciated, for me then to go to even 6.5%,
[00:27:51] which is not unreasonable, I think, I think that's a not terrible number for, but it's still certainly
[00:27:57] a less exciting number than 3%. So, do we think this is going to create a bottleneck where we have,
[00:28:04] you know, 80 something percent or whatever the number is of homeowners currently are at under
[00:28:08] a 4% rate or wherever they're at? Do we think this is going to create just a stopgap in people wanting
[00:28:15] to move? Yeah, well, the bottlenecking right now in real estate across the country has to do with
[00:28:22] sellers saying, where am I going to go? And I don't want to give up my 2% or 3% mortgage,
[00:28:28] and then have to get another mortgage. But I would like to suggest that you find the baby boomers.
[00:28:36] I am one because, I mean, do you really want to get a mortgage, a 30-year mortgage, when you're
[00:28:42] 65 or 70 years old? Your parent, ask your parents. And so, if you go, if you're looking for,
[00:28:50] you know, those single family detached homes with the little white picket fence,
[00:28:55] this is where you're going to see the most appreciation. Okay, so last year,
[00:29:02] the state of Illinois had an 8.4% annual rate of appreciation, which means a million dollar
[00:29:10] home is growing at the rate of $80,000 a year. That's a good year. Yeah, that's a good year,
[00:29:18] but it has been over 5% nationally for 10 consecutive years. Okay, we're not seeing underwater
[00:29:27] mortgages very often. We're not seeing that. And so, a very wealthy high-end neighborhood
[00:29:39] is going to have what I call, it's going to max out. And so, let's just go to next year,
[00:29:47] 2025. And so, let's just say that the average home in Cook's County is $750,000. And it's been
[00:29:57] appreciating it seven, eight percent a year. And your customers say, this is no way, I can afford
[00:30:04] a $700,000 house. So, the bargains are always going to be in the outlier communities.
[00:30:12] So, you start to spread geographically, I mean, we have saying in the wingland, every mile west
[00:30:20] of Boston, you save a thousand bucks. And so, you can almost use that as I can now, just think
[00:30:26] of it as a radius around your city or your area. Now, if someone can get a house for $400,000
[00:30:35] in this outlier area, I will tell you that that house is going to appreciate and value at a higher
[00:30:43] rate than the inner city, because people are only willing to spend so much on a condominium and a
[00:30:56] they're only going to spend so much for a split-level house that was built in the 70s that you
[00:31:01] think is kind of ugly. They don't want to spend $700,000 or $800,000 for that 70s architecture.
[00:31:09] But you may discover some beautiful new homes that have the Rockinshare porch or they have
[00:31:19] that kind of, what's popular for people today might even be smaller square footage.
[00:31:26] I mean, the National Builders Association has stated that square footage requirements have dropped
[00:31:32] 200 square feet over the past couple of years. That's interesting. Yeah, that has. And you know,
[00:31:39] people have to watch very closely to kind of avoid what was trendy 10 years ago.
[00:31:49] You know, I mean, I don't know about you, DJ, but people with toddlers don't exactly love sliding glass
[00:31:57] door, you know, barn doors anymore, because your kids are sliding them back and forth all that long.
[00:32:05] And then the pandemic, you know, drove everyone was working from home. Now it's more hybrid.
[00:32:12] And so you have two people living in a house that had what's called the Open Floor Plan,
[00:32:18] which is still very popular and it's wonderful. But there's no place to sit in the corner with your
[00:32:25] computer, right? And so now the Open Floor Plan is starting to be less popular. And so my
[00:32:38] my advice to home buyers is it doesn't matter whether you are buying, financing, renovating,
[00:32:50] decorating, or landscaping your house. The final decision has to be yours. So a lot of people are
[00:33:00] decorating their homes because they're following an influencer who says that are a decorator expert
[00:33:07] because they've got, you know, 10,000 followers on Instagram. That's not the reason to paint,
[00:33:14] to do what you call a motif wall, spend $5,000 on a custom painted,
[00:33:22] forest on one side. And I, when I renovated my house three years ago, which I just sold it,
[00:33:31] you know, I practically doubled my money on it. But my joke to my friends was, I'm not decorating.
[00:33:38] I'm not, I'm decorating this for the next buyer. You know, like red cabinets.
[00:33:45] And it was beautiful. The kitchen was gorgeous, but the point is you, your home is an asset,
[00:33:51] even if you live in it for 30 years, for the you do. It is still an asset that needs to be
[00:33:58] protected. And as REALTORS, you all know that if you over-improve or get carried away with your
[00:34:04] customized decorating, it won't sell. And also too, whatever is trendy today is not going to be
[00:34:12] trendy in 12 years. You know, I have all white everything because that's what was cool three years
[00:34:18] ago. And it maybe it still is. But there's going to be a time, let's say 10 years from now,
[00:34:24] when somebody walks in to buy my place and goes, everything's white. Why did anyone ever think that
[00:34:31] was a good idea? And so, and so it's, it is one of one of those things that, if, unless you're selling
[00:34:38] it today, if you're selling it today, then maybe yeah, look at the trends if you can make some changes.
[00:34:43] But, but you're right is, is really thinking about, yes, I need to be comfortable and happy in my own
[00:34:49] home. But I this is also an asset. And we, I'm curious to get your thoughts on this because I've
[00:34:54] heard financial advisors say this, that the home is really only an asset the day you sell it. And the
[00:35:00] day you sell it is really when you find out exactly what that asset is worth, right? Because you,
[00:35:05] number one, you have to live somewhere. So that money is going to most likely, if it's a primary
[00:35:09] residence, go back in to another home. But also, it really, you know, it's, it's, it's an asset that
[00:35:16] appreciates, but again, only to the level of the interest of the next buyer, right? So, so I think
[00:35:22] that you're bringing up a good point is really looking forward as an, as a REALTOR, we need to
[00:35:28] really be, I think, mindful to talk to our, our, our, our buyers in particular about how to,
[00:35:35] how to really preserve this home so that it does become an asset that's more valuable, or at least
[00:35:41] the internal components of it could be possibly, you know, seeing is more valuable than if other
[00:35:47] changes were made. Well, you have to think like an appraiser. You know, when appraiser is going to go
[00:35:52] through a house and there are, let's just say there are seven or eight major parts. And
[00:36:01] when you're doing his comparison and you're doing his analysis, one improvement
[00:36:09] needs to be within a 10% limit. In other words, I'll give you an example. Somebody buys a house for
[00:36:16] $300,000 and then they spend $30,000 on an in-ground pool. But they don't upgrade their furnace,
[00:36:23] they don't upgrade their electricity, and the house needs a roof. The house never had any real
[00:36:28] landscaping. And so when the appraiser appraises the house, you know, let's just say a couple of
[00:36:37] roads, he, he you says a basis and adjustment on his appraiser says the house's worth
[00:36:47] $7,000 more because of the in-ground pool. And the buyer, or the seller, saying, are you kidding me?
[00:36:54] I spent $30,000 on that pool. But $30,000 was, say, 20% of the value of the house. So technically,
[00:37:04] it's considered an over improvement. You know what I mean? It's like putting in $150,000
[00:37:11] kitchen on a $300,000 house, and fish you want it, model that after the bear television show.
[00:37:20] And you put on this huge, you know, double-sized stove, everything is silver, even the walls
[00:37:28] and the cabinets are stainless steel, which to me looks like a hospital. But there are people
[00:37:35] who do that. And then when they go to list the house with a real tour, it says, all right,
[00:37:41] house is worth $300,000. Yeah, but I spent $100,000 on my kitchen. But when the appraiser comes by,
[00:37:49] they're only going to increase it by the level of which the energy star appliances were installed.
[00:37:58] The basement was either finished or it wasn't finished. Even if you have a custom bar
[00:38:04] with built-in bar stoves and a built-in aquarium, it's not going to make the house go up and value.
[00:38:12] And so I think what people need to understand is, as you say, DJ, it is an asset. But in
[00:38:22] property improvements need to be in the middle of the road. Commensurate with the
[00:38:28] incremental. It's like built-ins. I won't look at a house that has a million built-ins because I
[00:38:34] have furniture. I would rather look at furniture. And I'm so sorry. There is, if there is noise going
[00:38:46] by, we have the Chicago air and water show is this weekend. I wasn't sure that that noise. They're
[00:38:58] going to get that happens again. We've been listening. We're right in Lincoln Park and they are
[00:39:02] zooming overhead. So I apologize for that noise. Oh my god. Yeah. Anyway, sorry. Go ahead.
[00:39:10] I could get what I was saying actually. What we were saying that improvements need to be
[00:39:16] commensurate with the whole package. What I can never understand is how often you see a $40
[00:39:25] million home get listed on the market that was bought by billionaire and they never lived there.
[00:39:33] And you think, why do people even bother? I mean, how many buyers out there can afford a $40
[00:39:40] $40 million home? But I want to say something else too because my book is about discrimination.
[00:39:49] My whole practice and my auditing business was about discrimination and I often get asked about
[00:39:58] unintentional buyers and unconscious buyers. And so, DJ, we've been talking about how
[00:40:05] REALTORS can be a trusted advisor without crossing that line of giving advice.
[00:40:12] It's helping people understand the process. But I want to tell you that the reason why we have a 49
[00:40:20] percent mortgage follow-up rate in America. So out of 25 to 30 million mortgage applications that
[00:40:28] are taken, only 15 or 16 million each year result in a closing. Now, this includes 2021 when
[00:40:38] interest rates were below 3 percent, includes 2022 and 2023. So what I learned in the million loans
[00:40:47] that my office audited in the 10,000 students that I had in Detroit, Miami, LA, and Louisiana,
[00:40:57] in Arizona, this is what my takeaway was from what I have seen in my own professional practice
[00:41:07] that people are too shy and you hit upon that earlier, DJ, they're too shy because they don't
[00:41:13] want to rock the boat. Because people from the time they went to, well, I'm talking about Rosa Parks
[00:41:21] when she was in kindergarten, okay, from the time that people were little, they're used to some form
[00:41:31] of unintentional bias or unconscious bias. So then when they go to high school, they sense that
[00:41:38] kind of a bias. So they have a little bit on guard and then it happens when they're on the business world.
[00:41:44] And so when people are buying the house, they don't want to make waves because they're so happy.
[00:41:52] So I, one of the projects, because my office did a lot of fraud projects and predatory lending projects.
[00:42:03] So we analyzed about 10,000 loans that were all Hispanic borrowers in Southern California and
[00:42:11] in Arizona and New Mexico shortly after the 2000 and aid crisis. So we did this work 2009, 2010.
[00:42:19] And so after we did our analysis, this is what we found that the majority of the borrowers had high credit
[00:42:27] scores. They had W2 forms in the file. They had good wages yet. They got subprime loans.
[00:42:36] So what I cleaned from that, that project that we worked on is that people don't want to make waves.
[00:42:44] If the mortgage lender says, oh, I got a 9% mortgage program for you, they say, okay, because
[00:42:55] because of that unintentional bias. And so they're so happy that someone is selling them a home.
[00:43:03] They don't want to rock the boat. And so I say, speak up and self-advocate because
[00:43:11] I mean, as a nation, we have to stop letting that happen.
[00:43:15] I remember suggestion I have and I'm curious to get your thoughts about uncovering one's own unconscious bias.
[00:43:22] I saw 60 minutes piece years and years ago that I want to say, well, one of the Ivy League schools,
[00:43:29] let's say Harvard or it might not be Harvard. But someone developed a very quick computer program
[00:43:35] that would rapid fire ask questions. And before your conscious mind could really get a grasp of
[00:43:42] how we think we should answer the question, the idea was that you would be answering it just
[00:43:48] before you get to that. Wait, is this going to make me sound good or bad? And what I, because I saw
[00:43:53] the study or saw this news piece and I thought, well, I don't think any less of women of minorities.
[00:43:59] Certainly, I must be completely neutral and this test is going to prove them wrong.
[00:44:05] And I took the test and it said you tend to think men are smarter than women.
[00:44:12] And I put it that's what the test said. And that certain races you think that they're less intelligent.
[00:44:19] And I went, no, no, no, but there it was. It was there. And again, we all have these as the point.
[00:44:25] And I thought, you know, boy, I think it's really a good idea to, for all of us, to really understand
[00:44:33] where we have those little unconscious glitches. It's nothing to be ashamed of, but it's something
[00:44:39] to know so that we can make adjustments in our conscious behavior. And I'm curious if you have
[00:44:44] thoughts about that. Yeah. Well, well, first of all, I don't know if that that Ivy League test was
[00:44:52] you know, beta tested. So they really found out the accuracy on that. Sure.
[00:44:57] But there are a there are a few politicians that I would love to see how they do on that.
[00:45:02] Well, sure. But anyway, what I have my own saying because out of all the research that I've done
[00:45:11] and that is unintentional bias isn't about what somebody says or does. It's about how the
[00:45:18] person feels. So when, you know, people as a general rule are not being discriminating. And that's
[00:45:28] why one of the biggest banks in America and the largest federal credit union in America were both
[00:45:33] absolutely 100% adamant. We didn't discriminate against these borrowers. We didn't discriminate.
[00:45:39] But what they're not, they're not understanding what the financial regulators are saying.
[00:45:48] What the Department of Justice is saying, you have to stop ignoring people. You have to stop
[00:45:55] neglecting people. So one of the things that I uncovered in my studies as an auditor and also my
[00:46:03] own research is that there are tens of thousands of people who applied for alone. And they never
[00:46:11] heard back from the bank. And then all of a sudden, 30 days later, they get a letter saying,
[00:46:16] we closed your file for incompleteness. And I would like to say that I like to group together
[00:46:24] lower income households, non-citizens, Hispanics, Blacks, and multiracial people, Asians,
[00:46:34] is what we refer to as a minority. They have a protected basis because all of these people have
[00:46:41] one thing in common. When they're being ignored by a financial institution,
[00:46:50] or any other organization, they think it's because they're not wealthy. They don't have white privilege.
[00:46:58] They think it's because they don't have a lot of money or they think it's because they're buying
[00:47:02] a home in a less expensive neighborhood. This is how they are feeling. I don't deserve additional
[00:47:11] services because I'm less than because I don't have as much as someone else.
[00:47:18] I'm not a rich white guy. And all people who have a non-traditional household structure
[00:47:23] also feel the same way. Sure. So what I'm saying is that unintentional bias, sometimes there's no
[00:47:31] conversation verbally that is taking place between the organization and the consumer. So the
[00:47:39] unconscious is the fact that no one is showing in the mortgage lending industry, a fair lending
[00:47:46] law says that the bank or the mortgage lender has to express a willingness to lend.
[00:47:54] And that is demonstrated through positive information at every point of communication.
[00:48:01] From the time you pick up that phone and say hello until you shake someone's hand when they walk
[00:48:06] out of the closing. You can't promise they're going to get approved. You can't promise the rates
[00:48:11] aren't going to change. But you can promise that you'll give them good customer service.
[00:48:18] And you have to stick to that promise because when people stop calling or they stop, they don't
[00:48:26] call you and say, you know, we're still waiting for your pay stop. It's not up to the buyer to know
[00:48:36] everything they're supposed to provide. They can say, why didn't you tell me that three weeks ago?
[00:48:43] There is nothing more frustrating going through the lending process than three weeks in,
[00:48:49] getting a notice saying, oh, we need this one extra thing. Like you clearly could have, it seems
[00:48:56] to me. I don't think these are evil people that are trying to screw anyone over. But this is
[00:49:02] something that there is some sort of gap in, it's happened to me. It's happened. You know,
[00:49:07] I have an S corporation. That's something else, which can be very tricky. It's not, once
[00:49:14] lenders understand that there's an S corporation and you know, you can get past it. But it looks on
[00:49:19] paper that I am not a good person to lend to for certain price points because I pay myself a
[00:49:24] lower salary because I own this company and et cetera. And that was something that was not
[00:49:29] explained to me. And it was like eventually we got through it. But boy, I would have loved to,
[00:49:35] at every time I go to refinance, I go through this. And there's always documents that don't seem
[00:49:40] to be needed right away and seem to be needed three weeks later. You're absolutely right.
[00:49:44] Well, Alosar, you have a lot of home buyers out there who they make an offer on house and they
[00:49:52] apply for a mortgage in good faith. They have a landlord that they assume in good faith is going
[00:49:59] to give them a good reference saying they paid on time every month for the past two or three years.
[00:50:04] And then a month later when the lender sends out a verification of rent, the landlord says,
[00:50:12] I don't, I'm not feeling out of this for. Well, why not? They don't, they just don't like sign
[00:50:20] in forms. And that is sad, but it happens. Then you have people who get child support.
[00:50:31] And they have an ex-husband whose jealous or upset that the person is buying a house.
[00:50:39] And the borrower says, I, I need you to give me a copy of your statements to prove that you've
[00:50:48] given me this hundred dollars a week all these years. And the guy says, I'm not giving you anything.
[00:50:55] Yeah, I'm still bitter about the divorce or whatever. That's right. And I'll give you another scenario.
[00:51:02] Your roommate from college, after you graduate, you get an apartment and you take turns paying rent.
[00:51:10] Every month, one of you plays half the rent. And then you part ways or what are you,
[00:51:18] you come in one day and you announce, guess what? I'm getting married and my, my fiance and I just bought a house.
[00:51:27] The roommate's just so happy for you, right? So the mortgage lender says, I need to have proof that
[00:51:35] the rent was paid on time the past 15 to 18 months, two years, whatever you got, give it to me.
[00:51:46] And the soon to be ex-room mates says, I'm not giving you a thing.
[00:51:52] And so yeah, you know, it's like these bridesmaid stories. You know, it's almost the same thing
[00:51:58] when people are buying a house. They expect that those people that are providing them with documentation
[00:52:06] are going to be cooperative, doesn't always happen. And the same thing happens when the
[00:52:13] property appraiser comes and finds something broken. And the seller was so nice, the seller offered
[00:52:21] you cookies every time you came by. Oh, you guys are going to love our house. We had so many happy
[00:52:27] members here, blah, blah, blah. And then when you find out that there's an electrical,
[00:52:34] it's $1,500 because electricity is illegal and needs to be brought up to grade.
[00:52:41] She slams dirt on the REALTOR's face, saying, call my lawyer.
[00:52:47] All right.
[00:52:48] You know, all of these things, motions can affect,
[00:52:54] make people lose deals. And so I guess I'm kind of giving you a lot of examples.
[00:53:01] When we're dealing with artificial intelligence, nothing is captured except the person's income.
[00:53:09] They're debt ratio, what they're paying for the house, the house location. It doesn't capture
[00:53:16] irregular income. It doesn't capture self-employment income. There are people working in farms and
[00:53:23] ranches and domestic households. There are people driving Uber by day and they're working at
[00:53:30] Home Depot at night. They've saved $40,000 to buy a house. And the lender is looking for
[00:53:39] wage documentation and your borrowers saying, it's in my phone. I get paid through Venmo. They don't
[00:53:48] have paystuffs for these jobs. And so this is what's falling through the cracks and hurting the
[00:53:57] home buying industry is that decision modeling systems are great for those people who have had
[00:54:05] the same job for five years. Have all their money in one bank. They have, you know,
[00:54:11] accredited scores that are high. Those are, I'm not going to say they're half the buyers in America
[00:54:19] or maybe 60 or 70 percent. But a third of America's are non-salary. And a lot of people are getting
[00:54:27] grants. They're getting job payment assistance, getting funds from their relatives.
[00:54:35] And your AI systems, the algorithm is only picking up the generic transactions.
[00:54:49] Okay, it's not picking up the prepaid points that are being paid by the seller. It's not picking up,
[00:54:56] you know, other incentives that may be included in the transaction. And so it's showing that
[00:55:03] you're short for closing funds. And then the AI system is spitting out a letter saying subject
[00:55:11] to sufficient funds to close no less than $7,100. And it was rolled into the mortgage.
[00:55:24] Right? And so all of these little things lead people in terms of bewilderment, distress.
[00:55:37] And unless they've locked in their raid and have a firm commitment, if there's a mortgage
[00:55:45] contingency, they will get their deposit back and then your deal dies. So the book, by the way,
[00:55:56] is closing the gap in home ownership, rewriting the rules against mortgage discrimination. I would
[00:56:01] love you have a chapter in your book on lost opportunities. Tell us what are these lost opportunities?
[00:56:09] And what can what can we do about them? I am so glad you brought that up because I'm
[00:56:15] fully forgot about it. It's one of my favorite chapters. I call it lost opportunities because,
[00:56:21] of course, the most important opportunity is the one that you can quantify. And that is the
[00:56:27] appreciation, the future appreciation of your home. But the opportunities that cannot be quantified
[00:56:35] is the fact that we have 80 million people in America that are renting an apartment buildings
[00:56:40] and their families are sick because indoor air quality. And so the United States Department of
[00:56:47] Energy did a study, the International Energy Association did a study. The tenants in these
[00:56:55] buildings have no control over their indoor air quality. So all of these harmful things are
[00:57:01] and bacteria are floating through and they're going from unit to unit. And so when people are able
[00:57:09] to get into their own home, they get healthier and they get happier. The other lost opportunity
[00:57:16] is the fact that we have a law that was passed two years ago called the Inflation Reduction Act.
[00:57:27] Just so you know, Kamala Harris was the architect behind that new law. And so let's just say that
[00:57:36] you buy a house and you do $30,000 worth of energy improvements such as solar panels.
[00:57:43] But you didn't take that $30,000 out of the bank, which you don't have probably. You got
[00:57:48] it at an interest-free loan from the state of Illinois. Okay. So then when you have a new HFAC system
[00:57:56] installed or you have your electrical upgrade or you get those sonopanels or you get a charging
[00:58:03] station for your electric car, whatever it is that you do. Up to 30% of what you spent is called
[00:58:12] a bottom line dollar for dollar tax credit. And so if you have, if you spend 30,000, you probably have
[00:58:21] eight to nine thousand dollars subtracted from whatever you own your taxes. Now that law is still in
[00:58:28] effect, it covers everything. Inflation, it covers energy inspections. Now the third lost
[00:58:37] opportunity I want to talk about is that according to Harvard University, there are you know,
[00:58:45] five and a half million people in America that are at risk to a weather-related disasters.
[00:58:51] As you know, we have hurricanes, we have flooding. Now I don't know about you, but people who live
[00:58:57] in an apartment building don't have their landlord's A. Oh, you don't have to pay your rent for six
[00:59:01] months because I know you have to clean up this. Sure. Water problem. But Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
[00:59:07] simultaneously issued letters about a year and a half ago saying that any of their loans that are
[00:59:16] any mortgage in America that was sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all mortgage services automatically
[00:59:23] have permission to put their payment on pause for a weather-related disaster. And so the mortgage
[00:59:31] service, so Fannie Mae's response recovery network has to verify what the terms and the situation
[00:59:39] is of the disaster. And so what the home buyer gets to do is they call someone on the phone,
[00:59:45] it's available in different languages, they explain the situation, their payments are put on paused,
[00:59:51] and depending on the severity of the situation, they could get their payments paused for
[00:59:58] 12 months, possibly 24 months. But listen to this, the counselors that are working is called
[01:00:06] project porch light. And so the people that are working for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and HUD
[01:00:12] are trained to help people with a financial disaster if somebody loses a job, somebody is sick at
[01:00:19] the household. The kid promises you, all right, we're going to put your loan in for a balance,
[01:00:25] but they will listen to everyone. And they actually help with processing the payments for flood insurance.
[01:00:35] They are trusted advocates. And so there isn't anyone that gets this kind of service,
[01:00:42] unless they are a homeowner, which is why I call it lost opportunities.
[01:00:47] I love that. And just sort of to wrap up, I'd love to know some action steps that you think our
[01:00:56] audience can REALTOR's can take to really help their assist their clients through this process
[01:01:04] and really close that home ownership gap. Okay. Well, in my book, I have a whole page to just
[01:01:11] when step by step instructions on how to Google your way through your city or town to find out what
[01:01:17] the town is giving back to its community. So real estate people are out there paving the pavement,
[01:01:24] boots on the ground, right? So whatever your so-called territory is, you go on the internet and
[01:01:32] you look up the housing divisions, you Google home biograms, but here's what you're going to find out.
[01:01:39] There's not only do most municipalities in America on a small basis, city, town, or county,
[01:01:46] parish, if you're in the South, certain states. What they do is they have incentives for people.
[01:01:53] And yes, sometimes they're limited by income, but you know, the income levels are pretty high.
[01:01:58] And a lot of people are qualified. But these cities and towns also have services for veterans. They
[01:02:06] have services, you know, free grants for building handicapped accessory units. You're going to learn
[01:02:13] about what the town gives back to its people when they're buying a house and after they live in it.
[01:02:20] And so I say start googling your way through what incentives are available for your customers.
[01:02:28] And also check out Freddie Mac DPA1, which stands for down payment assistance.1.
[01:02:37] And sometimes the information is limited to lenders, but you know, put up a big fight and say,
[01:02:46] look, I want this information. There are ways to find out ahead of time, especially on the Freddie
[01:02:53] Mac website. And you should find out in advance what down payment assistance is available.
[01:03:01] You do not have to have an offer in a house. You do not need a specific address for someone to
[01:03:07] come back and say, okay, now I can tell you whether or not it's available. That's not true.
[01:03:12] It also HUD has a directory. Yeah, I think that's really smart too. And then this also,
[01:03:20] really we're talking about REALTORS educating themselves on sort of non-traditional
[01:03:27] options that maybe apply to certain groups that maybe they haven't yet worked with or certain
[01:03:33] demographic people that fall into certain demographics or geographics. But there's also,
[01:03:40] you know, we're talking about kind of understanding the alternative options that exist. And again,
[01:03:47] I am technically an employee of my own company. But do I really understand, you know, lending with
[01:03:54] when somebody has an S corporation? Not really. So even I would have to, you know,
[01:04:00] I think this is a great opportunity to partner with the lender as well, who's well-versed in some
[01:04:04] of these, you know, grants. And really, you know, I think this is an opportunity to create education
[01:04:11] around I see people, agents successful REALTORS doing, you know, so you want to buy your first home
[01:04:17] kind of a webinar. And they partner with, with, you know, other experts. And you do seem at
[01:04:25] least here in Chicago. I go to some of these and I do see it seems to me to be a lot of minority
[01:04:31] people attending, people who maybe haven't purchased their first home. They seem to be super
[01:04:36] interested and asking a lot of questions. And it's really, it's really encouraging to see agents
[01:04:42] who are doing that because they're certainly, you know, and I appreciate also the consumer who's
[01:04:49] like, I want to learn, but they have to learn from somebody. And I think maybe becoming that knowledge
[01:04:54] source, or at least aligning yourself with those knowledge sources seems to be a really, really
[01:04:59] great idea. And I wanted to, I wanted to just, I would be remiss wrapping up, I wanted to ask you
[01:05:08] a little bit just, I know you could talk about this for probably a very long time, but any thoughts
[01:05:13] about the NAR settlement, not so much in whether you like it or not, but where do you think it's
[01:05:20] going to push our industry? Do you have any, any thoughts of, you know, what you think might be,
[01:05:26] what might start to happen as a result of some of the new changes?
[01:05:31] Well, it is not helping to close the home ownership gap because people are not going to start
[01:05:37] knocking on the door. It's like, can I buy your house? I mean, that's just not going to happen.
[01:05:44] I've seen a little bit, a little bit written on this. I think the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, FHA,
[01:05:53] and BA is 0% down, but I think that some allowances are going to be made for the bioprogram fee,
[01:06:02] whether it's the bioregion fee, I should say, whether it's 2%, 1.5% to 2.5% whatever that fee is,
[01:06:11] as long as it's disclosed, I have a feeling that it will be netted out from what the house needs
[01:06:21] to appraise at. You know, I think that there'll be a few adjustments that have to be made, but
[01:06:28] you know, I mean, you're familiar with the fact that when people get a mortgage with minimum down,
[01:06:34] I have to have two or three months payment reserves. That has always been a stretch for people.
[01:06:40] After $5,000 or $10,000 in the bank. But if you're buying a house of $400,000 and you're a bioregion fee,
[01:06:49] it is going to be $8,000. There's no way you're going to be able to afford the down payment,
[01:06:55] closing costs, reserves, and that fee. So I think what you're going to see is
[01:07:04] rolling it into the cost of the mortgage is one option. It's like financing the points.
[01:07:11] But I also think, you know, we're talking about a 50-50 MLS system that worked very nicely for
[01:07:23] 40 years. And out of nowhere, it's completely changed. And I know when I sold my house, I mean,
[01:07:34] my broker got a $60,000 condition because nobody was going to change the way they do anything
[01:07:42] where I live. And even though the house sold at an hour, there's no discounts, no open house,
[01:07:49] either nothing. So yeah, it was a full, it was a 5% or 6%. No, I can't remember.
[01:07:58] I think it was 5%. So I think that what you're going to see is that after a while,
[01:08:10] when I'm quoting technology here, the old IBM comment, when things don't work smoothly as
[01:08:21] was expected, after a while people go back to doing things the old way. Right? If it doesn't
[01:08:30] broke, it's not broken, don't fix it. I don't think that, I know it's a new rule going into place,
[01:08:38] but by gut feeling is that it's not going to be around forever. I think it's going to hurt the
[01:08:44] industry. I mean, I wrote the book, but everyone across the country is doing everything to help
[01:08:53] close the racial gap in homeownership. And this new rule is doing the opposite.
[01:09:01] It's certainly making it harder for lower income people to be able to afford their first home.
[01:09:08] It's not just that. It's the whole concept. It just doesn't really make any sense.
[01:09:18] I think that somebody in their evil mastermind thought that Redfin and Zillow and all of the online
[01:09:29] companies were going to be the primer, were going to disrupt the market, as digital disruption
[01:09:37] people, people go buy a home virtually. And we all know that hasn't really happened. Yeah.
[01:09:44] If you talk to some of praises, or real estate appraisal is almost like a,
[01:09:53] what do they call those personal descriptions on a dating site?
[01:09:59] Everybody is in great condition in their athletic and they work out on their gorgeous,
[01:10:04] while a real estate appraiser will write up the house the same way.
[01:10:09] And so, to have a virtual business for buying and selling is not always good.
[01:10:21] All right, well, the book, the book again, is closing the gap in homeownership, rewriting the rules
[01:10:27] against mortgage discrimination. It is available everywhere. Books are sold specifically for free
[01:10:33] right now on Amazon. If you have Amazon Prime or Kindle, I believe it's currently free.

I want you to check out her website because it's chock full of great information. It is Anna D. Simone.net. And that is thank you so much. I'm thrilled to be talking to an audience of REALTORS. Oh, good. Well, that's our audience. So that's good. Yeah. I got the right guest. This is fantastic. Yeah. I'm excited about that. Well, I'm excited to chat with you because I have to be honest, I don't always totally understand what the Home Ownership Gap is. But before we get into sort of that topic and your newest, your newest book, I'd love to just learn more about you. And you have a long and very impressive storied career in this industry. So please tell us a little bit more about how you got started and what your careers look like. Okay. Well, I have a long career. I'm a grandma. And so I was a banker. And when I was working, it was before computerization, fax machines. And I did a lot. I was a training director. And because I was doing so much training, I was doing a lot of writing. And then the mortgage bank association of America asked me to start doing some writing for them. So I ended up writing about a dozen publications for the MBA of America. And so early on in my career, I did a lot of work for the Boston Federal Bank, the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. And they sent me down to Louisiana for 30 days. I lived in a hotel to do fair lending training. And at that same time, the MBA of America asked me to write a series of handbooks on fair lending that were commissioned by President Clinton. So all of this was about 30 years ago. And so one of the reasons why I decided to write this book is because not much has happened in the past 30 years. And I have to say that, you know, in my I owned a company that specialized in auditing. And we completed what we called side-by-side analysis. So we would take black borrowers who were denied for alone and compare them to the the service standards and the loans, the interest rates that they would be charging to white borrowers. So you can understand we did this for banks and mortgage lenders covering 50 states. I had 25 lawyers on my team. And we ended up auditing about a million loans. And the idea was to look for inequity in various markets. Okay. Yes. Yeah. And I, you know, when you have that much data, you know, you know, over we did this for a period. Actually, my company is still doing this. But what I want to say is I learned more from my students because I trained about 10,000 people on diversity and inclusion in banking, consumer products all over the country. So teaching in Arizona had a lot of Hispanic people in my class. Now these were bankers and mortgage bankers. And then in Louisiana, I listened to the stories that my students shared. And so when I every time I came away from, I got up to my hometown in Boston. I would come back from doing a big fair lending training program. And I would say the problem was my priorities need to self-advocate. And then my staff and I would look at the data from our fair lending analysis and we're saying, what is going on here? You know, why are these people walking away from these mortgages? They have good credit. They've got the money in the bank. Why are they getting denied or worse than that? Why are they withdrawing their applications? Then I realized, and I have talked about this in the past, is they need to self-advocate. And so what you have in America is you have two types of buyers. You've got the first time home buyer and you've got the first generation home buyer. And the first generation home buyer needs an advocate. They don't have people that can say, are you kidding me? This firmness hasn't been cleaned in 30 years. You know, you can negotiate the price here a little bit. So why I'm happy to be speaking to an audience of REALTORS is because you are the front line people that build up trust with your customer. And trust is so important, especially in a multicultural market where people are going to their grandparents and getting $20, $25,000 cash gifts from them. And no if saying to them, you know, your grandparents has to give you a copy of his bank statement. And this is why people walk away from their morningages is because we have become so overly reliant on technology that the computer isn't capturing these little nuances like part of the funds as you gift. And so three weeks after someone applies, they're told, you know, you're all said, you've got a good ratio, you're going to get approved. And then all of a sudden after three weeks, they get a letter in the mail saying, give funds need to be sourced. And these people are saying, are we talking about organic oranges in California here? What are they talking about? We need to be sourced. And so what happens is I and I, REALTORS know the most common statement that disgruntled mortgage applicants make is, well, why didn't you tell me that on the first place? And so the more that we get into artificial intelligence, the more we utilize decision-based technology. And the more divide diverse our country becomes. I mean, the multiracial population has grown 276% in the past 10 years. And so we have to think about our customers, whoever they are on a neighborhood by neighborhood basis. We need to share with them. Not, oh, yeah, you're definitely going to get approved for mortgage, but we need to share with them what the process is. And building up that trust and that starts and the pre purchased, it starts when they're out looking at listings. And they're calling you up and saying, I want to see, you know, three or four homes. And they say, what are the interest rates today? That's the first thing they ask. Do you think rates will come down? And my advice is, explain to them, you've got to look at the whole package. You've got to see what home biograms are available. You have to see what incentives there are. And you have to see what kind of loan documentation there is. And even if the rate is a tiny bit higher or maybe a quarter or a half percent higher, I want to tell you that the difference in the mortgage payment is offset by home appreciation rates that have been more greater than 5% for 10 years in a row. And so if the area where you're selling homes is appreciating at a value of 10% a year, what you probably is, and you're selling homes that are valued a half a million dollars, that's like your customers putting a thousand dollars a week in their secret nest egg every year that they live in that house. And the difference in one percent between a 6% mortgage and a 7% mortgage on a half a million dollar loan, it's going to be a couple hundred dollars a month. Right. No question about it. But when you compare that to a thousand dollars a month in the bank appreciation, it's almost like a passive income. And so I think that REALTORS play such a vital role in discussing building wealth through home equity and having them understand that. And also talking to them that the more they take care of their house, moan the lawn, painting, fixing the fence, fixing the roof, that is what is going to put money in the bank for their retirement nest egg. They've got to take care of the house. And I think that's, I think the REALTORS are frontline to be the advocate that mortgage customers need. And I have a whole chapter of my book called Find an Advocate. I think that's really important. So you said so much there. I want to unpack a little bit of it. So you talked about, I mean, I'm still sort of getting getting caught because I'm very excited to this idea of creating sort of almost an annuity payment. Invisible annuity will call it a or passive income as you mentioned through just the natural appreciation that we've seen historically. But I want to go back to the beginning. And I want to really dial in the sort of two types of groups you were mentioning, which is first time home buyers and then first generation buyers. And we're talking about, of course, people coming to this country from somewhere else. And or just being the first of their generation in their family to ever purchase home. So I think this is really important because as I think as real estate professionals, we can go straight into the pre-approval. We just want to get the pre-approval letter. You know, and we've sort of maybe failed to to think about, hey, this is the person's first time going through this process. And there's a financial literacy component that they aren't going to likely have as well down as you the professional because of course, yeah, they haven't done that before. And also there may be other reasons why maybe they move from another country where it was done much differently or maybe they're just hadn't been exposed to lending. And so I think in my awareness of people who maybe don't have that financial literacy, and I know I didn't when I first bought my condo. I just trusted my lender to do everything. I still don't exactly know what I was doing back then. I just gave them whatever they needed. But I would have liked to have learned more. But more importantly, we have to remember that people also oftentimes aren't going to speak up on their own behalf and say, I certainly want to understand. It can be seen as embarrassing to them or humiliating even to not maybe know the answer. I know that I didn't even understand how mortgages worked until I was my late 20s. And I was embarrassed to ask them. And I'm like, I think I should know. And thankfully at that time we had the internet, I could just Google it and figure it out. But a lot of people are just sort of suffer silently. And they don't feel confident enough to say, I don't know this. And so I think I wanted just to really bring up this point that educating as you were not so suddenly saying is educating your client, making sure they're aware, and really giving them a rundown of that process is something that I think as sometimes we just take for granted to say, oh, they understand. But likely they may not. They're excited about getting the home. They may not be so knowledgeable. So I just wanted to speak to that, you know, is this education process, how critical is it for the REALTOR and the lender to really, you know, have that education with the client so that they really understand what they're getting into so that maybe they can understand too that home appreciation may offset, like as you were saying, some of these, you know, these rate changes in the market yesterday, we were at 15-month lows, and I don't know where we're at today. But of course things, yeah, six and a half things, but things bounce around and by next week, who knows where it is. And there's an election this year and all sorts of things that could change that. But yeah, just kind of wanted to get your thoughts about the education process to the consumer. Yeah. Yeah, it's more well financial education and home ownership education are different things. I mean, financial literacy is about maintaining a check-in account and understanding your bills. Home buyer counseling is about the care and maintenance of your house and, you know, the importance of making your payment on time and understanding the requirement for hazard insurance and escrow's. But pre-purchase counseling is about the process of applying for a mortgage, getting approved for a mortgage and the settlement process, understanding the fees and the charges. But I want to clarify that real estate agents by law, they can't really cross that line and give mortgage advice because you know that you own a big company and so they need to walk that, you know, tightrope to say, look, I'm only going to discuss with you the process. I can't recommend whether you get a fixed rate or an adjustable rate, but I can try to give you some tips and understanding. But I think that the biggest part of the process that requires education is the approval process and the verification process. Well, let me just walk through a typical scenario. The customer waits until the lender asks them for what documents they need to close to get approved. Where 90% of loans in America, you have to have a W2 but a pay stop. 90% of the loans, you have to have two months bank statements. And so what I've never been able to really get clear on and I just want to go back and remind everyone that, you know, we audited a million loan files across America and we can see from the communication logs and the documentation checklist that the people were told we need your pay stub, we're told we need your W2, a week or two or three weeks after they applied for the loan. And what I'm saying is you don't go on Zillow and say what do I need to get approved on this? You don't go on lending tree or an aggregator, you know, be shopping for rates. No one is going to tell you this is what you need. And so the mistake that consumers make and I'm talking about people who are in a lower income, people that buy their first home. And I'm also talking about people that make $152,000 or $200,000 a year buying their second home. They take the path of least resistance and think they ask me for my take, you know, tax returns, I'll give them my tax returns, but the problem is when rates are fluctuating and homes are selling and above asking, the homes are flying off the shelf, the pandemic taught us that. Actually, we pause for a second because I know you just recently sold your home and I was only going to bring this up because you mentioned it, you don't have to give any information other than this one number. How quickly did your home just sell within the last, how, how, how much time was I saw? I, the listing came out June 28, June 31st. And of course, I got the offer and a couple hours, 45,000 over asking. And then on June 6th, we signed the contract and that was the day my book came out on the day I was on. It's a good day. I know it was a great day. It was signed the contract in in Connecticut and in New England, you have to put 10% down on a house and I, you know, I sold my townhouse from 1.2 million. And so the buyer put down $125,000. But we also have a very flooky condo rule. I was in a townhouse. I don't mind saying this in public. I think it's a terrible rule. My REALTOR doesn't like it. None of the REALTOR's like it. And I certainly didn't like it. If you're going to get the condo docs, look at them before you buy the house. And so the rule here is that the home buyer has 15 days to say whether or not they like the condo docs. Ah, interesting. And they can find anything wrong. You know, they don't, they don't like the pool maintenance. They'll find something wrong and they try to back out. But what this person did is wanted to renegotiate the price. And because she wanted a 30 day closing, I didn't have time to buy a place because the famous zip code where I live in, in order to buy the next house, you will have to pay all you can't use your pending proceeds to buy the next house. Right. It has to come out of the bank, you know, anyway, you know, we're talking about expensive homes. Sure. And so I said, okay, I'll rent. So I pay two months rent and blah, blah, blah. I arrange the movers to start packing. So out of the 30 days, we're 15 days in. And she said, I changed my mind. I want to offer the, I want to offer the asking price. But because I have the bet, I have a wonderful real estate agent who I don't mind saying, this is what you're going to do. And between him and my lawyer, we patched it up and met, and kind of that halfway. But you know, I just want to end up by saying dozens of deals fall through because the home buyer or the buyer, it's not being handled with kid gloves. And so when you anticipate little things like the real estate appraisal came in low. So the bank will lower the loan amount. And everybody's freaking out because they have to come up with an extra 10 or 20,000 dollars are the inspection comes back. And everyone's freaking out because something needs to be fixed. And the seller closes their arms and said, I'm not fixing it. You know, it's a leaky roof. And so it's all it all comes down to how do you save the deal so that the seller can move on and the buyer could move in. That kind of has a nice ring too. Sure does. It sounds like a book title. What maybe your next book? No, actually, I'm thinking my next book is going to be about condominiums. Well, I live in one. So I could, I will appreciate that. I know. I know. Well, well, anyway, that's my little story. Yeah, but I was a fixer, and I did a gut renovation. Everything took a whole year. The entire house was rebuilt. But I made some money off of it. And so now I'm going to move on to another venture 100 miles away from here. Oh, exciting. Yeah, yeah, back toward Boston, actually. Well, back, back closer to home, I guess. Yeah, yeah. So, you know, you'd mentioned this idea of, you know, as, as REALTORS or real estate agents, I really should say, having to walk this tight line between financial, well, we should point out that REALTORS are fiduciaries. And do have a financial obligation to do what is in their clients' best interest. But they have to be very, we have REALTORS have to be very careful, of course, in, you know, not giving specific financial advice that would violate fair housing or violate the code of ethics, but at the same time, acting in their clients' best interest. So you had mentioned, you know, in your initial example, about how, you know, we look at the rates or rather the clients often look at the rates because that's a tangible thing they can kind of lock into. High numbers bad, low numbers good. And yes, in general terms, I guess that's accurate. And then, but then there's other nuances to it where you were mentioning, you know, hey, if we look at traditional home appreciation and past performance does not, of course, equal future results, however, we can use it as a guide to sort of say, how much extra is this actually, or would we project this maybe to be based on historical data? And that is a really an interesting argument. I'm wondering if more REALTORS were educated to be able to have those conversations either with the client directly or with the lender to have with the client that maybe that would get a lot of buyers off the fence who maybe are worried about these higher rates. Also, there's the whole, you know, cute saying, you know, date the rate, marry the house, the idea that, you know, the rate is what it is today, but the home is maybe is a longer term play, and there's a refinance possibility, you know, depending on how things shake out with the Fed, you know, in the future. So I think there's a literacy component here because right now here in Chicago, we are at dangerously low inventory levels. We're only at, I think we have three months or four months, we should have 10 or 11 months, I believe would be a healthy market for us. And so there's a lot of people, there's not much inventory, and there's a lot of people sitting on the sidelines. There's a lot of sellers that are sitting on the sidelines not wanting to give up. They're 3% mortgage too. Actually, I wanted to ask you about that. Let's switch to this issue of people being locked in sort of hand, golden handcuffed into their, their 3% rate. So, you know, that is a, that is a hard, hard thing to give up. I know it's hard for me to even think, oh my gosh, if I sold my condo, even if it appreciated, for me then to go to even 6.5%, which is not unreasonable, I think, I think that's a not terrible number for, but it's still certainly a less exciting number than 3%. So, do we think this is going to create a bottleneck where we have, you know, 80 something percent or whatever the number is of homeowners currently are at under a 4% rate or wherever they're at? Do we think this is going to create just a stopgap in people wanting to move? Yeah, well, the bottlenecking right now in real estate across the country has to do with sellers saying, where am I going to go? And I don't want to give up my 2% or 3% mortgage, and then have to get another mortgage. But I would like to suggest that you find the baby boomers. I am one because, I mean, do you really want to get a mortgage, a 30-year mortgage, when you're 65 or 70 years old? Your parent, ask your parents. And so, if you go, if you're looking for, you know, those single family detached homes with the little white picket fence, this is where you're going to see the most appreciation. Okay, so last year, the state of Illinois had an 8.4% annual rate of appreciation, which means a million dollar home is growing at the rate of $80,000 a year. That's a good year. Yeah, that's a good year, but it has been over 5% nationally for 10 consecutive years. Okay, we're not seeing underwater mortgages very often. We're not seeing that. And so, a very wealthy high-end neighborhood is going to have what I call, it's going to max out. And so, let's just go to next year, 2025. And so, let's just say that the average home in Cook's County is $750,000. And it's been appreciating it seven, eight percent a year. And your customers say, this is no way, I can afford a $700,000 house. So, the bargains are always going to be in the outlier communities. So, you start to spread geographically, I mean, we have saying in the wingland, every mile west of Boston, you save a thousand bucks. And so, you can almost use that as I can now, just think of it as a radius around your city or your area. Now, if someone can get a house for $400,000 in this outlier area, I will tell you that that house is going to appreciate and value at a higher rate than the inner city, because people are only willing to spend so much on a condominium and a they're only going to spend so much for a split-level house that was built in the 70s that you think is kind of ugly. They don't want to spend $700,000 or $800,000 for that 70s architecture. But you may discover some beautiful new homes that have the Rockinshare porch or they have that kind of, what's popular for people today might even be smaller square footage. I mean, the National Builders Association has stated that square footage requirements have dropped 200 square feet over the past couple of years. That's interesting. Yeah, that has. And you know, people have to watch very closely to kind of avoid what was trendy 10 years ago. You know, I mean, I don't know about you, DJ, but people with toddlers don't exactly love sliding glass door, you know, barn doors anymore, because your kids are sliding them back and forth all that long. And then the pandemic, you know, drove everyone was working from home. Now it's more hybrid. And so you have two people living in a house that had what's called the Open Floor Plan, which is still very popular and it's wonderful. But there's no place to sit in the corner with your computer, right? And so now the Open Floor Plan is starting to be less popular. And so my my advice to home buyers is it doesn't matter whether you are buying, financing, renovating, decorating, or landscaping your house. The final decision has to be yours. So a lot of people are decorating their homes because they're following an influencer who says that are a decorator expert because they've got, you know, 10,000 followers on Instagram. That's not the reason to paint, to do what you call a motif wall, spend $5,000 on a custom painted, forest on one side. And I, when I renovated my house three years ago, which I just sold it, you know, I practically doubled my money on it. But my joke to my friends was, I'm not decorating. I'm not, I'm decorating this for the next buyer. You know, like red cabinets. And it was beautiful. The kitchen was gorgeous, but the point is you, your home is an asset, even if you live in it for 30 years, for the you do. It is still an asset that needs to be protected. And as REALTORS, you all know that if you over-improve or get carried away with your customized decorating, it won't sell. And also too, whatever is trendy today is not going to be trendy in 12 years. You know, I have all white everything because that's what was cool three years ago. And it maybe it still is. But there's going to be a time, let's say 10 years from now, when somebody walks in to buy my place and goes, everything's white. Why did anyone ever think that was a good idea? And so, and so it's, it is one of one of those things that, if, unless you're selling it today, if you're selling it today, then maybe yeah, look at the trends if you can make some changes. But, but you're right is, is really thinking about, yes, I need to be comfortable and happy in my own home. But I this is also an asset. And we, I'm curious to get your thoughts on this because I've heard financial advisors say this, that the home is really only an asset the day you sell it. And the day you sell it is really when you find out exactly what that asset is worth, right? Because you, number one, you have to live somewhere. So that money is going to most likely, if it's a primary residence, go back in to another home. But also, it really, you know, it's, it's, it's an asset that appreciates, but again, only to the level of the interest of the next buyer, right? So, so I think that you're bringing up a good point is really looking forward as an, as a REALTOR, we need to really be, I think, mindful to talk to our, our, our, our buyers in particular about how to, how to really preserve this home so that it does become an asset that's more valuable, or at least the internal components of it could be possibly, you know, seeing is more valuable than if other changes were made. Well, you have to think like an appraiser. You know, when appraiser is going to go through a house and there are, let's just say there are seven or eight major parts. And when you're doing his comparison and you're doing his analysis, one improvement needs to be within a 10% limit. In other words, I'll give you an example. Somebody buys a house for $300,000 and then they spend $30,000 on an in-ground pool. But they don't upgrade their furnace, they don't upgrade their electricity, and the house needs a roof. The house never had any real landscaping. And so when the appraiser appraises the house, you know, let's just say a couple of roads, he, he you says a basis and adjustment on his appraiser says the house's worth $7,000 more because of the in-ground pool. And the buyer, or the seller, saying, are you kidding me? I spent $30,000 on that pool. But $30,000 was, say, 20% of the value of the house. So technically, it's considered an over improvement. You know what I mean? It's like putting in $150,000 kitchen on a $300,000 house, and fish you want it, model that after the bear television show. And you put on this huge, you know, double-sized stove, everything is silver, even the walls and the cabinets are stainless steel, which to me looks like a hospital. But there are people who do that. And then when they go to list the house with a real tour, it says, all right, house is worth $300,000. Yeah, but I spent $100,000 on my kitchen. But when the appraiser comes by, they're only going to increase it by the level of which the energy star appliances were installed. The basement was either finished or it wasn't finished. Even if you have a custom bar with built-in bar stoves and a built-in aquarium, it's not going to make the house go up and value. And so I think what people need to understand is, as you say, DJ, it is an asset. But in property improvements need to be in the middle of the road. Commensurate with the incremental. It's like built-ins. I won't look at a house that has a million built-ins because I have furniture. I would rather look at furniture. And I'm so sorry. There is, if there is noise going by, we have the Chicago air and water show is this weekend. I wasn't sure that that noise. They're going to get that happens again. We've been listening. We're right in Lincoln Park and they are zooming overhead. So I apologize for that noise. Oh my god. Yeah. Anyway, sorry. Go ahead. I could get what I was saying actually. What we were saying that improvements need to be commensurate with the whole package. What I can never understand is how often you see a $40 million home get listed on the market that was bought by billionaire and they never lived there. And you think, why do people even bother? I mean, how many buyers out there can afford a $40 $40 million home? But I want to say something else too because my book is about discrimination. My whole practice and my auditing business was about discrimination and I often get asked about unintentional buyers and unconscious buyers. And so, DJ, we've been talking about how REALTORS can be a trusted advisor without crossing that line of giving advice. It's helping people understand the process. But I want to tell you that the reason why we have a 49 percent mortgage follow-up rate in America. So out of 25 to 30 million mortgage applications that are taken, only 15 or 16 million each year result in a closing. Now, this includes 2021 when interest rates were below 3 percent, includes 2022 and 2023. So what I learned in the million loans that my office audited in the 10,000 students that I had in Detroit, Miami, LA, and Louisiana, in Arizona, this is what my takeaway was from what I have seen in my own professional practice that people are too shy and you hit upon that earlier, DJ, they're too shy because they don't want to rock the boat. Because people from the time they went to, well, I'm talking about Rosa Parks when she was in kindergarten, okay, from the time that people were little, they're used to some form of unintentional bias or unconscious bias. So then when they go to high school, they sense that kind of a bias. So they have a little bit on guard and then it happens when they're on the business world. And so when people are buying the house, they don't want to make waves because they're so happy. So I, one of the projects, because my office did a lot of fraud projects and predatory lending projects. So we analyzed about 10,000 loans that were all Hispanic borrowers in Southern California and in Arizona and New Mexico shortly after the 2000 and aid crisis. So we did this work 2009, 2010. And so after we did our analysis, this is what we found that the majority of the borrowers had high credit scores. They had W2 forms in the file. They had good wages yet. They got subprime loans. So what I cleaned from that, that project that we worked on is that people don't want to make waves. If the mortgage lender says, oh, I got a 9% mortgage program for you, they say, okay, because because of that unintentional bias. And so they're so happy that someone is selling them a home. They don't want to rock the boat. And so I say, speak up and self-advocate because I mean, as a nation, we have to stop letting that happen. I remember suggestion I have and I'm curious to get your thoughts about uncovering one's own unconscious bias. I saw 60 minutes piece years and years ago that I want to say, well, one of the Ivy League schools, let's say Harvard or it might not be Harvard. But someone developed a very quick computer program that would rapid fire ask questions. And before your conscious mind could really get a grasp of how we think we should answer the question, the idea was that you would be answering it just before you get to that. Wait, is this going to make me sound good or bad? And what I, because I saw the study or saw this news piece and I thought, well, I don't think any less of women of minorities. Certainly, I must be completely neutral and this test is going to prove them wrong. And I took the test and it said you tend to think men are smarter than women. And I put it that's what the test said. And that certain races you think that they're less intelligent. And I went, no, no, no, but there it was. It was there. And again, we all have these as the point. And I thought, you know, boy, I think it's really a good idea to, for all of us, to really understand where we have those little unconscious glitches. It's nothing to be ashamed of, but it's something to know so that we can make adjustments in our conscious behavior. And I'm curious if you have thoughts about that. Yeah. Well, well, first of all, I don't know if that that Ivy League test was you know, beta tested. So they really found out the accuracy on that. Sure. But there are a there are a few politicians that I would love to see how they do on that. Well, sure. But anyway, what I have my own saying because out of all the research that I've done and that is unintentional bias isn't about what somebody says or does. It's about how the person feels. So when, you know, people as a general rule are not being discriminating. And that's why one of the biggest banks in America and the largest federal credit union in America were both absolutely 100% adamant. We didn't discriminate against these borrowers. We didn't discriminate. But what they're not, they're not understanding what the financial regulators are saying. What the Department of Justice is saying, you have to stop ignoring people. You have to stop neglecting people. So one of the things that I uncovered in my studies as an auditor and also my own research is that there are tens of thousands of people who applied for alone. And they never heard back from the bank. And then all of a sudden, 30 days later, they get a letter saying, we closed your file for incompleteness. And I would like to say that I like to group together lower income households, non-citizens, Hispanics, Blacks, and multiracial people, Asians, is what we refer to as a minority. They have a protected basis because all of these people have one thing in common. When they're being ignored by a financial institution, or any other organization, they think it's because they're not wealthy. They don't have white privilege. They think it's because they don't have a lot of money or they think it's because they're buying a home in a less expensive neighborhood. This is how they are feeling. I don't deserve additional services because I'm less than because I don't have as much as someone else. I'm not a rich white guy. And all people who have a non-traditional household structure also feel the same way. Sure. So what I'm saying is that unintentional bias, sometimes there's no conversation verbally that is taking place between the organization and the consumer. So the unconscious is the fact that no one is showing in the mortgage lending industry, a fair lending law says that the bank or the mortgage lender has to express a willingness to lend. And that is demonstrated through positive information at every point of communication. From the time you pick up that phone and say hello until you shake someone's hand when they walk out of the closing. You can't promise they're going to get approved. You can't promise the rates aren't going to change. But you can promise that you'll give them good customer service. And you have to stick to that promise because when people stop calling or they stop, they don't call you and say, you know, we're still waiting for your pay stop. It's not up to the buyer to know everything they're supposed to provide. They can say, why didn't you tell me that three weeks ago? There is nothing more frustrating going through the lending process than three weeks in, getting a notice saying, oh, we need this one extra thing. Like you clearly could have, it seems to me. I don't think these are evil people that are trying to screw anyone over. But this is something that there is some sort of gap in, it's happened to me. It's happened. You know, I have an S corporation. That's something else, which can be very tricky. It's not, once lenders understand that there's an S corporation and you know, you can get past it. But it looks on paper that I am not a good person to lend to for certain price points because I pay myself a lower salary because I own this company and et cetera. And that was something that was not explained to me. And it was like eventually we got through it. But boy, I would have loved to, at every time I go to refinance, I go through this. And there's always documents that don't seem to be needed right away and seem to be needed three weeks later. You're absolutely right. Well, Alosar, you have a lot of home buyers out there who they make an offer on house and they apply for a mortgage in good faith. They have a landlord that they assume in good faith is going to give them a good reference saying they paid on time every month for the past two or three years. And then a month later when the lender sends out a verification of rent, the landlord says, I don't, I'm not feeling out of this for. Well, why not? They don't, they just don't like sign in forms. And that is sad, but it happens. Then you have people who get child support. And they have an ex-husband whose jealous or upset that the person is buying a house. And the borrower says, I, I need you to give me a copy of your statements to prove that you've given me this hundred dollars a week all these years. And the guy says, I'm not giving you anything. Yeah, I'm still bitter about the divorce or whatever. That's right. And I'll give you another scenario. Your roommate from college, after you graduate, you get an apartment and you take turns paying rent. Every month, one of you plays half the rent. And then you part ways or what are you, you come in one day and you announce, guess what? I'm getting married and my, my fiance and I just bought a house. The roommate's just so happy for you, right? So the mortgage lender says, I need to have proof that the rent was paid on time the past 15 to 18 months, two years, whatever you got, give it to me. And the soon to be ex-room mates says, I'm not giving you a thing. And so yeah, you know, it's like these bridesmaid stories. You know, it's almost the same thing when people are buying a house. They expect that those people that are providing them with documentation are going to be cooperative, doesn't always happen. And the same thing happens when the property appraiser comes and finds something broken. And the seller was so nice, the seller offered you cookies every time you came by. Oh, you guys are going to love our house. We had so many happy members here, blah, blah, blah. And then when you find out that there's an electrical, it's $1,500 because electricity is illegal and needs to be brought up to grade. She slams dirt on the REALTOR's face, saying, call my lawyer. All right. You know, all of these things, motions can affect, make people lose deals. And so I guess I'm kind of giving you a lot of examples. When we're dealing with artificial intelligence, nothing is captured except the person's income. They're debt ratio, what they're paying for the house, the house location. It doesn't capture irregular income. It doesn't capture self-employment income. There are people working in farms and ranches and domestic households. There are people driving Uber by day and they're working at Home Depot at night. They've saved $40,000 to buy a house. And the lender is looking for wage documentation and your borrowers saying, it's in my phone. I get paid through Venmo. They don't have paystuffs for these jobs. And so this is what's falling through the cracks and hurting the home buying industry is that decision modeling systems are great for those people who have had the same job for five years. Have all their money in one bank. They have, you know, accredited scores that are high. Those are, I'm not going to say they're half the buyers in America or maybe 60 or 70 percent. But a third of America's are non-salary. And a lot of people are getting grants. They're getting job payment assistance, getting funds from their relatives. And your AI systems, the algorithm is only picking up the generic transactions. Okay, it's not picking up the prepaid points that are being paid by the seller. It's not picking up, you know, other incentives that may be included in the transaction. And so it's showing that you're short for closing funds. And then the AI system is spitting out a letter saying subject to sufficient funds to close no less than $7,100. And it was rolled into the mortgage. Right? And so all of these little things lead people in terms of bewilderment, distress. And unless they've locked in their raid and have a firm commitment, if there's a mortgage contingency, they will get their deposit back and then your deal dies. So the book, by the way, is closing the gap in home ownership, rewriting the rules against mortgage discrimination. I would love you have a chapter in your book on lost opportunities. Tell us what are these lost opportunities? And what can what can we do about them? I am so glad you brought that up because I'm fully forgot about it. It's one of my favorite chapters. I call it lost opportunities because, of course, the most important opportunity is the one that you can quantify. And that is the appreciation, the future appreciation of your home. But the opportunities that cannot be quantified is the fact that we have 80 million people in America that are renting an apartment buildings and their families are sick because indoor air quality. And so the United States Department of Energy did a study, the International Energy Association did a study. The tenants in these buildings have no control over their indoor air quality. So all of these harmful things are and bacteria are floating through and they're going from unit to unit. And so when people are able to get into their own home, they get healthier and they get happier. The other lost opportunity is the fact that we have a law that was passed two years ago called the Inflation Reduction Act. Just so you know, Kamala Harris was the architect behind that new law. And so let's just say that you buy a house and you do $30,000 worth of energy improvements such as solar panels. But you didn't take that $30,000 out of the bank, which you don't have probably. You got it at an interest-free loan from the state of Illinois. Okay. So then when you have a new HFAC system installed or you have your electrical upgrade or you get those sonopanels or you get a charging station for your electric car, whatever it is that you do. Up to 30% of what you spent is called a bottom line dollar for dollar tax credit. And so if you have, if you spend 30,000, you probably have eight to nine thousand dollars subtracted from whatever you own your taxes. Now that law is still in effect, it covers everything. Inflation, it covers energy inspections. Now the third lost opportunity I want to talk about is that according to Harvard University, there are you know, five and a half million people in America that are at risk to a weather-related disasters. As you know, we have hurricanes, we have flooding. Now I don't know about you, but people who live in an apartment building don't have their landlord's A. Oh, you don't have to pay your rent for six months because I know you have to clean up this. Sure. Water problem. But Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac simultaneously issued letters about a year and a half ago saying that any of their loans that are any mortgage in America that was sold to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, all mortgage services automatically have permission to put their payment on pause for a weather-related disaster. And so the mortgage service, so Fannie Mae's response recovery network has to verify what the terms and the situation is of the disaster. And so what the home buyer gets to do is they call someone on the phone, it's available in different languages, they explain the situation, their payments are put on paused, and depending on the severity of the situation, they could get their payments paused for 12 months, possibly 24 months. But listen to this, the counselors that are working is called project porch light. And so the people that are working for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and HUD are trained to help people with a financial disaster if somebody loses a job, somebody is sick at the household. The kid promises you, all right, we're going to put your loan in for a balance, but they will listen to everyone. And they actually help with processing the payments for flood insurance. They are trusted advocates. And so there isn't anyone that gets this kind of service, unless they are a homeowner, which is why I call it lost opportunities. I love that. And just sort of to wrap up, I'd love to know some action steps that you think our audience can REALTOR's can take to really help their assist their clients through this process and really close that home ownership gap. Okay. Well, in my book, I have a whole page to just when step by step instructions on how to Google your way through your city or town to find out what the town is giving back to its community. So real estate people are out there paving the pavement, boots on the ground, right? So whatever your so-called territory is, you go on the internet and you look up the housing divisions, you Google home biograms, but here's what you're going to find out. There's not only do most municipalities in America on a small basis, city, town, or county, parish, if you're in the South, certain states. What they do is they have incentives for people. And yes, sometimes they're limited by income, but you know, the income levels are pretty high. And a lot of people are qualified. But these cities and towns also have services for veterans. They have services, you know, free grants for building handicapped accessory units. You're going to learn about what the town gives back to its people when they're buying a house and after they live in it. And so I say start googling your way through what incentives are available for your customers. And also check out Freddie Mac DPA1, which stands for down payment assistance.1. And sometimes the information is limited to lenders, but you know, put up a big fight and say, look, I want this information. There are ways to find out ahead of time, especially on the Freddie Mac website. And you should find out in advance what down payment assistance is available. You do not have to have an offer in a house. You do not need a specific address for someone to come back and say, okay, now I can tell you whether or not it's available. That's not true. It also HUD has a directory. Yeah, I think that's really smart too. And then this also, really we're talking about REALTORS educating themselves on sort of non-traditional options that maybe apply to certain groups that maybe they haven't yet worked with or certain demographic people that fall into certain demographics or geographics. But there's also, you know, we're talking about kind of understanding the alternative options that exist. And again, I am technically an employee of my own company. But do I really understand, you know, lending with when somebody has an S corporation? Not really. So even I would have to, you know, I think this is a great opportunity to partner with the lender as well, who's well-versed in some of these, you know, grants. And really, you know, I think this is an opportunity to create education around I see people, agents successful REALTORS doing, you know, so you want to buy your first home kind of a webinar. And they partner with, with, you know, other experts. And you do seem at least here in Chicago. I go to some of these and I do see it seems to me to be a lot of minority people attending, people who maybe haven't purchased their first home. They seem to be super interested and asking a lot of questions. And it's really, it's really encouraging to see agents who are doing that because they're certainly, you know, and I appreciate also the consumer who's like, I want to learn, but they have to learn from somebody. And I think maybe becoming that knowledge source, or at least aligning yourself with those knowledge sources seems to be a really, really great idea. And I wanted to, I wanted to just, I would be remiss wrapping up, I wanted to ask you a little bit just, I know you could talk about this for probably a very long time, but any thoughts about the NAR settlement, not so much in whether you like it or not, but where do you think it's going to push our industry? Do you have any, any thoughts of, you know, what you think might be, what might start to happen as a result of some of the new changes? Well, it is not helping to close the home ownership gap because people are not going to start knocking on the door. It's like, can I buy your house? I mean, that's just not going to happen. I've seen a little bit, a little bit written on this. I think the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, FHA, and BA is 0% down, but I think that some allowances are going to be made for the bioprogram fee, whether it's the bioregion fee, I should say, whether it's 2%, 1.5% to 2.5% whatever that fee is, as long as it's disclosed, I have a feeling that it will be netted out from what the house needs to appraise at. You know, I think that there'll be a few adjustments that have to be made, but you know, I mean, you're familiar with the fact that when people get a mortgage with minimum down, I have to have two or three months payment reserves. That has always been a stretch for people. After $5,000 or $10,000 in the bank. But if you're buying a house of $400,000 and you're a bioregion fee, it is going to be $8,000. There's no way you're going to be able to afford the down payment, closing costs, reserves, and that fee. So I think what you're going to see is rolling it into the cost of the mortgage is one option. It's like financing the points. But I also think, you know, we're talking about a 50-50 MLS system that worked very nicely for 40 years. And out of nowhere, it's completely changed. And I know when I sold my house, I mean, my broker got a $60,000 condition because nobody was going to change the way they do anything where I live. And even though the house sold at an hour, there's no discounts, no open house, either nothing. So yeah, it was a full, it was a 5% or 6%. No, I can't remember. I think it was 5%. So I think that what you're going to see is that after a while, when I'm quoting technology here, the old IBM comment, when things don't work smoothly as was expected, after a while people go back to doing things the old way. Right? If it doesn't broke, it's not broken, don't fix it. I don't think that, I know it's a new rule going into place, but by gut feeling is that it's not going to be around forever. I think it's going to hurt the industry. I mean, I wrote the book, but everyone across the country is doing everything to help close the racial gap in homeownership. And this new rule is doing the opposite. It's certainly making it harder for lower income people to be able to afford their first home. It's not just that. It's the whole concept. It just doesn't really make any sense. I think that somebody in their evil mastermind thought that Redfin and Zillow and all of the online companies were going to be the primer, were going to disrupt the market, as digital disruption people, people go buy a home virtually. And we all know that hasn't really happened. Yeah. If you talk to some of praises, or real estate appraisal is almost like a, what do they call those personal descriptions on a dating site? Everybody is in great condition in their athletic and they work out on their gorgeous, while a real estate appraiser will write up the house the same way. And so, to have a virtual business for buying and selling is not always good. All right, well, the book, the book again, is closing the gap in homeownership, rewriting the rules against mortgage discrimination. It is available everywhere.
