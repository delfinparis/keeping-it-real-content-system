[00:01:15] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:19] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:22] Now, as a real estate recruiter,
[00:01:24] I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:27] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:30] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:32] Well, what if I were to tell you
[00:01:33] there's a recruiting and retention tool
[00:01:35] powered by artificial intelligence
[00:01:36] that shows you exactly which agents in your local market
[00:01:40] are looking to leave their brokerage right now
[00:01:43] and which agents at your own firm
[00:01:45] are also looking to leave you?
[00:01:47] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years
[00:01:50] and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:52] I can tell you with no exaggeration,
[00:01:55] this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:57] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables
[00:02:00] for each agent in your market
[00:02:02] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:05] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went
[00:02:08] and visited my recruiting website
[00:02:10] and read everything I offer.
[00:02:12] So now when I'm recruiting,
[00:02:13] corded's AI tells me exactly what to say
[00:02:16] based on that agent's needs
[00:02:18] and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:19] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:22] I've never seen anything like it
[00:02:23] and I use it every single day.
[00:02:26] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage,
[00:02:29] corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:31] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:34] That's corded.io and now onto the show.
[00:02:37] I'm going to go on the show.
[00:02:51] Welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real,
[00:02:54] the largest podcast made by real estate agents
[00:02:56] and for real estate agents.
[00:02:58] My name is DJ Paris.
[00:02:59] I'm your guide and host through the show.
[00:03:02] And today is our monthly series
[00:03:04] called Better Business with Ben.
[00:03:06] Who is Ben?
[00:03:07] Ben Lales is one of the top real estate agents
[00:03:10] in Chicago out of 46,000 agents.
[00:03:12] He's right at the top of the mountain.
[00:03:14] He has a team, the Ben Lales team with Compass
[00:03:16] and Ben comes on every single month
[00:03:18] to give us some really great tips
[00:03:21] of how you can scale your business, your team
[00:03:24] and just really any way to increase
[00:03:26] your overall production.
[00:03:28] Ben, welcome once again.
[00:03:29] Thank you, DJ.
[00:03:30] Let's give a pitch for your social media.
[00:03:33] Oh, thank you.
[00:03:33] Check out the Ben Lales team up.
[00:03:35] Instagram or you can find me on LinkedIn, benlales.com.
[00:03:41] Thank you.
[00:03:42] And kind.
[00:03:43] What I like about your website, benlales.com,
[00:03:46] is it is very intentional
[00:03:47] and you don't have any superfluous stuff in there.
[00:03:51] It's really all just here.
[00:03:53] And it's very minimal as well.
[00:03:55] So I encourage everyone to check it out.
[00:03:56] It's a very unique take on a REALTOR website.
[00:03:58] Yeah, I don't dilute myself
[00:04:00] into thinking someone's going to benlales.com
[00:04:02] to search for real estate.
[00:04:04] I feel like everyone's trying to win on search.
[00:04:06] Well, guess what, you already lost.
[00:04:08] Zillow has won.
[00:04:09] You're not going to beat Zillow.
[00:04:10] Yeah.
[00:04:11] Yeah, we beat Compass has one question mark, I don't know.
[00:04:13] Yeah, Compass has won and they probably get some traffic.
[00:04:16] They do.
[00:04:16] But if I wasn't Compass and I'm not,
[00:04:18] I don't know, Colble Banker,
[00:04:20] I'd probably not put the search on my website.
[00:04:22] Yeah, not needed.
[00:04:24] No, blog does well.
[00:04:25] Anyway, what are we going to talk about today?
[00:04:27] So I feel like the caption is keeping it real,
[00:04:31] podcast, better business with Ben,
[00:04:34] recognizing opportunity.
[00:04:35] Yeah, this is a big one.
[00:04:37] Right now we have so many agents that are struggling, right?
[00:04:39] We have low inventory.
[00:04:41] We've got high interest rates.
[00:04:43] We've got buyers sitting on the sidelines.
[00:04:45] We have people locked into 3% mortgages
[00:04:47] that they don't want to leave.
[00:04:49] So there's just not as much activity
[00:04:50] last year, 30 year low in real estate home sales.
[00:04:54] Although that's ticking up now, thankfully.
[00:04:56] So we were talking before and I kind of want to talk about,
[00:05:00] because ultimately what we're doing here is better business.
[00:05:03] What's the problem and then what is a potential solution?
[00:05:06] So the problem that I see with agents on my team,
[00:05:09] but globally is they'll be going
[00:05:13] about their ordinary course of business.
[00:05:16] And let's say I don't know.
[00:05:18] For me, it seems normal,
[00:05:19] but the opportunity is staring at,
[00:05:22] it's looking at people right in the face
[00:05:24] and they just don't see it.
[00:05:26] Right?
[00:05:26] And I, we'll start with some examples,
[00:05:29] but sometimes the opportunity is there.
[00:05:31] And agents are ignoring it.
[00:05:33] And I want to go through ways that people can see it
[00:05:37] and then capitalize on it because people don't know it's there.
[00:05:40] I have a great phrase for this.
[00:05:41] We're going to call it the elusive obvious.
[00:05:43] Elusive obvious.
[00:05:44] Yeah, I love it.
[00:05:46] So I'll give you an example of something that just happened.
[00:05:50] So we have a cold rental lead come in, right?
[00:05:57] Hey, I need to list my property for rent.
[00:06:01] Okay.
[00:06:02] On its surface, you do the CMA.
[00:06:05] And it was somewhere in the neighborhood of 3,600.
[00:06:09] Right, 3,600.
[00:06:10] I might make after splits, et cetera.
[00:06:13] I take home $3,000.
[00:06:14] That's a good day.
[00:06:15] Yeah, move on to the sunset, right?
[00:06:18] What do I mean, what comes to your head?
[00:06:21] So opportunities beyond the listing the rental
[00:06:23] and getting in the tenant.
[00:06:25] Yes.
[00:06:25] Well, I would assume this is probably an investment opportunity
[00:06:29] or rather an investor who might be interested
[00:06:32] in buying more condos or more units.
[00:06:34] Maybe.
[00:06:35] This person also doesn't live there,
[00:06:37] so they need to live somewhere else.
[00:06:38] So maybe they're moving.
[00:06:39] Right.
[00:06:40] What else?
[00:06:40] What else?
[00:06:42] Up.
[00:06:42] Well, all of the tenants that are applying
[00:06:44] have opportunity there to match them into other apartments.
[00:06:47] Yeah.
[00:06:48] So, you know, the first step always is,
[00:06:52] I think people need to ask more questions.
[00:06:56] So this person came in and, I don't,
[00:06:59] I'm trying to like not sound egotistical.
[00:07:01] This stuff is second nature to me,
[00:07:02] and I realize that it might not be second nature to everyone.
[00:07:05] But first thing is, okay, where are you going?
[00:07:10] And he says, I'm moving in with my girlfriend.
[00:07:13] Okay, great.
[00:07:14] And I'm gonna kind of take people
[00:07:17] through the whole arc of all of the questions.
[00:07:20] All right, great.
[00:07:21] So you obviously own this condo.
[00:07:23] Does your girlfriend own something?
[00:07:27] No, she's renting.
[00:07:28] Okay, well, great.
[00:07:29] Well, there's no real opportunity there yet.
[00:07:31] I'm like, okay, when is her to lease up?
[00:07:34] Oh, her to lease is up at, you know, it's up in May.
[00:07:37] I'm like, okay.
[00:07:39] Are you guys planning on staying?
[00:07:42] They're like, oh, I don't know.
[00:07:44] Well, first opportunity is, hey, if you need something,
[00:07:47] you know, I'm happy to help you guys find
[00:07:51] whatever it is you may need.
[00:07:53] Just because the girlfriend is currently renting
[00:07:58] does not necessarily mean she also doesn't own
[00:08:00] any property.
[00:08:01] Does she own anything?
[00:08:03] No, she doesn't.
[00:08:04] Okay, so, you know, at that point, I'm like, okay,
[00:08:06] maybe nothing is there.
[00:08:08] So I go ahead and I do, you know, my CMA,
[00:08:13] and, you know, I see what he purchased it for.
[00:08:16] And it's a really hot market.
[00:08:18] So whether or not he's interested in selling,
[00:08:24] you always, you, that's where I always start is, okay,
[00:08:29] this is how much your property would sell for in today's
[00:08:31] market.
[00:08:32] How long ago did he buy it?
[00:08:34] Like two and a half years.
[00:08:35] So the price has gone up.
[00:08:36] Price, yeah, so he bought it for like 505.
[00:08:39] Listen, he's not going to make a ton of money,
[00:08:40] but I'm like, you've probably sold this for 550 plus right now.
[00:08:44] That's a down payment for a new place.
[00:08:45] Do you want to do that?
[00:08:47] No, I don't.
[00:08:48] Okay, so I'm back to square one, just leasing his place.
[00:08:51] Then my, my head goes to how long have you been with this girl?
[00:08:56] Why marriage?
[00:08:58] Like, are you guys going to, I'm like, are you ring shopping?
[00:09:01] Like, what's the, what's the situation?
[00:09:03] And he's like, yeah, like, you know, we're getting really serious.
[00:09:06] I'm like, okay, when that time comes, are you going to be
[00:09:09] moving back into the place that I'm renting?
[00:09:12] And now I'm also, I'm accomplishing two things.
[00:09:13] One, I want to make sure that, you know, I don't lock this place up for two years
[00:09:18] if they're planning on moving back in.
[00:09:19] But if they're not, okay, cool.
[00:09:20] I have now I have a lead.
[00:09:22] That's my pipeline.
[00:09:23] Yeah, that's 2025.
[00:09:24] You were great lead.
[00:09:25] Yeah, 2026 pipeline.
[00:09:26] These people are probably getting married.
[00:09:28] When people get married, they typically want to find a new place together.
[00:09:31] Together, right?
[00:09:32] So then I have that.
[00:09:34] Okay, let's go back to the lease.
[00:09:35] So I do all of my research.
[00:09:37] And of course, you know, I plan to get tenants and place them if possible as, you know, I
[00:09:43] put it up on the market.
[00:09:44] But also he starts saying like, yeah, you know, in the building, you know, many of the
[00:09:52] people have been there for a long time.
[00:09:54] So then you ask the question, do you know of anyone looking to sell from the building?
[00:09:59] Right.
[00:10:00] Right.
[00:10:00] And listen, ultimately, what I truly believe is we will probably list this and get
[00:10:07] one tenant.
[00:10:08] But this is a small microcosm of the entire business.
[00:10:13] If you're having that one instance times 20 in a given week, month, whatever the case may
[00:10:18] be, you're going to find more and more opportunity.
[00:10:23] And I can't, I can't explain to you just how often I'll have this conversation with it,
[00:10:30] like a team member.
[00:10:32] And they haven't asked any questions.
[00:10:34] Right.
[00:10:35] And one of those opportunities is actually completely, fully baked.
[00:10:41] And they just don't, it's just there.
[00:10:44] They didn't ask the question.
[00:10:45] Take it.
[00:10:45] Take it like, oh, you're, you know, you're moving in with your girlfriend and she owns.
[00:10:51] Now you have, they're selling one of those.
[00:10:53] Yeah.
[00:10:54] For sure, right?
[00:10:55] They're either going to move in.
[00:10:56] So you have, you have to be ready to seize the opportunity when it comes.
[00:11:00] And I can go through other examples.
[00:11:02] But what it comes down to is everyone who's watching needs to ask.
[00:11:07] I don't know.
[00:11:09] Triple the amount of questions that they're asking right now.
[00:11:11] Yeah.
[00:11:12] You know, with that same example, what you could also do is now you're in that building.
[00:11:17] Now you have access.
[00:11:18] There's, is it a big building?
[00:11:19] Six units.
[00:11:20] Oh, perfect.
[00:11:21] You could write an individual letter to all six of the people, slide it under their door.
[00:11:25] If you want to or put it in their mailbox and say, just so you guys know, I'm renting
[00:11:29] this property for so and so.
[00:11:31] If you guys are interested in either renting or selling or just want to see what your place is worth
[00:11:35] for rental or for sale, I can just run that up for free for you.
[00:11:38] You know, it just does as a, you know, gratis thing.
[00:11:42] And there you go right there.
[00:11:43] I want to go through one other example.
[00:11:45] We have a listing in the Hancock right now.
[00:11:47] And we did this wild video.
[00:11:51] And our seller goes, you know, everyone is so unhappy.
[00:11:55] I should probably shouldn't say this.
[00:11:56] We're going to do it anyway.
[00:11:57] Many of the people are unhappy with the representation in the building because there's, you know,
[00:12:02] X number of people who dominate in the building.
[00:12:04] Right.
[00:12:04] So you're talking about there's REALTOR who,
[00:12:06] REALTORS who may even live in the building or who really just focus on the Hancock building.
[00:12:11] They become kind of the go to person.
[00:12:13] I would argue that many people will be like, oh, okay, that's interesting and move on with their lives.
[00:12:19] For us, we recognize an opportunity to, you know, make sure that everyone knows just the level of marketing that we're doing.
[00:12:26] So, you know, we first of all, the simplest thing is to ask, hey, do you know anyone else who is selling?
[00:12:35] We love to help them.
[00:12:36] And I think I've probably come a little, become a little immune to like the anxiety that that may provoke in others.
[00:12:45] But asking the question, like, who's who's thinking about selling?
[00:12:48] We would love to help them.
[00:12:49] That question is enough.
[00:12:50] But if not, you know, we're already fliring the entire building and have a QR code to the video that we're doing.
[00:12:58] We can maybe queue it.
[00:13:00] You can pull it up.
[00:13:01] It's I dive into the pool in my purple suit.
[00:13:04] I've seen it.
[00:13:04] Oh, you did see it.
[00:13:05] It's a great video.
[00:13:05] Yeah.
[00:13:06] So that's for the Hancock.
[00:13:07] Yeah.
[00:13:08] Okay.
[00:13:08] So I, this is a great commercial.
[00:13:10] We will put a link to that commercial.
[00:13:12] And well, commercial isn't really the right word, but short form video.
[00:13:14] We'll put that in because that is an, I was shocked when I saw that.
[00:13:18] You dove in with a full suit into a pool.
[00:13:19] Yeah, Zach was Zach's off screen, but we, so we were there and in slow motion, by the way.
[00:13:25] Yeah, I actually dove in slow motion.
[00:13:27] That wasn't a incredible.
[00:13:29] That wasn't a trick of the video.
[00:13:30] But I was standing there and I'm like, you know, trying to get just get a video.
[00:13:36] I didn't plan on it.
[00:13:37] And I'm like, I'm here.
[00:13:38] I'm going to suit.
[00:13:38] I have a change of clothes.
[00:13:41] And I think maybe within three minutes of making the like the decision.
[00:13:44] I was I was in the water.
[00:13:46] But like also, you know, that's opportunity to literally do something that people aren't
[00:13:52] willing to do and capture it on camera is opportunity.
[00:13:56] And then you could also post you obviously you've already posted it on a social.
[00:13:59] You can tag the handcock in it.
[00:14:01] You can, you know, hashtag it up and do all sorts of things.
[00:14:05] Yeah.
[00:14:06] So, but getting back to the, you know, I really am cautious of people's time here.
[00:14:12] And thank you for bringing me on.
[00:14:13] I really want to try to bring as much value as humanly possible in like the 10 minutes
[00:14:17] that we have people's attention is, you know, DJ, you actually brought this up when we
[00:14:23] were, you know, talking pre-shoot here is, you know, what I would challenge everyone
[00:14:30] who's watching to do right now is take a look at the last 10 opportunities that have come
[00:14:37] their way and really do a deep dive into how the opportunity actually came about.
[00:14:44] And to your point, try to duplicate that.
[00:14:47] So I'll give you an example.
[00:14:49] Like if you, you know, you're touring with a buyer and it came from a referral.
[00:14:56] The referral source may be your sister, your brother, your friend.
[00:15:00] But from there, where were you?
[00:15:03] What happened that was the catalyst to have the friends say, Hey, DJ, Hey, Ben,
[00:15:11] you should really talk to Kim.
[00:15:13] Yeah.
[00:15:14] Let's say it was a dinner party.
[00:15:15] Yeah.
[00:15:16] So it's like, okay, you don't, you might not recognize that you have a real opportunity to
[00:15:21] double triple quadruple the amount of dinner parties you go to or host.
[00:15:25] Yeah, or host them.
[00:15:26] Yeah.
[00:15:26] Because that's when those opportunities come about and the opportunities are hidden,
[00:15:30] I think where you may hear someone say, like, Oh, my friend got a new job.
[00:15:36] Oh, my friend is moving to Cincinnati or whatever the case may be.
[00:15:42] And there's your opportunity.
[00:15:43] And I actually wanted to talk about this in particular job transfer.
[00:15:48] If I told you that my sister just got a job transfer to Cincinnati,
[00:15:55] you're a real estate agent.
[00:15:56] What should you be thinking?
[00:15:58] I'm going to find the best real estate agent in Cincinnati and call them and say,
[00:16:01] how would you like a free lead?
[00:16:02] Right.
[00:16:03] And I'm making the assertion and, you know, I'm happy for people to jump in the comments,
[00:16:08] be like, of course, you idiot.
[00:16:09] Everyone does.
[00:16:10] Everyone knows that.
[00:16:10] No, no, they don't know.
[00:16:11] They don't.
[00:16:12] That and that's, that's my belief.
[00:16:13] And I think that referral income is like really low hanging fruit that people
[00:16:20] don't recognize.
[00:16:21] And it goes both ways.
[00:16:22] Let's say that example that we just gave you someone's moving to town.
[00:16:27] People are so excited to have, you know, received the lead that, you know,
[00:16:32] they just get into, okay, let's go out and tour property.
[00:16:35] Let me understand your criteria.
[00:16:36] Let me put you a touch.
[00:16:37] There's so much to do.
[00:16:38] Let me put you in touch with the lender and let me get you set up on our search platform.
[00:16:42] But if they're moving here, what's your situation over there?
[00:16:47] Right.
[00:16:48] And my favorite income in the entire business is referral.
[00:16:51] Sure.
[00:16:52] You know, let me negotiate my, you know, referral fees are getting higher and higher.
[00:16:55] They were 25 or 20 when I started and now you can get up to 35 and nobody bats
[00:16:59] and I.
[00:16:59] Yeah.
[00:17:00] Well, if they're moving from Cincinnati, oh, you own in Cincinnati.
[00:17:05] Well, let me do, like I have gone as far as, let me do the research for you.
[00:17:09] Right.
[00:17:10] It's different when a consumer with limited knowledge goes and explores a real estate
[00:17:14] agent.
[00:17:15] I'll do it for you.
[00:17:16] And you know how to interview the agent.
[00:17:18] You know what you're looking for.
[00:17:19] And you know how to develop the relationship.
[00:17:21] And when you talk to that agent, because hey, by the way, I expect you to in a,
[00:17:25] in a cute way, you can sort of say it, but I expect you to be doing,
[00:17:28] but let's do this all the time for each other.
[00:17:29] Exactly.
[00:17:30] So then it extends one step further.
[00:17:32] Hey, I don't know how often you have people moving from Cincinnati to Chicago,
[00:17:35] but then you develop another relationship.
[00:17:37] And again, it comes, you know, comes down to, I just gave you three examples.
[00:17:41] One, the, uh, listing, the rental listing is right over here in Wicker Park,
[00:17:47] the Hancock and this Cincinnati thing.
[00:17:51] They add up, you have a 10% chance here, a 10% chance here, a 10% chance here.
[00:17:56] But people just aren't doing it and they're not doing it with a level of consistency,
[00:17:59] recognizing that there's, there might be more to, you know, the business that's
[00:18:04] just staring at them right in the face.
[00:18:05] Well, in the referral example is really powerful because you're not,
[00:18:09] you're no longer trading hours for dollars.
[00:18:11] Like you are literally handing it off, hoping for the best and just going to get a
[00:18:15] check if it, if it's back to closes and you knock out enough of those,
[00:18:19] you'll just get, you'll just hammer checks all the time.
[00:18:21] Yeah, there's, there's many, many agents that I am familiar with who,
[00:18:27] like that's their whole job.
[00:18:28] I know, I've had them on my show.
[00:18:30] The, I know agents that are YouTubers that all they do is put out content that
[00:18:34] people who are looking to buy or sell in a particular area, you know,
[00:18:37] they do certain neighborhoods, they talk about restaurants, they do not leave their
[00:18:41] office. They do not show homes, they do not work with clients.
[00:18:44] All they do is they pick a city, they pretend that they live there and they do
[00:18:48] content. And then when they get those leads, they just pass them off.
[00:18:51] Yeah. So, you know, I'm interested in like your experience when you're
[00:18:56] talking to, I mean, you have how many agents at Kale 700 plus 700 plus agents.
[00:19:02] And my again, assertion is that I don't know how many of them are doing
[00:19:07] over 10 transactions a year, not as many as I'd like.
[00:19:10] Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:11] And I'm making the argument that the people who are doing like under 10
[00:19:15] transactions, doing five, six, seven transactions, they are ignoring
[00:19:19] opportunity that is staring at them right in the face.
[00:19:22] And I can only tell you from my experience that it took, it took longer
[00:19:28] than you may think to understand that the opportunity is there.
[00:19:34] And without at this point, I'm almost not interested in the business that's
[00:19:42] there, like the seller and the buyer because the job is done.
[00:19:45] Whatever I had done in the past, you already know how to do that.
[00:19:47] Yeah, it's here.
[00:19:49] Okay, how can I maximize my profits by thinking one step, two steps, three
[00:19:56] steps further, asking all of the relevant questions and making, you know,
[00:20:02] there's a huge difference between one client and two clients.
[00:20:06] If I can turn every client into, you know, 50% more business, well,
[00:20:10] I'm probably going to have a successful career.
[00:20:13] Yeah, and this also brings up the opportunity to for referrals to other industries,
[00:20:17] right?
[00:20:18] So are other other ancillary stuff.
[00:20:20] So who's your state planning attorney?
[00:20:21] Oh, you don't have a will.
[00:20:22] We need to get that just set up for you.
[00:20:24] Call my guy or, you know, how, how about account?
[00:20:27] Do you have an account?
[00:20:28] I've got the best one.
[00:20:29] You know, things like that where you can set up these referral, reciprocal
[00:20:32] referral relationships and just get business all day.
[00:20:35] Yeah.
[00:20:35] And, you know, I don't actually think it is confined to sales.
[00:20:43] I think it's also relevant to talk about the, because ultimately what we're
[00:20:49] talking about is opportunity that extends outside of a transaction.
[00:20:54] And I want to use like kind of this as the example sitting here with you.
[00:20:59] I'm not sure where any of this is going to lead.
[00:21:02] But, you know, you have to put yourself out there because you believe that there
[00:21:07] is like reciprocal, not reciprocal additional opportunity.
[00:21:12] I believe that this may lead to referral partnerships with agents who are watching.
[00:21:20] I believe that agents may join my team because of this.
[00:21:24] And you have to be ready to have the DJ.
[00:21:27] If someone, I'm asking you right now, if an agent reaches out,
[00:21:30] can you please put them in touch with me?
[00:21:32] Yeah.
[00:21:33] Yeah.
[00:21:33] Right.
[00:21:34] And you have to have the guts to actually ask that question so that it
[00:21:38] actually happens as opposed to, you know, crossing your fingers and hoping.
[00:21:44] And in fact, Jay's goodwill.
[00:21:45] We do have a relationship like that because Ben has said, because I recruit for
[00:21:48] for kale and Ben has said, Hey, if you have somebody that's not a fit for kale,
[00:21:52] but would be a fit for my team, can you pass them over to me?
[00:21:55] And I'm like, well, sure, why wouldn't I?
[00:21:57] Yeah.
[00:21:57] What you actually said was, sure, what will you,
[00:22:00] and there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:22:02] Like what what's in it for me?
[00:22:03] I'm like, I love this.
[00:22:04] Yeah.
[00:22:04] It's two business people trying to do right by each other.
[00:22:07] Yeah.
[00:22:07] And that's how it goes.
[00:22:09] But that's the opportunity that is sitting right.
[00:22:12] The obvious, I know you're recruit.
[00:22:14] You know, I'm hiring.
[00:22:15] All right.
[00:22:16] Cool.
[00:22:17] Let's make something happen.
[00:22:18] Yeah.
[00:22:19] Yeah.
[00:22:20] I also want to give one little tip that I think is a really fun way about
[00:22:23] do going back to duplicating a client.
[00:22:25] So I'm going to ask you, we'll go through this exercise.
[00:22:27] Just take some minute.
[00:22:28] And I encourage everybody to go through this as we're going through it with Ben,
[00:22:32] sort of think about these answers on your own, because we're going to give you a strategy here that will absolutely work.
[00:22:36] So I want you to think of, we're not going to use their name.
[00:22:39] We'll call them, well, depending on what their gender is, we'll call them John or Sally.
[00:22:44] Think of an client that you really liked working with and you wished if you could duplicate that client,
[00:22:50] and that could be the one that you work with mostly.
[00:22:53] People like that.
[00:22:54] That that would be a great business for you.
[00:22:55] John.
[00:22:56] John.
[00:22:56] Okay.
[00:22:56] What does John do for a living?
[00:22:59] He's a consultant.
[00:23:00] He's a consultant.
[00:23:00] Perfect.
[00:23:01] Okay.
[00:23:01] So here's what you do.
[00:23:02] We now know John, we do you want to work with more consultants?
[00:23:05] Yeah.
[00:23:06] Okay.
[00:23:06] And do you know pretty much what they want and what they need?
[00:23:09] Oh, for sure.
[00:23:10] Okay.
[00:23:10] Great.
[00:23:10] And even if you said no, then you could call John and say, Hey, I want to work with more consultants.
[00:23:14] What do they want?
[00:23:14] And okay.
[00:23:15] So now you call John and you say, Hey, John, I am working on my marketing plan for this year.
[00:23:20] I would love to get your advice.
[00:23:22] By the way, he's a consultant.
[00:23:23] He gives advice.
[00:23:24] He loves that too.
[00:23:25] You do this with anybody.
[00:23:25] But consultants love doing this.
[00:23:27] I would love to get your advice on something.
[00:23:29] Can I swing by your office for five minutes or can I meet you for a cup of coffee?
[00:23:34] Five minutes is all I need.
[00:23:35] So what you're doing is you're asking for their advice.
[00:23:38] When people ask for advice, it is very flattering.
[00:23:41] It is, it is boost their ego.
[00:23:43] It makes them feel good.
[00:23:45] And you're not selling them anything.
[00:23:46] You're literally asking for help.
[00:23:48] So you say, Hey, John, I want to meet you up for coffee for five minutes.
[00:23:51] I just want to run this idea by you, get your thoughts on it.
[00:23:53] Let me know what you think or you know, do you have time?
[00:23:55] Okay.
[00:23:55] Great.
[00:23:55] Meet him for coffee.
[00:23:56] You're going to ask John two questions.
[00:23:58] The first is, Hey, John, I loved working with you so much.
[00:24:02] And I realized there are lots of consultants here in Chicago.
[00:24:06] I don't really, first of all, I want to work with more consultants.
[00:24:09] First question is, do you think that's a good idea?
[00:24:12] He's going to say, yes.
[00:24:14] And if he says no, then you go, well, why not?
[00:24:15] But he's going to say yes.
[00:24:17] Say, sure.
[00:24:17] Yeah.
[00:24:17] Why not?
[00:24:18] Then second question is great.
[00:24:20] If you were me, how might you get in front of more consultants?
[00:24:25] And you shut up and he will tell you, oh, we belong to this group or we have
[00:24:29] this meetings or I'll introduce you to some friends of mine or swing by the
[00:24:32] office and I'll introduce it's literally that simple.
[00:24:36] And I'm telling you, it works.
[00:24:38] So again, the two steps are to duplicate your client, call them up and say, Hey,
[00:24:43] or three steps rather.
[00:24:44] I want to take just a couple of minutes of your time.
[00:24:47] I've got this marketing idea.
[00:24:48] I want to run it by you and get your advice.
[00:24:50] I really think you'd help me.
[00:24:51] You'd be able to help me with this.
[00:24:52] Great.
[00:24:53] Okay.
[00:24:53] Meet him.
[00:24:53] Hey, I want to work with more X just like you, more doctors, more lawyers,
[00:24:57] more teachers, more nurses, whatever, just like you.
[00:25:01] Do you think that's a good idea?
[00:25:02] It is great.
[00:25:03] Hey, if you were me, how might you go about doing it?
[00:25:06] And then you shut up.
[00:25:07] And I'm telling you if you do this once a week, you will have so much business,
[00:25:11] so many people, people, what people will ultimately do is they will go, Oh,
[00:25:16] I work at a, there's a hundred accounts at my firm.
[00:25:19] Why don't I get in touch with the human resources person home buyer seminar?
[00:25:22] Yeah.
[00:25:22] Home buyer seminar.
[00:25:23] Yeah.
[00:25:24] That's what we do all the time.
[00:25:25] So smart.
[00:25:26] So what we will do and recognize opportunities like we keep on, you know,
[00:25:32] doing business with people.
[00:25:34] Oh, I can, this has happened.
[00:25:36] So like we've done home buyer seminars with the bulls Pepsi.
[00:25:42] We're about to do one with a whirlpool.
[00:25:44] And you just, it's not hard.
[00:25:46] Like they have, they're emailing you from their Pepsi account or from their world
[00:25:49] pro account.
[00:25:50] Hey, would it be useful to you?
[00:25:53] If I came in and did a home buyer seminar, because then you're also providing
[00:25:56] value, they get the opportunity to show their company that, you know,
[00:26:01] they're in for the long haul and that they're looking out for the company as a whole
[00:26:04] and their benefit.
[00:26:05] And you get to provide value that way too.
[00:26:07] And yeah, it's again, an exercise in.
[00:26:12] Where is the opportunity?
[00:26:14] And then I would add an element to your, you know, your speech with the consultant
[00:26:18] is, how can you provide value to them?
[00:26:21] And it's like the law of reciprocity.
[00:26:23] Yeah.
[00:26:24] Yeah, that's another thing is how can I help you in your business?
[00:26:26] So that would be maybe the third question to ask is how can I help you?
[00:26:30] And most of the time people say, I'm good.
[00:26:32] But if they eat something, maybe you can help them.
[00:26:34] And, you know, if you're an agent who is, you know, running a team, for example,
[00:26:41] forget about listings and buyers.
[00:26:46] The opportunity for like recruiting agents is not always staring at you in the face.
[00:26:54] I'll, I'm going to give you an example of a few agents who've had tremendous success on my team.
[00:27:00] They started as clients and they say something to you like, do you like being a real estate agent?
[00:27:05] I'm like, yeah, I do.
[00:27:07] I can leave it there.
[00:27:08] Right?
[00:27:08] Or you could say, why?
[00:27:11] I've been thinking about getting my license.
[00:27:12] Like, then you know that I'm at this point.
[00:27:16] You really should.
[00:27:17] And, you know, you can come work under me.
[00:27:20] We've had, I've had more than, I mean, an interesting amount of people have started their career with me that way.
[00:27:25] Or if you are out on a showing and I'm not advocating for poaching any agents.
[00:27:32] But an agent is saying they're having a really tough time and they're a solo agent.
[00:27:35] They're not on the team.
[00:27:37] Cool.
[00:27:38] How about, you know, you come in for an interview, see if maybe there's something there.
[00:27:42] Maybe there's not.
[00:27:43] But there's opportunity.
[00:27:44] Yeah.
[00:27:45] Everywhere.
[00:27:46] We have found that.
[00:27:49] You know, a lot of people have their licenses and they, they're just not doing anything with them.
[00:27:54] And it's just a side and they're really, really talented.
[00:27:56] Well, hey, like, why don't we cultivate that together?
[00:28:01] Yeah, we, we own a holding company, which is for agents that aren't actively practicing.
[00:28:05] But they just want to keep their license and good standing with the state.
[00:28:07] They have other jobs where they've retired.
[00:28:10] They're just not, you know, actively working with clients.
[00:28:12] They don't pay MLS dues.
[00:28:13] They're just want their license to sit somewhere.
[00:28:15] So what's great about that is we tell them, yeah, we'll hold it for, you know, problem.
[00:28:19] But did you know you can still earn referral commissions along the way?
[00:28:22] So everything that you really said today can still apply even to agents that aren't actively practicing.
[00:28:28] Because you can still find opportunity and then refer it out to anyone you want.
[00:28:31] Yeah.
[00:28:32] And I'll just add one other point.
[00:28:34] I'm just like, okay, how can you make an extra few bucks?
[00:28:37] Is, did you know that locksmiths will pay referral fees?
[00:28:41] Did you know that moving companies will pay referral fees?
[00:28:44] General contractors closet, you know, closet people, you know, real estate agents out of the, have you heard the cliche that we're the center of the referral economy?
[00:28:53] Yeah.
[00:28:54] Well, you shouldn't be doing these things in my opinion, like for free.
[00:28:59] Right?
[00:29:00] Like so go and talk to your, you know, your favorite mover, your favorite handyman and just be like, listen, I'm going to give, I'm going to refer everyone to you.
[00:29:12] And maybe as simple as like when I move, I expect you to do my move for free.
[00:29:16] Yeah.
[00:29:16] It's reasonable.
[00:29:17] Yeah, somebody like that.
[00:29:18] I want to earn it.
[00:29:19] Yeah.
[00:29:19] And it doesn't have to be anything crazy.
[00:29:21] But there's opportunities are limitless and people need to recognize them.
[00:29:26] I agree.
[00:29:27] And I would just throw in one idea that occurred to me when we were talking about one of your examples about somebody getting married.
[00:29:32] I'd also start chatting with wedding planners.
[00:29:34] Yeah.
[00:29:35] Great idea.
[00:29:36] So I'll give you something.
[00:29:37] When I was shopping for my ring, it's a close friend, Shara, Hakimi and Jim imports, Hakimi, Jim imports.
[00:29:48] I was like, hey, like when people are getting married, I'm sure they're looking for a place.
[00:29:53] So I brought him a, I think it was like 16, a couple of a case of who I'm like, I want you.
[00:30:02] If I put my business card on all of them, every time someone gives you the final check, you grab a bottle of food and you put it, this is for my real estate agent, give him a call.
[00:30:11] It did not work DJ.
[00:30:13] So don't do that.
[00:30:14] But it's worth a try.
[00:30:16] It's definitely worth a try.
[00:30:18] And you know, or with when you're talking to your financial advisor, your accountant, hey, they're talking to the people that you want to be talking to every single day, but it's not going to happen unless you open your mouth.
[00:30:27] And that's what this all comes down to, unless you open your mouth, you're willing to put yourself out there and ask for the opportunity.
[00:30:32] And I think it could both like that's what this all boils down to is you don't get what you don't ask for.
[00:30:39] Ask for the opportunity.
[00:30:41] Ask the question and you'd be surprised once you're comfortable asking it 20, 50, 100 times.
[00:30:48] I promise it's going to end up working out in your favor.
[00:30:51] Yeah, especially if it's past client, they like you.
[00:30:54] They want to help you.
[00:30:56] And you also should be chatting with them anyway to keep the relationship strong.
[00:30:59] And also you should be knowing what's going on in their lives.
[00:31:02] And hey, do you have any friends that are, you know, going through a life transition right now?
[00:31:05] I mean, we know 58% of marriages end in divorce, right?
[00:31:08] So that's another thing to keep in mind is divorce attorneys, right?
[00:31:11] We've been getting again, lots of opportunity out there.
[00:31:13] You just have to think about beyond your existing problem of I don't have enough leads.
[00:31:19] I don't have enough business.
[00:31:20] There's not a lot, not enough homes for sale in my area.
[00:31:23] I have all these buyers that don't, you know, yes, those are problems.
[00:31:26] And there's not an easy way to solve that.
[00:31:28] But there is always an easy way to find other opportunities.
[00:31:31] You just have to think outside of the problem.
[00:31:33] Every interaction that people have today, there is, I don't know if it's small or large,
[00:31:39] but there is an additional opportunity to be had.
[00:31:41] That's, I know that for certain, yeah, at this point, right?
[00:31:46] And I'll give you an example today, we get any lead that we get.
[00:31:51] We do research on them, you know, kind of immediately.
[00:31:54] The first thing you should be doing is understanding if they own something.
[00:31:58] And just start there.
[00:31:59] Do they own like a buyer comes in, you know,
[00:32:03] 90% of the time they're not going to be owning something, but they might.
[00:32:06] And you'd be surprised that they may own something in another, you know, another city.
[00:32:12] Just start there.
[00:32:14] But then you need to be asking questions, hey, do you own any other property?
[00:32:18] Are you looking to buy any other property?
[00:32:20] Are you moving?
[00:32:21] Do you need a referral for this or that?
[00:32:23] And that's like the basics, but it's one of those things.
[00:32:28] So me and my sales director, David Fields.
[00:32:31] We, we're actually not sure, DJ, if this is something that can be learned.
[00:32:36] Or if it's just in people, right?
[00:32:39] I don't know if this can be taught.
[00:32:40] What do you think?
[00:32:42] I think you can be taught.
[00:32:43] I think it's a skill.
[00:32:44] So I, but it requires somebody to practice.
[00:32:48] And so I think this goes back to putting in the time, putting in the reps, asking a lot of questions.
[00:32:53] And this gives you a reason to pick up the phone.
[00:32:56] It gives you a reason to send a text or make a video message.
[00:33:00] You know, these are the things you can always reach out to instead of just saying, hey,
[00:33:03] you're going to buy yourself your home this year next year.
[00:33:05] You can ask all sorts of other questions tangentially related to real estate or not.
[00:33:10] And continue the conversation and find those little modicums of opportunity.
[00:33:14] Yeah, I think we've probably beat a dead horse at this point.
[00:33:17] Agreed.
[00:33:17] Yeah, but recognize opportunity with Ben and DJ.
[00:33:21] I love it.
[00:33:22] I love it.
[00:33:23] So if you didn't get a lot out of this, this conversation, then you go back and relisten
[00:33:28] because there was a lot of Ben gave unbelievable examples of exactly what he and his team are doing
[00:33:33] to find opportunity that isn't so obviously sitting in front of you again, that elusive obvious
[00:33:38] when you, you uncover it through questioning.
[00:33:41] So it's there.
[00:33:42] You just have to have a process and you systematize everything.
[00:33:46] So that's another thing we should talk about in a future episode is exactly how to systematize your business
[00:33:52] so that you're not thinking about what do I need to do next.
[00:33:55] You have a process for what I need to do next.
[00:33:58] And therefore you can track it.
[00:33:59] You can, you can see, look at the metrics.
[00:34:02] You can see how effective it is and then make improvements.
[00:34:04] If you don't have those metrics, you're sort of flying blind, right?
[00:34:08] Or you don't have those systems, you're flying blind.
[00:34:09] So we're going to talk about that in a future episode right now for everyone.
[00:34:13] Follow Ben Lala's on Instagram.
[00:34:15] What's your Instagram account?
[00:34:16] The Ben Lala's team.
[00:34:17] BenLala's.com as well to see his team.
[00:34:20] And by the way, what are you looking for in a team member?
[00:34:23] You know, our, we're in flux right now.
[00:34:26] We're looking for just great humans, great human beings that have some sales experience.
[00:34:32] I want to go to the next level.
[00:34:33] But we're looking for people who are just good and they're people that are coachable.
[00:34:41] Coachable, certainly.
[00:34:42] And I think that goes to people who give, want to give not only to us,
[00:34:47] but to their clients more value than they receive.
[00:34:51] People who, you know, have a wee over me attitude.
[00:34:55] People who are doing this for the right reason, not only a paycheck.
[00:34:59] We're going to make people a lot of money.
[00:35:01] But honestly, DJ, we just want to be around good people who work hard.
[00:35:06] And, you know, we have the framework and the leads to, you know, take them to the next level.
[00:35:11] But unless they have like the soft skills or not, you know, we're not that interested right now.
[00:35:15] Love it.

And now, onto our show. Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io. Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team? Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes. But most agents aren't looking to move right now. So how do you know who to contact? Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking to leave you? Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents. I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for. Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move. Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and read everything I offer. So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes emails for me. I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day. Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there. Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again. That's corded.io and now onto the show. I'm going to go on the show. Welcome to another episode of Keeping It Real, the largest podcast made by real estate agents and for real estate agents. My name is DJ Paris. I'm your guide and host through the show. And today is our monthly series called Better Business with Ben. Who is Ben? Ben Lales is one of the top real estate agents in Chicago out of 46,000 agents. He's right at the top of the mountain. He has a team, the Ben Lales team with Compass and Ben comes on every single month to give us some really great tips of how you can scale your business, your team and just really any way to increase your overall production. Ben, welcome once again. Thank you, DJ. Let's give a pitch for your social media. Oh, thank you. Check out the Ben Lales team up. Instagram or you can find me on LinkedIn, benlales.com. Thank you. And kind. What I like about your website, benlales.com, is it is very intentional and you don't have any superfluous stuff in there. It's really all just here. And it's very minimal as well. So I encourage everyone to check it out. It's a very unique take on a REALTOR website. Yeah, I don't dilute myself into thinking someone's going to benlales.com to search for real estate. I feel like everyone's trying to win on search. Well, guess what, you already lost. Zillow has won. You're not going to beat Zillow. Yeah. Yeah, we beat Compass has one question mark, I don't know. Yeah, Compass has won and they probably get some traffic. They do. But if I wasn't Compass and I'm not, I don't know, Colble Banker, I'd probably not put the search on my website. Yeah, not needed. No, blog does well. Anyway, what are we going to talk about today? So I feel like the caption is keeping it real, podcast, better business with Ben, recognizing opportunity. Yeah, this is a big one. Right now we have so many agents that are struggling, right? We have low inventory. We've got high interest rates. We've got buyers sitting on the sidelines. We have people locked into 3% mortgages that they don't want to leave. So there's just not as much activity last year, 30 year low in real estate home sales. Although that's ticking up now, thankfully. So we were talking before and I kind of want to talk about, because ultimately what we're doing here is better business. What's the problem and then what is a potential solution? So the problem that I see with agents on my team, but globally is they'll be going about their ordinary course of business. And let's say I don't know. For me, it seems normal, but the opportunity is staring at, it's looking at people right in the face and they just don't see it. Right? And I, we'll start with some examples, but sometimes the opportunity is there. And agents are ignoring it. And I want to go through ways that people can see it and then capitalize on it because people don't know it's there. I have a great phrase for this. We're going to call it the elusive obvious. Elusive obvious. Yeah, I love it. So I'll give you an example of something that just happened. So we have a cold rental lead come in, right? Hey, I need to list my property for rent. Okay. On its surface, you do the CMA. And it was somewhere in the neighborhood of 3,600. Right, 3,600. I might make after splits, et cetera. I take home $3,000. That's a good day. Yeah, move on to the sunset, right? What do I mean, what comes to your head? So opportunities beyond the listing the rental and getting in the tenant. Yes. Well, I would assume this is probably an investment opportunity or rather an investor who might be interested in buying more condos or more units. Maybe. This person also doesn't live there, so they need to live somewhere else. So maybe they're moving. Right. What else? What else? Up. Well, all of the tenants that are applying have opportunity there to match them into other apartments. Yeah. So, you know, the first step always is, I think people need to ask more questions. So this person came in and, I don't, I'm trying to like not sound egotistical. This stuff is second nature to me, and I realize that it might not be second nature to everyone. But first thing is, okay, where are you going? And he says, I'm moving in with my girlfriend. Okay, great. And I'm gonna kind of take people through the whole arc of all of the questions. All right, great. So you obviously own this condo. Does your girlfriend own something? No, she's renting. Okay, well, great. Well, there's no real opportunity there yet. I'm like, okay, when is her to lease up? Oh, her to lease is up at, you know, it's up in May. I'm like, okay. Are you guys planning on staying? They're like, oh, I don't know. Well, first opportunity is, hey, if you need something, you know, I'm happy to help you guys find whatever it is you may need. Just because the girlfriend is currently renting does not necessarily mean she also doesn't own any property. Does she own anything? No, she doesn't. Okay, so, you know, at that point, I'm like, okay, maybe nothing is there. So I go ahead and I do, you know, my CMA, and, you know, I see what he purchased it for. And it's a really hot market. So whether or not he's interested in selling, you always, you, that's where I always start is, okay, this is how much your property would sell for in today's market. How long ago did he buy it? Like two and a half years. So the price has gone up. Price, yeah, so he bought it for like 505. Listen, he's not going to make a ton of money, but I'm like, you've probably sold this for 550 plus right now. That's a down payment for a new place. Do you want to do that? No, I don't. Okay, so I'm back to square one, just leasing his place. Then my, my head goes to how long have you been with this girl? Why marriage? Like, are you guys going to, I'm like, are you ring shopping? Like, what's the, what's the situation? And he's like, yeah, like, you know, we're getting really serious. I'm like, okay, when that time comes, are you going to be moving back into the place that I'm renting? And now I'm also, I'm accomplishing two things. One, I want to make sure that, you know, I don't lock this place up for two years if they're planning on moving back in. But if they're not, okay, cool. I have now I have a lead. That's my pipeline. Yeah, that's 2025. You were great lead. Yeah, 2026 pipeline. These people are probably getting married. When people get married, they typically want to find a new place together. Together, right? So then I have that. Okay, let's go back to the lease. So I do all of my research. And of course, you know, I plan to get tenants and place them if possible as, you know, I put it up on the market. But also he starts saying like, yeah, you know, in the building, you know, many of the people have been there for a long time. So then you ask the question, do you know of anyone looking to sell from the building? Right. Right. And listen, ultimately, what I truly believe is we will probably list this and get one tenant. But this is a small microcosm of the entire business. If you're having that one instance times 20 in a given week, month, whatever the case may be, you're going to find more and more opportunity. And I can't, I can't explain to you just how often I'll have this conversation with it, like a team member. And they haven't asked any questions. Right. And one of those opportunities is actually completely, fully baked. And they just don't, it's just there. They didn't ask the question. Take it. Take it like, oh, you're, you know, you're moving in with your girlfriend and she owns. Now you have, they're selling one of those. Yeah. For sure, right? They're either going to move in. So you have, you have to be ready to seize the opportunity when it comes. And I can go through other examples. But what it comes down to is everyone who's watching needs to ask. I don't know. Triple the amount of questions that they're asking right now. Yeah. You know, with that same example, what you could also do is now you're in that building. Now you have access. There's, is it a big building? Six units. Oh, perfect. You could write an individual letter to all six of the people, slide it under their door. If you want to or put it in their mailbox and say, just so you guys know, I'm renting this property for so and so. If you guys are interested in either renting or selling or just want to see what your place is worth for rental or for sale, I can just run that up for free for you. You know, it just does as a, you know, gratis thing. And there you go right there. I want to go through one other example. We have a listing in the Hancock right now. And we did this wild video. And our seller goes, you know, everyone is so unhappy. I should probably shouldn't say this. We're going to do it anyway. Many of the people are unhappy with the representation in the building because there's, you know, X number of people who dominate in the building. Right. So you're talking about there's REALTOR who, REALTORS who may even live in the building or who really just focus on the Hancock building. They become kind of the go to person. I would argue that many people will be like, oh, okay, that's interesting and move on with their lives. For us, we recognize an opportunity to, you know, make sure that everyone knows just the level of marketing that we're doing. So, you know, we first of all, the simplest thing is to ask, hey, do you know anyone else who is selling? We love to help them. And I think I've probably come a little, become a little immune to like the anxiety that that may provoke in others. But asking the question, like, who's who's thinking about selling? We would love to help them. That question is enough. But if not, you know, we're already fliring the entire building and have a QR code to the video that we're doing. We can maybe queue it. You can pull it up. It's I dive into the pool in my purple suit. I've seen it. Oh, you did see it. It's a great video. Yeah. So that's for the Hancock. Yeah. Okay. So I, this is a great commercial. We will put a link to that commercial. And well, commercial isn't really the right word, but short form video. We'll put that in because that is an, I was shocked when I saw that. You dove in with a full suit into a pool. Yeah, Zach was Zach's off screen, but we, so we were there and in slow motion, by the way. Yeah, I actually dove in slow motion. That wasn't a incredible. That wasn't a trick of the video. But I was standing there and I'm like, you know, trying to get just get a video. I didn't plan on it. And I'm like, I'm here. I'm going to suit. I have a change of clothes. And I think maybe within three minutes of making the like the decision. I was I was in the water. But like also, you know, that's opportunity to literally do something that people aren't willing to do and capture it on camera is opportunity. And then you could also post you obviously you've already posted it on a social. You can tag the handcock in it. You can, you know, hashtag it up and do all sorts of things. Yeah. So, but getting back to the, you know, I really am cautious of people's time here. And thank you for bringing me on. I really want to try to bring as much value as humanly possible in like the 10 minutes that we have people's attention is, you know, DJ, you actually brought this up when we were, you know, talking pre-shoot here is, you know, what I would challenge everyone who's watching to do right now is take a look at the last 10 opportunities that have come their way and really do a deep dive into how the opportunity actually came about. And to your point, try to duplicate that. So I'll give you an example. Like if you, you know, you're touring with a buyer and it came from a referral. The referral source may be your sister, your brother, your friend. But from there, where were you? What happened that was the catalyst to have the friends say, Hey, DJ, Hey, Ben, you should really talk to Kim. Yeah. Let's say it was a dinner party. Yeah. So it's like, okay, you don't, you might not recognize that you have a real opportunity to double triple quadruple the amount of dinner parties you go to or host. Yeah, or host them. Yeah. Because that's when those opportunities come about and the opportunities are hidden, I think where you may hear someone say, like, Oh, my friend got a new job. Oh, my friend is moving to Cincinnati or whatever the case may be. And there's your opportunity. And I actually wanted to talk about this in particular job transfer. If I told you that my sister just got a job transfer to Cincinnati, you're a real estate agent. What should you be thinking? I'm going to find the best real estate agent in Cincinnati and call them and say, how would you like a free lead? Right. And I'm making the assertion and, you know, I'm happy for people to jump in the comments, be like, of course, you idiot. Everyone does. Everyone knows that. No, no, they don't know. They don't. That and that's, that's my belief. And I think that referral income is like really low hanging fruit that people don't recognize. And it goes both ways. Let's say that example that we just gave you someone's moving to town. People are so excited to have, you know, received the lead that, you know, they just get into, okay, let's go out and tour property. Let me understand your criteria. Let me put you a touch. There's so much to do. Let me put you in touch with the lender and let me get you set up on our search platform. But if they're moving here, what's your situation over there? Right. And my favorite income in the entire business is referral. Sure. You know, let me negotiate my, you know, referral fees are getting higher and higher. They were 25 or 20 when I started and now you can get up to 35 and nobody bats and I. Yeah. Well, if they're moving from Cincinnati, oh, you own in Cincinnati. Well, let me do, like I have gone as far as, let me do the research for you. Right. It's different when a consumer with limited knowledge goes and explores a real estate agent. I'll do it for you. And you know how to interview the agent. You know what you're looking for. And you know how to develop the relationship. And when you talk to that agent, because hey, by the way, I expect you to in a, in a cute way, you can sort of say it, but I expect you to be doing, but let's do this all the time for each other. Exactly. So then it extends one step further. Hey, I don't know how often you have people moving from Cincinnati to Chicago, but then you develop another relationship. And again, it comes, you know, comes down to, I just gave you three examples. One, the, uh, listing, the rental listing is right over here in Wicker Park, the Hancock and this Cincinnati thing. They add up, you have a 10% chance here, a 10% chance here, a 10% chance here. But people just aren't doing it and they're not doing it with a level of consistency, recognizing that there's, there might be more to, you know, the business that's just staring at them right in the face. Well, in the referral example is really powerful because you're not, you're no longer trading hours for dollars. Like you are literally handing it off, hoping for the best and just going to get a check if it, if it's back to closes and you knock out enough of those, you'll just get, you'll just hammer checks all the time. Yeah, there's, there's many, many agents that I am familiar with who, like that's their whole job. I know, I've had them on my show. The, I know agents that are YouTubers that all they do is put out content that people who are looking to buy or sell in a particular area, you know, they do certain neighborhoods, they talk about restaurants, they do not leave their office. They do not show homes, they do not work with clients. All they do is they pick a city, they pretend that they live there and they do content. And then when they get those leads, they just pass them off. Yeah. So, you know, I'm interested in like your experience when you're talking to, I mean, you have how many agents at Kale 700 plus 700 plus agents. And my again, assertion is that I don't know how many of them are doing over 10 transactions a year, not as many as I'd like. Yeah, exactly. And I'm making the argument that the people who are doing like under 10 transactions, doing five, six, seven transactions, they are ignoring opportunity that is staring at them right in the face. And I can only tell you from my experience that it took, it took longer than you may think to understand that the opportunity is there. And without at this point, I'm almost not interested in the business that's there, like the seller and the buyer because the job is done. Whatever I had done in the past, you already know how to do that. Yeah, it's here. Okay, how can I maximize my profits by thinking one step, two steps, three steps further, asking all of the relevant questions and making, you know, there's a huge difference between one client and two clients. If I can turn every client into, you know, 50% more business, well, I'm probably going to have a successful career. Yeah, and this also brings up the opportunity to for referrals to other industries, right? So are other other ancillary stuff. So who's your state planning attorney? Oh, you don't have a will. We need to get that just set up for you. Call my guy or, you know, how, how about account? Do you have an account? I've got the best one. You know, things like that where you can set up these referral, reciprocal referral relationships and just get business all day. Yeah. And, you know, I don't actually think it is confined to sales. I think it's also relevant to talk about the, because ultimately what we're talking about is opportunity that extends outside of a transaction. And I want to use like kind of this as the example sitting here with you. I'm not sure where any of this is going to lead. But, you know, you have to put yourself out there because you believe that there is like reciprocal, not reciprocal additional opportunity. I believe that this may lead to referral partnerships with agents who are watching. I believe that agents may join my team because of this. And you have to be ready to have the DJ. If someone, I'm asking you right now, if an agent reaches out, can you please put them in touch with me? Yeah. Yeah. Right. And you have to have the guts to actually ask that question so that it actually happens as opposed to, you know, crossing your fingers and hoping. And in fact, Jay's goodwill. We do have a relationship like that because Ben has said, because I recruit for for kale and Ben has said, Hey, if you have somebody that's not a fit for kale, but would be a fit for my team, can you pass them over to me? And I'm like, well, sure, why wouldn't I? Yeah. What you actually said was, sure, what will you, and there's nothing wrong with it. Like what what's in it for me? I'm like, I love this. Yeah. It's two business people trying to do right by each other. Yeah. And that's how it goes. But that's the opportunity that is sitting right. The obvious, I know you're recruit. You know, I'm hiring. All right. Cool. Let's make something happen. Yeah. Yeah. I also want to give one little tip that I think is a really fun way about do going back to duplicating a client. So I'm going to ask you, we'll go through this exercise. Just take some minute. And I encourage everybody to go through this as we're going through it with Ben, sort of think about these answers on your own, because we're going to give you a strategy here that will absolutely work. So I want you to think of, we're not going to use their name. We'll call them, well, depending on what their gender is, we'll call them John or Sally. Think of an client that you really liked working with and you wished if you could duplicate that client, and that could be the one that you work with mostly. People like that. That that would be a great business for you. John. John. Okay. What does John do for a living? He's a consultant. He's a consultant. Perfect. Okay. So here's what you do. We now know John, we do you want to work with more consultants? Yeah. Okay. And do you know pretty much what they want and what they need? Oh, for sure. Okay. Great. And even if you said no, then you could call John and say, Hey, I want to work with more consultants. What do they want? And okay. So now you call John and you say, Hey, John, I am working on my marketing plan for this year. I would love to get your advice. By the way, he's a consultant. He gives advice. He loves that too. You do this with anybody. But consultants love doing this. I would love to get your advice on something. Can I swing by your office for five minutes or can I meet you for a cup of coffee? Five minutes is all I need. So what you're doing is you're asking for their advice. When people ask for advice, it is very flattering. It is, it is boost their ego. It makes them feel good. And you're not selling them anything. You're literally asking for help. So you say, Hey, John, I want to meet you up for coffee for five minutes. I just want to run this idea by you, get your thoughts on it. Let me know what you think or you know, do you have time? Okay. Great. Meet him for coffee. You're going to ask John two questions. The first is, Hey, John, I loved working with you so much. And I realized there are lots of consultants here in Chicago. I don't really, first of all, I want to work with more consultants. First question is, do you think that's a good idea? He's going to say, yes. And if he says no, then you go, well, why not? But he's going to say yes. Say, sure. Yeah. Why not? Then second question is great. If you were me, how might you get in front of more consultants? And you shut up and he will tell you, oh, we belong to this group or we have this meetings or I'll introduce you to some friends of mine or swing by the office and I'll introduce it's literally that simple. And I'm telling you, it works. So again, the two steps are to duplicate your client, call them up and say, Hey, or three steps rather. I want to take just a couple of minutes of your time. I've got this marketing idea. I want to run it by you and get your advice. I really think you'd help me. You'd be able to help me with this. Great. Okay. Meet him. Hey, I want to work with more X just like you, more doctors, more lawyers, more teachers, more nurses, whatever, just like you. Do you think that's a good idea? It is great. Hey, if you were me, how might you go about doing it? And then you shut up. And I'm telling you if you do this once a week, you will have so much business, so many people, people, what people will ultimately do is they will go, Oh, I work at a, there's a hundred accounts at my firm. Why don't I get in touch with the human resources person home buyer seminar? Yeah. Home buyer seminar. Yeah. That's what we do all the time. So smart. So what we will do and recognize opportunities like we keep on, you know, doing business with people. Oh, I can, this has happened. So like we've done home buyer seminars with the bulls Pepsi. We're about to do one with a whirlpool. And you just, it's not hard. Like they have, they're emailing you from their Pepsi account or from their world pro account. Hey, would it be useful to you? If I came in and did a home buyer seminar, because then you're also providing value, they get the opportunity to show their company that, you know, they're in for the long haul and that they're looking out for the company as a whole and their benefit. And you get to provide value that way too. And yeah, it's again, an exercise in. Where is the opportunity? And then I would add an element to your, you know, your speech with the consultant is, how can you provide value to them? And it's like the law of reciprocity. Yeah. Yeah, that's another thing is how can I help you in your business? So that would be maybe the third question to ask is how can I help you? And most of the time people say, I'm good. But if they eat something, maybe you can help them. And, you know, if you're an agent who is, you know, running a team, for example, forget about listings and buyers. The opportunity for like recruiting agents is not always staring at you in the face. I'll, I'm going to give you an example of a few agents who've had tremendous success on my team. They started as clients and they say something to you like, do you like being a real estate agent? I'm like, yeah, I do. I can leave it there. Right? Or you could say, why? I've been thinking about getting my license. Like, then you know that I'm at this point. You really should. And, you know, you can come work under me. We've had, I've had more than, I mean, an interesting amount of people have started their career with me that way. Or if you are out on a showing and I'm not advocating for poaching any agents. But an agent is saying they're having a really tough time and they're a solo agent. They're not on the team. Cool. How about, you know, you come in for an interview, see if maybe there's something there. Maybe there's not. But there's opportunity. Yeah. Everywhere. We have found that. You know, a lot of people have their licenses and they, they're just not doing anything with them. And it's just a side and they're really, really talented. Well, hey, like, why don't we cultivate that together? Yeah, we, we own a holding company, which is for agents that aren't actively practicing. But they just want to keep their license and good standing with the state. They have other jobs where they've retired. They're just not, you know, actively working with clients. They don't pay MLS dues. They're just want their license to sit somewhere. So what's great about that is we tell them, yeah, we'll hold it for, you know, problem. But did you know you can still earn referral commissions along the way? So everything that you really said today can still apply even to agents that aren't actively practicing. Because you can still find opportunity and then refer it out to anyone you want. Yeah. And I'll just add one other point. I'm just like, okay, how can you make an extra few bucks? Is, did you know that locksmiths will pay referral fees? Did you know that moving companies will pay referral fees? General contractors closet, you know, closet people, you know, real estate agents out of the, have you heard the cliche that we're the center of the referral economy? Yeah. Well, you shouldn't be doing these things in my opinion, like for free. Right? Like so go and talk to your, you know, your favorite mover, your favorite handyman and just be like, listen, I'm going to give, I'm going to refer everyone to you. And maybe as simple as like when I move, I expect you to do my move for free. Yeah. It's reasonable. Yeah, somebody like that. I want to earn it. Yeah. And it doesn't have to be anything crazy. But there's opportunities are limitless and people need to recognize them. I agree. And I would just throw in one idea that occurred to me when we were talking about one of your examples about somebody getting married. I'd also start chatting with wedding planners. Yeah. Great idea. So I'll give you something. When I was shopping for my ring, it's a close friend, Shara, Hakimi and Jim imports, Hakimi, Jim imports. I was like, hey, like when people are getting married, I'm sure they're looking for a place. So I brought him a, I think it was like 16, a couple of a case of who I'm like, I want you. If I put my business card on all of them, every time someone gives you the final check, you grab a bottle of food and you put it, this is for my real estate agent, give him a call. It did not work DJ. So don't do that. But it's worth a try. It's definitely worth a try. And you know, or with when you're talking to your financial advisor, your accountant, hey, they're talking to the people that you want to be talking to every single day, but it's not going to happen unless you open your mouth. And that's what this all comes down to, unless you open your mouth, you're willing to put yourself out there and ask for the opportunity. And I think it could both like that's what this all boils down to is you don't get what you don't ask for. Ask for the opportunity. Ask the question and you'd be surprised once you're comfortable asking it 20, 50, 100 times. I promise it's going to end up working out in your favor. Yeah, especially if it's past client, they like you. They want to help you. And you also should be chatting with them anyway to keep the relationship strong. And also you should be knowing what's going on in their lives. And hey, do you have any friends that are, you know, going through a life transition right now? I mean, we know 58% of marriages end in divorce, right? So that's another thing to keep in mind is divorce attorneys, right? We've been getting again, lots of opportunity out there. You just have to think about beyond your existing problem of I don't have enough leads. I don't have enough business. There's not a lot, not enough homes for sale in my area. I have all these buyers that don't, you know, yes, those are problems. And there's not an easy way to solve that. But there is always an easy way to find other opportunities. You just have to think outside of the problem. Every interaction that people have today, there is, I don't know if it's small or large, but there is an additional opportunity to be had. That's, I know that for certain, yeah, at this point, right? And I'll give you an example today, we get any lead that we get. We do research on them, you know, kind of immediately. The first thing you should be doing is understanding if they own something. And just start there. Do they own like a buyer comes in, you know, 90% of the time they're not going to be owning something, but they might. And you'd be surprised that they may own something in another, you know, another city. Just start there. But then you need to be asking questions, hey, do you own any other property? Are you looking to buy any other property? Are you moving? Do you need a referral for this or that? And that's like the basics, but it's one of those things. So me and my sales director, David Fields. We, we're actually not sure, DJ, if this is something that can be learned. Or if it's just in people, right? I don't know if this can be taught. What do you think? I think you can be taught. I think it's a skill. So I, but it requires somebody to practice. And so I think this goes back to putting in the time, putting in the reps, asking a lot of questions. And this gives you a reason to pick up the phone. It gives you a reason to send a text or make a video message. You know, these are the things you can always reach out to instead of just saying, hey, you're going to buy yourself your home this year next year. You can ask all sorts of other questions tangentially related to real estate or not. And continue the conversation and find those little modicums of opportunity. Yeah, I think we've probably beat a dead horse at this point. Agreed. Yeah, but recognize opportunity with Ben and DJ. I love it. I love it. So if you didn't get a lot out of this, this conversation, then you go back and relisten because there was a lot of Ben gave unbelievable examples of exactly what he and his team are doing to find opportunity that isn't so obviously sitting in front of you again, that elusive obvious when you, you uncover it through questioning. So it's there. You just have to have a process and you systematize everything. So that's another thing we should talk about in a future episode is exactly how to systematize your business so that you're not thinking about what do I need to do next. You have a process for what I need to do next. And therefore you can track it. You can, you can see, look at the metrics. You can see how effective it is and then make improvements. If you don't have those metrics, you're sort of flying blind, right? Or you don't have those systems, you're flying blind. So we're going to talk about that in a future episode right now for everyone. Follow Ben Lala's on Instagram. What's your Instagram account? The Ben Lala's team.
