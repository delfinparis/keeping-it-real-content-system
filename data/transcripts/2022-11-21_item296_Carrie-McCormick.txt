[00:02:50] Carrie, welcome once again to the show.
[00:02:52] Thank you.
[00:02:53] You always have such a nice intro.
[00:02:55] It makes me so happy.
[00:02:56] So thank you.
[00:02:56] Well, I'll tell you, I am always happy to talk to you
[00:03:00] because and I just was going to sound like a humble brag.
[00:03:04] And maybe I guess it is, but that's not really my intention.
[00:03:07] So I'm prefacing this by saying, please forgive,
[00:03:09] please audience and Carrie, forgive me for the brag,
[00:03:11] but we just crossed over or maybe we didn't,
[00:03:14] but we're right on the cusp of crossing over two million downloads
[00:03:17] in the lifetime of the show.
[00:03:18] And I bring that up because you've been with us
[00:03:20] almost since the very beginning.
[00:03:22] So part of the reason why we're now doing even higher numbers
[00:03:26] than ever before is because of you.
[00:03:28] So thank you for helping us get to.
[00:03:30] Oh, it's so amazing.
[00:03:31] Yes.
[00:03:31] Yeah.
[00:03:32] It's an awesome podcast.
[00:03:33] And you've got great followers and continues to grow.
[00:03:38] So I'm happy to be part of it.
[00:03:39] So thank you.
[00:03:40] Thank you.
[00:03:41] So what's going on this month?
[00:03:44] All right.
[00:03:44] November.
[00:03:46] And I know we've got listeners not only here in Chicago,
[00:03:48] but we have listeners all over the United States.
[00:03:51] So I just wanted to kind of talk about a broad United States
[00:03:55] market data.
[00:03:58] And I know everyone knows this, but as we move into fall,
[00:04:03] our market continues to slow down.
[00:04:06] And we know that consumer prices and higher mortgage
[00:04:09] interest rates are squeezing our buyers.
[00:04:12] And it's just an affordability challenge.
[00:04:14] And even hearing people talk about not only
[00:04:17] from homeownership, but auto loans and grocery, everything.
[00:04:23] Everything seems to be going up and people are getting squeezed.
[00:04:26] So right now mortgage rates are at 55% higher
[00:04:31] than they were a year ago.
[00:04:32] It's just, and I was saying we were going 150 miles an hour
[00:04:36] last year.
[00:04:37] And now we've come to this, I feel like it's like 50 miles an hour.
[00:04:40] It's like this screeching halt.
[00:04:42] We're still driving at the limit, or our speeding limit,
[00:04:46] but it just feels like it's just so quiet.
[00:04:49] So it's tough.
[00:04:52] And just here in Chicago, for those that are here in Chicago,
[00:04:55] our new listings in the city of Chicago
[00:04:58] for single-family homes was down 2.7%.
[00:05:03] And it was down almost 30% for attached homes,
[00:05:08] which is our condo and town home market, which that's a big number.
[00:05:13] Our under contract, so that was new listings were down.
[00:05:17] Our under contracts for single-family homes is down 22%,
[00:05:22] and down 28%, almost 30%, also for attached homes.
[00:05:26] So these are big decreases in our market.
[00:05:30] And I know that Chicago acts like a market within a market.
[00:05:34] Each neighborhood is very independent.
[00:05:37] And again, those stats are just over the city of Chicago
[00:05:40] as a whole.
[00:05:41] So we're down, you know, so it's a message
[00:05:45] that we have to give to our sellers,
[00:05:48] all the stats, all the data, the information,
[00:05:50] we've got to communicate that to our sellers.
[00:05:52] So that's important.
[00:05:54] But every November, I've been doing this for 22 years.
[00:05:57] I've been a broker here in Chicago for 22 years.
[00:06:00] Every November, I look back at the year
[00:06:03] and figure out what I did right.
[00:06:05] I figure out what I did wrong,
[00:06:07] and I try to create a business plan for the next year into 2023,
[00:06:11] because with the holidays coming,
[00:06:14] it's gonna go quickly.
[00:06:15] Now's a great time to start your business plan.
[00:06:19] And it can be a daunting task for a lot of people,
[00:06:22] if you've never done one.
[00:06:24] And I'm gonna give you just a few quick tips
[00:06:26] and anyone that wants more information
[00:06:29] or to have a quick phone call,
[00:06:31] I'm always available to talk to people about it.
[00:06:33] Now to say that what I do is 100% correct,
[00:06:36] but what I do for me, at least it works.
[00:06:39] So let me give you some quick tips on a business plan.
[00:06:43] Gather your numbers.
[00:06:45] And when you look at them,
[00:06:47] figure out what worked and what did not work.
[00:06:50] That is the important part of it.
[00:06:51] So think about the number of listing appointments
[00:06:54] you've taken for 2023, I'm sorry, 2022.
[00:06:57] Look at your calendar.
[00:06:58] Look at the number of listing appointments that you took.
[00:07:01] Look at how many deals that you close this year.
[00:07:05] Number of buyer appointments,
[00:07:07] number of days and hours that you worked each week.
[00:07:11] That's a hard one.
[00:07:13] But for me, it's, I don't know if I can even calculate it,
[00:07:16] but just look at your calendar of the time that you've taken off
[00:07:20] and look at the days that you've worked.
[00:07:22] Look at your number of conversations you had each day.
[00:07:26] Big one is look at your marketing budget.
[00:07:28] How much money have you spent?
[00:07:31] And then look at where you spent the money
[00:07:34] and the lead sources that came from,
[00:07:36] what worked, what didn't work.
[00:07:38] And again, just look at your GCI and then look at your volume.
[00:07:41] These are all data numbers.
[00:07:43] And hopefully through the year,
[00:07:44] if you were organized with a calendar
[00:07:46] or writing things down,
[00:07:48] this will be easy to calculate.
[00:07:50] And you're gonna quickly see where you spent money
[00:07:55] and it didn't have a good return
[00:07:56] or you're quickly gonna see, oh my gosh,
[00:07:59] I had these 10 listing appointments
[00:08:01] and they were all came from this one ad that I ran
[00:08:03] or came from the one postcard that I sent out.
[00:08:07] And then going into 2023,
[00:08:09] those are the things that you should double down.
[00:08:12] You're marketing money on and focus on
[00:08:14] so you can get more business.
[00:08:17] I'm curious, as you were reviewing,
[00:08:19] what I would love to ask you,
[00:08:21] what did you think you didn't do a good,
[00:08:23] that you have room for improvement for next year?
[00:08:26] Do you have anything as you're reviewing the year,
[00:08:28] what you wish you would have done different?
[00:08:30] Yeah, I think, I spent a lot of money online,
[00:08:35] which through 2022,
[00:08:39] I've very focused on what is working with it
[00:08:43] and what is not working.
[00:08:44] And I'm constantly changing it.
[00:08:45] So I think monitoring it and not waiting six months,
[00:08:49] but monitoring your online spend monthly is important
[00:08:53] because those are quick stats.
[00:08:55] You're gonna really see what's working
[00:08:56] and what's not working through engagement,
[00:09:00] through responses on it.
[00:09:01] So I think that's something that you do have to focus on.
[00:09:05] I would say I do a lot of print advertising as well.
[00:09:09] That's a little bit harder to gauge the ROI.
[00:09:11] So to answer your question,
[00:09:12] I think what I need to focus on is my postcard mailings
[00:09:16] and just mailings in general of,
[00:09:19] it's a lot of money to do that.
[00:09:21] And I'm not getting as good a return.
[00:09:22] So either I'm gonna cut back on it or I need to perfect it.
[00:09:25] And I think I'm gonna perfect it.
[00:09:27] You know, it's funny is the development that I bought
[00:09:30] that you represented as the seller, your group represented.
[00:09:36] I was just realizing I've been there a year and a half
[00:09:38] and I have not received one postcard,
[00:09:43] not from you because I wouldn't expect to receive it from you,
[00:09:46] of course, but from any REALTOR or anywhere.
[00:09:49] Now, understanding that this is a new development
[00:09:51] that people just moved into,
[00:09:52] are we looking to move anytime soon?
[00:09:54] No, obviously not or at least we still,
[00:09:56] no, I hope nobody's thinking of moving.
[00:09:58] So everything's going great.
[00:10:00] We all love the place,
[00:10:01] but I would think now would be a great time
[00:10:03] for another agent to sort of swoop in and be like,
[00:10:06] hey, hope you're loving your place.
[00:10:08] I know you're probably not gonna make a shift anytime soon,
[00:10:11] but I just wanted to start a relationship
[00:10:12] because we know that a lot of REALTORS
[00:10:15] who represent buyers end up the person buys the home
[00:10:18] and they don't hear from the REALTOR ever again.
[00:10:21] Now, my REALTOR was my boss.
[00:10:22] So he does it, well, he and I did it together.
[00:10:26] But the point is is I wouldn't expect him to send me anything,
[00:10:28] but no, not one other REALTOR.
[00:10:31] And again, it would take just a little creativity
[00:10:33] for someone to think about that,
[00:10:34] but I don't know, it seems like a good idea.
[00:10:37] It does.
[00:10:38] And that's another thing is think out of the side
[00:10:40] the box a little bit.
[00:10:41] I think doing postcards or mailings,
[00:10:43] templates all over the place,
[00:10:45] there's companies that do it,
[00:10:46] they all start to look the same.
[00:10:48] So you have to be a little bit creative
[00:10:50] think outside the box because if you received
[00:10:54] something a little bit different than mail,
[00:10:56] maybe you would open it or it would stand out to you
[00:10:59] because it was a little bit different
[00:11:00] than just a glossy postcard.
[00:11:02] So again, think out of the box a little bit
[00:11:04] if you're going to spend some money on postcards.
[00:11:07] Another thing is think about where you're spending
[00:11:10] your time and your energy.
[00:11:12] And this again sounds very easy.
[00:11:14] It took me years to start kind of time blocking
[00:11:17] and looking at things that got me distracted
[00:11:21] and figuring out where do I need to spend most of my time.
[00:11:25] And what do I, like a time audit,
[00:11:27] what's effective of my time,
[00:11:29] what is not effective of my time
[00:11:30] and figure that out and make a daily routine
[00:11:34] of what works for you and what doesn't work for you.
[00:11:36] It's different for everybody.
[00:11:37] There is a saying by Tony Robbins
[00:11:39] and it's sometimes it's not what you're willing to do
[00:11:45] that makes the difference.
[00:11:46] It's what you're no longer willing to stand.
[00:11:50] So there's things that are time sucks in our day, right?
[00:11:55] And I'm just trying to think what it is.
[00:11:56] But there's definitely things that are not productive
[00:11:59] and you really have to realize that when you're doing it
[00:12:02] and avoid it or give that task to somebody else,
[00:12:07] so they can focus on that
[00:12:08] and you can do income generating activities.
[00:12:13] I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor
[00:12:17] are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss.
[00:12:20] Now after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS
[00:12:22] in the country for the podcast,
[00:12:24] do you know which CRM is used by more than any other
[00:12:27] by our guests?
[00:12:28] Of course it is follow up boss.
[00:12:30] And let's face it, following up is the key
[00:12:32] to taking your business to the next level.
[00:12:34] Follow up boss will help you drive more leads
[00:12:36] in less time and with less effort.
[00:12:39] Do not take my word for it.
[00:12:40] Robert Slack who runs the number one team in the US
[00:12:43] uses follow up boss and he is built
[00:12:45] of one and a half billion dollar business in just six years.
[00:12:48] Follow up boss integrates with over 250 systems

[00:13:29] Follow up like a boss with follow up boss.
[00:13:31] And now back to our episode.
[00:13:34] Yeah, I agree.
[00:13:35] I think that's it's you're right.
[00:13:38] Like we can't control rates.
[00:13:39] We can't control buyer sentiment.
[00:13:42] As much as we can try to influence it,
[00:13:44] it's hard to influence sellers and buyers right now
[00:13:46] with the state of the market.
[00:13:48] And deals are falling apart at the last minute.
[00:13:51] We're seeing a record number of those.
[00:13:53] So things are outside of our control
[00:13:55] and in a lot of ways.
[00:13:57] And then there are things that are always within our control
[00:13:59] which is our activity.
[00:14:02] And actually I have a quick little story
[00:14:03] I thought I'd share with you in the audience
[00:14:05] because I think this is perfectly apropos
[00:14:09] to how maybe what agents can do right now
[00:14:12] while maybe things are a little slower than normal
[00:14:14] and everyone's stressed and yes, all of that is true.
[00:14:18] And there's things you can still do.
[00:14:20] So this just happened yesterday.
[00:14:21] It was one of my closest friends and his wife's anniversary.
[00:14:26] It was their ninth anniversary.
[00:14:28] Here's how I knew that.
[00:14:29] I had put it in my calendar or in the contact form.
[00:14:34] Sorry, the contact, I have for each of them,
[00:14:37] I have their anniversary date
[00:14:38] because I was there at their wedding
[00:14:40] and I wrote it down or I asked them later, whatever it was.
[00:14:43] Because I thought this is what my closest friends
[00:14:45] I probably should know when his anniversary is
[00:14:47] so that all I could do,
[00:14:49] and now I'm not a producing REALTOR.
[00:14:51] There's no, I'm not looking for anything here.
[00:14:53] I just want my friend to feel that I care about him.
[00:14:56] So I sent, so I have in my little calendar every day
[00:14:59] if it's somebody's birthday,
[00:15:00] if it's one of their children's birthdays,
[00:15:02] if it's an anniversary,
[00:15:03] it's the only way I would ever remember to do anything
[00:15:06] is even my own family the stuff is,
[00:15:08] I write it down because I don't,
[00:15:10] when is my parents anniversary?
[00:15:12] I think it's April something
[00:15:14] but I don't always remember it perfectly.
[00:15:16] So I put all of my friends information
[00:15:19] and so I sent a text to my friend and his wife yesterday
[00:15:22] going, hey, happy ninth anniversary.
[00:15:23] It was literally took two seconds
[00:15:25] and his wife, who I'm not as close with,
[00:15:28] I don't know her as well as I know him,
[00:15:29] she wrote me back and she's like,
[00:15:31] you were the only person every year
[00:15:33] outside of their like immediate family
[00:15:35] that knows it's our anniversary
[00:15:37] or if they know it, nobody else writes us about it.
[00:15:40] And it was just took two seconds
[00:15:41] and I'm like, that is so easy to do.
[00:15:45] And she was like, how do you do that?
[00:15:46] And I was like, well, I just put it in a calendar
[00:15:49] but there's no magic to it at all.
[00:15:52] But the point is, is now is a great time
[00:15:54] to think about your communication strategy
[00:15:58] for staying in touch with everybody over the next year.
[00:16:01] And now is a great time to call all your clients
[00:16:04] and say, hey, I'm just updating my contact,
[00:16:07] you know, whatever my marketing system.
[00:16:09] I just wanna make sure that I have all your data
[00:16:11] correctly in here.
[00:16:13] I wanna make sure your birthday's on such and such day, right?
[00:16:15] Great, okay, hey, just out of curiosity,
[00:16:17] what's your anniversary, Dad?
[00:16:18] I'd love to just know that so I can give you guys
[00:16:22] a quick hello or something on your anniversary.
[00:16:23] Like people will tell you this stuff,
[00:16:25] especially if they're past clients.
[00:16:26] I mean, that shouldn't be any problem at all.
[00:16:28] But certainly, what I'm trying to,
[00:16:31] the point I'm trying to make is you wanna stack the deck
[00:16:33] with reasons to reach out to somebody.
[00:16:35] And it doesn't have to be, hey, you wanna buy your cello home,
[00:16:38] it's like, hey, I remember your anniversary.
[00:16:41] Like people care very much when you demonstrate
[00:16:45] that you care for them and that you've taken time
[00:16:48] to look, build it into your life,
[00:16:50] that their lives are important.
[00:16:53] And really simple and easy.
[00:16:54] So I know I'm talking about this a lot,
[00:16:56] but guys, this is a great time to just update your database.
[00:16:59] Call all your clients, say, hey, I'm just getting my,
[00:17:02] you know, getting some things together for 2023.
[00:17:04] Just wanna make sure I have the right data for you.
[00:17:06] You know, and you say, oh, by the way, you know,
[00:17:08] I wouldn't even ask if you'll feel close enough,
[00:17:11] ask them what their kids' birthdays are,
[00:17:12] ask them what grades their kids are in.
[00:17:14] If not birthdays, ask them, hey, you know,
[00:17:16] what grades are they in?
[00:17:16] So you have an idea so that when school rolls around,
[00:17:19] you maybe have a list of people to, you know,
[00:17:21] give some, you know, care packages for kids
[00:17:24] in grade school or high school or college.
[00:17:27] Or I think there's lots of cool ways
[00:17:28] you can demonstrate care that don't have anything
[00:17:32] to do with the market conditions
[00:17:33] and that maybe will pay dividends
[00:17:35] when people are ready to buy yourself.
[00:17:37] I think that's so good.
[00:17:38] Sometimes it's the little things that matter.
[00:17:41] And I just wanted to finalize
[00:17:42] and this are called by saying the seven tips
[00:17:46] that I have for marketing for 2023.
[00:17:49] So I'm gonna say my seven tips will be video, video,
[00:17:55] you have to do video, you have to do video.
[00:17:58] I know people don't like to do it
[00:18:01] or they don't wanna be in front of the camera,
[00:18:03] but it's just, it's going to dominate in 2023.
[00:18:06] So just get used to it and do video.
[00:18:09] So that's number one.
[00:18:11] Two would be team up with a mortgage lender to strategize.
[00:18:14] You know, as we are in this market
[00:18:16] with these crazy interest rates,
[00:18:18] we do need a professional on our side to strategize.
[00:18:21] There's all these different buy down programs
[00:18:24] and different ways to message it.
[00:18:26] So definitely team up with a mortgage lender.
[00:18:28] I'm also going to tell you to create a blog,
[00:18:32] which I don't have one.
[00:18:33] So I'm gonna try to do that for 2023.
[00:18:36] New as letters, your website,
[00:18:38] get all of that in the right place.
[00:18:42] Refresh your social media profiles.
[00:18:44] And that's another thing.
[00:18:45] These are all good reminders for me to do too.
[00:18:48] Make sure that all of your profiles are up to date
[00:18:50] and refresh your headshots.
[00:18:53] There's brokers out there that I've looked them up online.
[00:18:56] So I just know who I'm meeting and I meet them.
[00:18:58] And they look nothing like their pictures.
[00:19:01] So it's a good time to refresh your headshots.
[00:19:04] QR codes use those, utilize those
[00:19:08] in your marketing campaign to capture client information.
[00:19:12] I don't know where I'm at number wise,
[00:19:15] but clean up your CRM,
[00:19:17] strategize on a system just like you said
[00:19:19] to stay in touch with your clients.
[00:19:21] There's different tools.
[00:19:22] You can call people, you can email them,
[00:19:24] you can send them a survey to get information.
[00:19:27] And then just I think finally,
[00:19:30] a marketing tip for everyone is work on your messaging
[00:19:33] and what your purpose is.
[00:19:35] I think when you know and you can communicate
[00:19:38] who you are, what you do, what your purpose is
[00:19:41] to your clients, they'll better understand you
[00:19:44] and what your job is to do for them.
[00:19:47] Yeah, I agree.
[00:19:48] All of those are such great ideas.
[00:19:51] So I think you know, great time to take a step back
[00:19:54] from the craziness of where inventory and rates are
[00:19:58] and sort of say, well, I can't do much about that right now.
[00:20:01] But now is maybe a time to invest in some more learning,
[00:20:05] some more skill development, you know,
[00:20:07] getting the marketing down for next year.
[00:20:10] And I'll just give this one final tip from a marketing.
[00:20:13] I perspective, I say it all the time.
[00:20:15] I've said it probably on the show,
[00:20:16] a bunch, I apologize for the review,
[00:20:19] but it's a great fundamental.
[00:20:21] Linked in is really great at a couple of things
[00:20:23] and one of those is work anniversaries.
[00:20:27] So I was talking about romantic anniversaries,
[00:20:29] wedding anniversaries dating anniversaries earlier,
[00:20:32] but work anniversaries are another thing.
[00:20:34] So this is something that usually nobody knows
[00:20:37] if they're work anniversaries.
[00:20:38] So in a way, if you can find out,
[00:20:40] like I don't even know it's a work anniversary for me
[00:20:42] until I start getting messages on LinkedIn going,
[00:20:44] hey, congrats, right?
[00:20:46] Like we never know, most people don't know
[00:20:48] their actual anniversaries.
[00:20:49] So another great reason is you just go to the LinkedIn
[00:20:53] activity feed and you literally can just check it every day
[00:20:56] and you'll probably see when people get promotions,
[00:20:59] when they get a new job,
[00:21:00] when they have a work anniversary,
[00:21:02] all of these are things that people would never expect you
[00:21:05] to reach out to except on LinkedIn
[00:21:08] when they tell people it's their work anniversary,
[00:21:11] that you get a lot of messages,
[00:21:13] but how about a phone call?
[00:21:14] How about a text message?
[00:21:15] How about going a little bit beyond
[00:21:17] and noticing something like that?
[00:21:19] And again, just demonstrating care.
[00:21:22] So anyway, I love that.
[00:21:24] I think, yeah, I think it's a great place to wrap up.
[00:21:27] We should also mention two quick things.
[00:21:29] Right now, I think is also a great time
[00:21:32] to build relationships with REALTORS in other markets.
[00:21:36] It's a wonderful time to really say, okay,
[00:21:39] my clients tend to move or retire to
[00:21:43] or have vacation homes in X, Y and Z places.
[00:21:47] And so for example, if you have,
[00:21:49] if you're a REALTOR and you have people that live
[00:21:52] or that want to live in Chicago some time of the year
[00:21:55] or maybe a second home here or they're moving to this area
[00:21:58] or down to Florida or Texas or wherever people
[00:22:01] are moving these days.
[00:22:04] Not Charlotte, but Charleston is a big one, Nashville,
[00:22:08] of course, lots of places are having these big booms.
[00:22:12] Now's a great time.
[00:22:13] And so Carrie would love the opportunity to work with you
[00:22:15] if you have clients that are interested
[00:22:17] in the Chicago land area.
[00:22:19] She's literally one of the very most successful REALTORS here.
[00:22:22] She does it all herself.
[00:22:23] It doesn't get passed over to a team member.
[00:22:25] It's literally her.
[00:22:26] So if anyone's listening who isn't a REALTOR
[00:22:29] but just a buyer or seller or renter or investor,
[00:22:32] a developer who wants to work with a top REALTOR here in Chicago,
[00:22:36] Carrie, we could not more highly recommend her.
[00:22:38] She's the best.
[00:22:39] Carrie, what's the best way that someone can reach out to you?
[00:22:43] Always call me 312-9614-612.
[00:22:47] Or you send me an email at Carrie at atproperties.com.
[00:22:52] Awesome.
[00:22:53] Well, we will bring this episode to a close.
[00:22:57] Don't let it bring you down as the song says.
[00:23:02] This is a tough time.
[00:23:04] Brokage is are down.
[00:23:06] Production is down for agents.
[00:23:08] It's just kind of where we're at.
[00:23:10] We can't do a whole lot about that except keep moving forward.
[00:23:14] Again, people want to work with people
[00:23:16] who demonstrate competence and care.
[00:23:18] So let's up your competence level.
[00:23:21] Ask more from your brokerage about skill development,
[00:23:25] knowledge training, and then ask more from yourself
[00:23:28] about staying in touch.
[00:23:30] So that next year you're like, all right,
[00:23:32] everybody in my database, I have five different times
[00:23:35] throughout the year that I'm calling them
[00:23:37] for different milestones or reasons to reach out.
[00:23:40] Birthdays, anniversaries, hey, I just check it in.
[00:23:43] How's everything going?
[00:23:44] School starting, school ending, whatever it might be.
[00:23:48] Come up with five or six reasons to reach out,
[00:23:50] not real estate related to each person in your contact list.
[00:23:54] And you're going to have a great 20, 20, 3, at least I hope so.
[00:23:57] So anyway, I'm carrying and on behalf of carrying myself
[00:24:00] as always, thank you to the audience.
[00:24:02] We are, this is our believe it or not,
[00:24:04] our highest month ever is this month
[00:24:07] as far as number of downloads.
[00:24:09] I don't get, I don't say that to brag.
[00:24:10] I'm just so encouraged.
[00:24:11] And it's really, we don't spend any money on marketing.
[00:24:15] I wish we probably did, but we don't.
[00:24:17] And so we're so grateful to everyone
[00:24:18] for telling a friend about our show.
[00:24:20] Please continue to do that.
[00:24:21] Think of one other real estate agent,
[00:24:23] maybe even a new agent who wants to hear,
[00:24:25] gosh, I wonder how somebody gets to the very top of the mountain
[00:24:28] like Carrie.
[00:24:29] Well, this is how.
[00:24:30] So definitely send them a link to our website
[00:24:32] keeping it real pod.com.
[00:24:34] And also, again, if you know anyone who's looking to buy cell rent
[00:24:38] or develop in Chicago, talk to Carrie.
[00:24:41] So on behalf of Carrie, myself, we say thank you.
[00:24:43] On behalf of the audience, we say thank you to Carrie.
[00:24:46] This is, it's so incredible to get somebody of her,
[00:24:49] of her skill level and her busyness level
[00:24:52] to be on our show for years and years now.
[00:24:54] We are so internally grateful.
[00:24:56] Oh, we're so thankful.
[00:24:57] So anyway, I'm Carrie, thank you again.
[00:24:59] And we will see everybody on the next episode.
[00:25:01] Thank you guys.

It makes me so happy. So thank you. Well, I'll tell you, I am always happy to talk to you because and I just was going to sound like a humble brag. And maybe I guess it is, but that's not really my intention. So I'm prefacing this by saying, please forgive, please audience and Carrie, forgive me for the brag, but we just crossed over or maybe we didn't, but we're right on the cusp of crossing over two million downloads in the lifetime of the show. And I bring that up because you've been with us almost since the very beginning. So part of the reason why we're now doing even higher numbers than ever before is because of you. So thank you for helping us get to. Oh, it's so amazing. Yes. Yeah. It's an awesome podcast. And you've got great followers and continues to grow. So I'm happy to be part of it. So thank you. Thank you. So what's going on this month? All right. November. And I know we've got listeners not only here in Chicago, but we have listeners all over the United States. So I just wanted to kind of talk about a broad United States market data. And I know everyone knows this, but as we move into fall, our market continues to slow down. And we know that consumer prices and higher mortgage interest rates are squeezing our buyers. And it's just an affordability challenge. And even hearing people talk about not only from homeownership, but auto loans and grocery, everything. Everything seems to be going up and people are getting squeezed. So right now mortgage rates are at 55% higher than they were a year ago. It's just, and I was saying we were going 150 miles an hour last year. And now we've come to this, I feel like it's like 50 miles an hour. It's like this screeching halt. We're still driving at the limit, or our speeding limit, but it just feels like it's just so quiet. So it's tough. And just here in Chicago, for those that are here in Chicago, our new listings in the city of Chicago for single-family homes was down 2.7%. And it was down almost 30% for attached homes, which is our condo and town home market, which that's a big number. Our under contract, so that was new listings were down. Our under contracts for single-family homes is down 22%, and down 28%, almost 30%, also for attached homes. So these are big decreases in our market. And I know that Chicago acts like a market within a market. Each neighborhood is very independent. And again, those stats are just over the city of Chicago as a whole. So we're down, you know, so it's a message that we have to give to our sellers, all the stats, all the data, the information, we've got to communicate that to our sellers. So that's important. But every November, I've been doing this for 22 years. I've been a broker here in Chicago for 22 years. Every November, I look back at the year and figure out what I did right. I figure out what I did wrong, and I try to create a business plan for the next year into 2023, because with the holidays coming, it's gonna go quickly. Now's a great time to start your business plan. And it can be a daunting task for a lot of people, if you've never done one. And I'm gonna give you just a few quick tips and anyone that wants more information or to have a quick phone call, I'm always available to talk to people about it. Now to say that what I do is 100% correct, but what I do for me, at least it works. So let me give you some quick tips on a business plan. Gather your numbers. And when you look at them, figure out what worked and what did not work. That is the important part of it. So think about the number of listing appointments you've taken for 2023, I'm sorry, 2022. Look at your calendar. Look at the number of listing appointments that you took. Look at how many deals that you close this year. Number of buyer appointments, number of days and hours that you worked each week. That's a hard one. But for me, it's, I don't know if I can even calculate it, but just look at your calendar of the time that you've taken off and look at the days that you've worked. Look at your number of conversations you had each day. Big one is look at your marketing budget. How much money have you spent? And then look at where you spent the money and the lead sources that came from, what worked, what didn't work. And again, just look at your GCI and then look at your volume. These are all data numbers. And hopefully through the year, if you were organized with a calendar or writing things down, this will be easy to calculate. And you're gonna quickly see where you spent money and it didn't have a good return or you're quickly gonna see, oh my gosh, I had these 10 listing appointments and they were all came from this one ad that I ran or came from the one postcard that I sent out. And then going into 2023, those are the things that you should double down. You're marketing money on and focus on so you can get more business. I'm curious, as you were reviewing, what I would love to ask you, what did you think you didn't do a good, that you have room for improvement for next year? Do you have anything as you're reviewing the year, what you wish you would have done different? Yeah, I think, I spent a lot of money online, which through 2022, I've very focused on what is working with it and what is not working. And I'm constantly changing it. So I think monitoring it and not waiting six months, but monitoring your online spend monthly is important because those are quick stats. You're gonna really see what's working and what's not working through engagement, through responses on it. So I think that's something that you do have to focus on. I would say I do a lot of print advertising as well. That's a little bit harder to gauge the ROI. So to answer your question, I think what I need to focus on is my postcard mailings and just mailings in general of, it's a lot of money to do that. And I'm not getting as good a return. So either I'm gonna cut back on it or I need to perfect it. And I think I'm gonna perfect it. You know, it's funny is the development that I bought that you represented as the seller, your group represented. I was just realizing I've been there a year and a half and I have not received one postcard, not from you because I wouldn't expect to receive it from you, of course, but from any REALTOR or anywhere. Now, understanding that this is a new development that people just moved into, are we looking to move anytime soon? No, obviously not or at least we still, no, I hope nobody's thinking of moving. So everything's going great. We all love the place, but I would think now would be a great time for another agent to sort of swoop in and be like, hey, hope you're loving your place. I know you're probably not gonna make a shift anytime soon, but I just wanted to start a relationship because we know that a lot of REALTORS who represent buyers end up the person buys the home and they don't hear from the REALTOR ever again. Now, my REALTOR was my boss. So he does it, well, he and I did it together. But the point is is I wouldn't expect him to send me anything, but no, not one other REALTOR. And again, it would take just a little creativity for someone to think about that, but I don't know, it seems like a good idea. It does. And that's another thing is think out of the side the box a little bit. I think doing postcards or mailings, templates all over the place, there's companies that do it, they all start to look the same. So you have to be a little bit creative think outside the box because if you received something a little bit different than mail, maybe you would open it or it would stand out to you because it was a little bit different than just a glossy postcard. So again, think out of the box a little bit if you're going to spend some money on postcards. Another thing is think about where you're spending your time and your energy. And this again sounds very easy. It took me years to start kind of time blocking and looking at things that got me distracted and figuring out where do I need to spend most of my time. And what do I, like a time audit, what's effective of my time, what is not effective of my time and figure that out and make a daily routine of what works for you and what doesn't work for you. It's different for everybody. There is a saying by Tony Robbins and it's sometimes it's not what you're willing to do that makes the difference. It's what you're no longer willing to stand. So there's things that are time sucks in our day, right? And I'm just trying to think what it is. But there's definitely things that are not productive and you really have to realize that when you're doing it and avoid it or give that task to somebody else, so they can focus on that and you can do income generating activities. I want to pause for a moment to talk about our episode sponsor are one of my favorite companies out there follow up boss. Now after interviewing hundreds of top REALTORS in the country for the podcast, do you know which CRM is used by more than any other by our guests? Of course it is follow up boss. And let's face it, following up is the key to taking your business to the next level. Follow up boss will help you drive more leads in less time and with less effort. Do not take my word for it. Robert Slack who runs the number one team in the US uses follow up boss and he is built of one and a half billion dollar business in just six years. Follow up boss integrates with over 250 systems so you can keep your current tools and lead sources. Also the best part they have seven day a week support so you'll get the help that you need when you need it and get this follow up boss is so sure that you're going to love their CRM that for a limited time they're offering keeping it real listeners a 30 day free trial which is twice as much time as they give everyone else. And oh yeah, no credit card required. So you can try it risk free but only if you use this special link. Visit followupboss.com forward slash reel. That's followupboss.com forward slash reel for your free 30 day trial. Follow up like a boss with follow up boss. And now back to our episode. Yeah, I agree. I think that's it's you're right. Like we can't control rates. We can't control buyer sentiment. As much as we can try to influence it, it's hard to influence sellers and buyers right now with the state of the market. And deals are falling apart at the last minute. We're seeing a record number of those. So things are outside of our control and in a lot of ways. And then there are things that are always within our control which is our activity. And actually I have a quick little story I thought I'd share with you in the audience because I think this is perfectly apropos to how maybe what agents can do right now while maybe things are a little slower than normal and everyone's stressed and yes, all of that is true. And there's things you can still do. So this just happened yesterday. It was one of my closest friends and his wife's anniversary. It was their ninth anniversary. Here's how I knew that. I had put it in my calendar or in the contact form. Sorry, the contact, I have for each of them, I have their anniversary date because I was there at their wedding and I wrote it down or I asked them later, whatever it was. Because I thought this is what my closest friends I probably should know when his anniversary is so that all I could do, and now I'm not a producing REALTOR. There's no, I'm not looking for anything here. I just want my friend to feel that I care about him. So I sent, so I have in my little calendar every day if it's somebody's birthday, if it's one of their children's birthdays, if it's an anniversary, it's the only way I would ever remember to do anything is even my own family the stuff is, I write it down because I don't, when is my parents anniversary? I think it's April something but I don't always remember it perfectly. So I put all of my friends information and so I sent a text to my friend and his wife yesterday going, hey, happy ninth anniversary. It was literally took two seconds and his wife, who I'm not as close with, I don't know her as well as I know him, she wrote me back and she's like, you were the only person every year outside of their like immediate family that knows it's our anniversary or if they know it, nobody else writes us about it. And it was just took two seconds and I'm like, that is so easy to do. And she was like, how do you do that? And I was like, well, I just put it in a calendar but there's no magic to it at all. But the point is, is now is a great time to think about your communication strategy for staying in touch with everybody over the next year. And now is a great time to call all your clients and say, hey, I'm just updating my contact, you know, whatever my marketing system. I just wanna make sure that I have all your data correctly in here. I wanna make sure your birthday's on such and such day, right? Great, okay, hey, just out of curiosity, what's your anniversary, Dad? I'd love to just know that so I can give you guys a quick hello or something on your anniversary. Like people will tell you this stuff, especially if they're past clients. I mean, that shouldn't be any problem at all. But certainly, what I'm trying to, the point I'm trying to make is you wanna stack the deck with reasons to reach out to somebody. And it doesn't have to be, hey, you wanna buy your cello home, it's like, hey, I remember your anniversary. Like people care very much when you demonstrate that you care for them and that you've taken time to look, build it into your life, that their lives are important. And really simple and easy. So I know I'm talking about this a lot, but guys, this is a great time to just update your database. Call all your clients, say, hey, I'm just getting my, you know, getting some things together for 2023. Just wanna make sure I have the right data for you. You know, and you say, oh, by the way, you know, I wouldn't even ask if you'll feel close enough, ask them what their kids' birthdays are, ask them what grades their kids are in. If not birthdays, ask them, hey, you know, what grades are they in? So you have an idea so that when school rolls around, you maybe have a list of people to, you know, give some, you know, care packages for kids in grade school or high school or college. Or I think there's lots of cool ways you can demonstrate care that don't have anything to do with the market conditions and that maybe will pay dividends when people are ready to buy yourself. I think that's so good. Sometimes it's the little things that matter. And I just wanted to finalize and this are called by saying the seven tips that I have for marketing for 2023. So I'm gonna say my seven tips will be video, video, you have to do video, you have to do video. I know people don't like to do it or they don't wanna be in front of the camera, but it's just, it's going to dominate in 2023. So just get used to it and do video. So that's number one. Two would be team up with a mortgage lender to strategize. You know, as we are in this market with these crazy interest rates, we do need a professional on our side to strategize. There's all these different buy down programs and different ways to message it. So definitely team up with a mortgage lender. I'm also going to tell you to create a blog, which I don't have one. So I'm gonna try to do that for 2023. New as letters, your website, get all of that in the right place. Refresh your social media profiles. And that's another thing. These are all good reminders for me to do too. Make sure that all of your profiles are up to date and refresh your headshots. There's brokers out there that I've looked them up online. So I just know who I'm meeting and I meet them. And they look nothing like their pictures. So it's a good time to refresh your headshots. QR codes use those, utilize those in your marketing campaign to capture client information. I don't know where I'm at number wise, but clean up your CRM, strategize on a system just like you said to stay in touch with your clients. There's different tools. You can call people, you can email them, you can send them a survey to get information. And then just I think finally, a marketing tip for everyone is work on your messaging and what your purpose is. I think when you know and you can communicate who you are, what you do, what your purpose is to your clients, they'll better understand you and what your job is to do for them. Yeah, I agree. All of those are such great ideas. So I think you know, great time to take a step back from the craziness of where inventory and rates are and sort of say, well, I can't do much about that right now. But now is maybe a time to invest in some more learning, some more skill development, you know, getting the marketing down for next year. And I'll just give this one final tip from a marketing. I perspective, I say it all the time. I've said it probably on the show, a bunch, I apologize for the review, but it's a great fundamental. Linked in is really great at a couple of things and one of those is work anniversaries. So I was talking about romantic anniversaries, wedding anniversaries dating anniversaries earlier, but work anniversaries are another thing. So this is something that usually nobody knows if they're work anniversaries. So in a way, if you can find out, like I don't even know it's a work anniversary for me until I start getting messages on LinkedIn going, hey, congrats, right? Like we never know, most people don't know their actual anniversaries. So another great reason is you just go to the LinkedIn activity feed and you literally can just check it every day and you'll probably see when people get promotions, when they get a new job, when they have a work anniversary, all of these are things that people would never expect you to reach out to except on LinkedIn when they tell people it's their work anniversary, that you get a lot of messages, but how about a phone call? How about a text message? How about going a little bit beyond and noticing something like that? And again, just demonstrating care. So anyway, I love that. I think, yeah, I think it's a great place to wrap up. We should also mention two quick things. Right now, I think is also a great time to build relationships with REALTORS in other markets. It's a wonderful time to really say, okay, my clients tend to move or retire to or have vacation homes in X, Y and Z places. And so for example, if you have, if you're a REALTOR and you have people that live or that want to live in Chicago some time of the year or maybe a second home here or they're moving to this area or down to Florida or Texas or wherever people are moving these days. Not Charlotte, but Charleston is a big one, Nashville, of course, lots of places are having these big booms. Now's a great time. And so Carrie would love the opportunity to work with you if you have clients that are interested in the Chicago land area. She's literally one of the very most successful REALTORS here. She does it all herself. It doesn't get passed over to a team member. It's literally her. So if anyone's listening who isn't a REALTOR but just a buyer or seller or renter or investor, a developer who wants to work with a top REALTOR here in Chicago, Carrie, we could not more highly recommend her. She's the best. Carrie, what's the best way that someone can reach out to you? Always call me 312-9614-612. Or you send me an email at Carrie at atproperties.com. Awesome. Well, we will bring this episode to a close. Don't let it bring you down as the song says. This is a tough time. Brokage is are down. Production is down for agents. It's just kind of where we're at. We can't do a whole lot about that except keep moving forward. Again, people want to work with people who demonstrate competence and care. So let's up your competence level. Ask more from your brokerage about skill development, knowledge training, and then ask more from yourself about staying in touch. So that next year you're like, all right, everybody in my database, I have five different times throughout the year that I'm calling them for different milestones or reasons to reach out. Birthdays, anniversaries, hey, I just check it in. How's everything going? School starting, school ending, whatever it might be. Come up with five or six reasons to reach out, not real estate related to each person in your contact list. And you're going to have a great 20, 20, 3, at least I hope so. So anyway, I'm carrying and on behalf of carrying myself as always, thank you to the audience. We are, this is our believe it or not, our highest month ever is this month as far as number of downloads. I don't get, I don't say that to brag. I'm just so encouraged. And it's really, we don't spend any money on marketing. I wish we probably did, but we don't. And so we're so grateful to everyone for telling a friend about our show. Please continue to do that. Think of one other real estate agent, maybe even a new agent who wants to hear, gosh, I wonder how somebody gets to the very top of the mountain like Carrie. Well, this is how. So definitely send them a link to our website keeping it real pod.com. And also, again, if you know anyone who's looking to buy cell rent or develop in Chicago, talk to Carrie. So on behalf of Carrie, myself, we say thank you. On behalf of the audience, we say thank you to Carrie. This is, it's so incredible to get somebody of her, of her skill level and her busyness level to be on our show for years and years now. We are so internally grateful. Oh, we're so thankful. So anyway, I'm Carrie, thank you again. And we will see everybody on the next episode. Thank you guys.
