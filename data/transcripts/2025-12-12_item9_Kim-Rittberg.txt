[00:01:14] Today's episode is brought to you by corded.io.
[00:01:18] Are you looking for agents to join your brokerage or team?
[00:01:21] Now, as a real estate recruiter, I can tell you the answer is always yes.
[00:01:26] But most agents aren't looking to move right now.
[00:01:29] So how do you know who to contact?
[00:01:31] Well, what if I were to tell you there's a recruiting and retention tool powered by
[00:01:34] artificial intelligence that shows you exactly which agents in your local market are looking
[00:01:40] to leave their brokerage right now and which agents at your own firm are also looking
[00:01:45] to leave you?
[00:01:47] Now, I've been recruiting REALTORS for 15 years and I've hired over 2000 agents.
[00:01:52] I can tell you with no exaggeration, this is the tool I've been waiting for.
[00:01:56] Corded's AI looks for trends across dozens of variables for each agent in your market
[00:02:01] and shows you which agents they believe are likely to move.
[00:02:04] Not only does it do that, but corded's AI went and visited my recruiting website and
[00:02:09] read everything I offer.
[00:02:11] So now when I'm recruiting, corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that
[00:02:16] agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer.
[00:02:19] It even writes emails for me.
[00:02:21] I've never seen anything like it and I use it every single day.
[00:02:25] Now, if you are looking to grow your brokerage, corded.io is the best tool out there.
[00:02:30] Visit corded.io to schedule a demo again.
[00:02:33] That's corded.io.
[00:02:35] And now, onto the show.
[00:02:51] Hello, keeping it real listeners.
[00:02:52] I'm going to keep this up so it's pretty short and then you're drinking eggnog.
[00:02:55] Probably rush and get your client list out doing some planning for next year.
[00:02:58] But it's really important that we look ahead to content.
[00:03:01] What should you be making as soon as the New York comes around?
[00:03:03] So if you haven't heard from me before, my name is Kim Ritberg.
[00:03:07] I'm a guest host on Keeping It Real and I love connecting with agents around the country.
[00:03:11] My background is that I was a TV producer and media executive for nearly 20 years and
[00:03:15] now I love coaching agents around the country to both get more clients but also establish
[00:03:20] yourself as the number one agent in your field through video and podcasts.
[00:03:25] So I love this idea of, all right, we're turning the page.
[00:03:28] It's the holiday season.
[00:03:29] We're looking ahead.
[00:03:30] What should you be posting?
[00:03:31] It's 2026.
[00:03:33] If you thought it was not 2026, well, okay.
[00:03:35] That's breaking news to you.
[00:03:38] One really great thing to do is to build that about me video.
[00:03:42] So why?
[00:03:43] As all the people who scroll past you, unless it's your mom or your best friend,
[00:03:47] they actually don't know that much about you, right?
[00:03:50] They don't know your personal history.
[00:03:51] They don't actually know the minutia of what you really bring to the table in terms of your work.
[00:03:58] Like what is your competitive advantage, right?
[00:04:01] What makes you different than the people around the corner?
[00:04:03] So I have agents who like really when you think about it, some of my agents their background
[00:04:08] is really strong financial background.
[00:04:10] I have agents who've been wall street, they've been accountants.
[00:04:14] That's a unique distinct advantage and they should be bringing that to the table, right?
[00:04:18] When they're explaining to people who I am and how I can help you.
[00:04:21] So when we're talking about that about me video, we want to bring all of the things that
[00:04:25] make us special.
[00:04:27] So I consider it the ABC method.
[00:04:29] I recommend using this either for your elevator pitch or about me.
[00:04:33] This is what I teach all around the country.
[00:04:35] I do a lot of keynotes.
[00:04:36] One of the things I do is teaching people how to lock up their elevator pitch in addition to
[00:04:40] how to get clients to your video, the ABC method, a, your accomplishments.
[00:04:46] You have to have to have to bring credibility.
[00:04:48] I say it all the time.
[00:04:50] Credibility is key.
[00:04:51] So make sure to bring accomplishments.
[00:04:53] What does that mean?
[00:04:54] If you are ranked a certain number, the total dollar amount of homes you've sold,
[00:04:58] anything you've done in your past careers, right?
[00:05:01] Like I mentioned before, accounting or finance or maybe you were a designer.
[00:05:05] I have people who've switched from education.
[00:05:07] You're an educator.
[00:05:08] So educate, right?
[00:05:09] A lot of your clients probably don't know that much about the process and you being an
[00:05:12] educator really helps them.
[00:05:14] So show people what is special about you, how you are unique.
[00:05:18] Accomplishments can also be past clients that you helped, save money, make more money,
[00:05:23] more stress-free experience.
[00:05:26] I've had some of my agent clients have helped people from overseas or from another state
[00:05:30] move in seamlessly.
[00:05:32] That's a huge win, right?
[00:05:33] So when we're talking about accomplishments, it's not just like, oh, I was featured in
[00:05:36] this newspaper.
[00:05:37] It can be a lot of different things.
[00:05:39] So ABCA, we're using accomplishments.
[00:05:41] Be business.
[00:05:42] This sounds very obvious, but a lot of people do not tell people very clearly who I am and
[00:05:47] what I do.
[00:05:48] So business for you means what you do, specifically who you serve, what niche, what demographic,
[00:05:53] what neighborhood.
[00:05:54] I hate when people come to me like, I'm a real estate agent.
[00:05:57] Okay.
[00:05:58] So is everyone else?
[00:05:59] Who do you help?
[00:06:00] Who do you serve?
[00:06:01] What makes you different?
[00:06:02] So really include that.
[00:06:03] And with an eye on how can you serve them in a different way?
[00:06:09] That again speaks to that accomplishments piece a little bit, but what makes you different?
[00:06:13] Right?
[00:06:14] So I like to say what people say, I get on calls with people and they say, why should
[00:06:17] I work with you?
[00:06:17] What makes you different?
[00:06:18] And I say my background is in journalism.
[00:06:21] I really understand what makes you seem credible.
[00:06:24] What makes you seem like an expert?
[00:06:25] It's also in marketing.
[00:06:26] I have trained thousands of people to be on camera.
[00:06:29] I've written thousands of scripts for people on the news for digital, for social media.
[00:06:34] So I really make sure to explain that that makes me different than another person who is
[00:06:38] maybe a social media manager.
[00:06:40] And their thing is making videos, but they don't necessarily step back and think about
[00:06:44] the thought leadership piece, the expertise piece.
[00:06:47] Right?
[00:06:47] I've worked at Netflix.
[00:06:48] I've worked at Fox.
[00:06:49] I've written stories from 30 seconds long to an hour long.
[00:06:52] It's just a different perspective.
[00:06:53] So I really make sure to bring that up and for you, you have to think about what makes
[00:06:57] you different.
[00:06:58] So a, accomplishments, be business and see confidence.
[00:07:02] If you don't believe it, no one else will.
[00:07:04] You have to own your words.
[00:07:05] You have to love your words.
[00:07:06] You have to love your pitch.
[00:07:09] Right?
[00:07:09] Fall in love with your own words.
[00:07:11] And a lot of times at the beginning, when we're starting to say our elevator pitch or intro,
[00:07:15] doesn't feel that comfortable.
[00:07:16] That's okay.
[00:07:17] But over time, you have to get more comfortable with saying it.
[00:07:21] So practice in the mirror.
[00:07:23] Practice it in your house.
[00:07:24] Talk to your cat.
[00:07:25] Talk to your dog.
[00:07:25] Talk to your dresser.
[00:07:26] You have to say your elevator pitch a lot.
[00:07:29] So in that about me video, again, same thing.
[00:07:31] You'll have your script.
[00:07:32] Practice saying it out loud.
[00:07:33] Really bring your heart and soul into it.
[00:07:36] Connect with people.
[00:07:36] Video is the fastest, most effective way to get clients.
[00:07:39] It beats every other piece of content, photos, texts.
[00:07:42] It gets shared more.
[00:07:43] So if you control it on camera with confidence and letting people know who you are and why
[00:07:48] you're amazing, that's key.
[00:07:50] So I kept this one short.
[00:07:52] I promised you you can go drink your eggnog.
[00:07:53] I know you have so much to do.
[00:07:55] It's a holiday season.
[00:07:56] But as you go into 2026, make sure you have that about me video.
[00:08:00] Okay, I'm going to give you a bonus tip just because I like you.
[00:08:03] One more thing you can do is predictions for 2026.
[00:08:07] Again, I don't want you like looking into a crystal ball, but taking what you know so far,
[00:08:11] what you're seeing so far and reminding people, I'm your partner.
[00:08:15] I can take you through this.
[00:08:16] So, and I would do this.
[00:08:18] I think you'll like this.
[00:08:19] I would post really soon after you write it, right?
[00:08:22] You don't want to say your predictions are from this week and post a two weeks later.
[00:08:25] But really share with people, this is what I've been seeing.
[00:08:28] This is I've been in real estate three years, 10 years, 20 years, whatever.
[00:08:32] And you say there's always ebbs and flows of the market.
[00:08:34] I would love to connect with you and help you be the partner in navigating this.
[00:08:38] So no matter what the market is like, have them really see that you can be their partner.
[00:08:43] So now freebies.
[00:08:45] I have some great freebies.
[00:08:47] If you're really looking to grow your business,
[00:08:49] grow your client base with video, make sure to go to Kimrickberg.com slash RETips.
[00:08:54] And I also have for the first time ever,
[00:08:56] a really, really low ticket, amazing item for real estate agents called Real Estate Video Kickstart.
[00:09:02] It is under $50.
[00:09:03] And you could do it at your own pace.
[00:09:04] It is all of the things that I teach my clients, how to show confident camera,
[00:09:08] what to talk about, what to say.
[00:09:10] It's such an amazing thing.
[00:09:11] And then in there, you get a chance to work with me one on one at a super discounted price.

[00:09:17] So that is, you'll see that go visit my website, Kimrickberg.com.
