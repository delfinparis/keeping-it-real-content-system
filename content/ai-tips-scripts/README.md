## Production Notes

- Film each script in one take minimum — imperfection is authenticity
- Add captions to all videos (80% watched on mute)
- On-screen title = the "Do X — Not Y — To Get Z" line
- Tag AI tools used when relevant (builds authority in the AI space)
- Read each CTA at the end — engagement signals matter to all algorithms
