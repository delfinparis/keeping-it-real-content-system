## SCRIPT #41
**CATEGORY:** Market & Industry
**AVATAR:** All
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to prep interest rate talking points — not wing it — to keep nervous clients from walking
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude / Perplexity

**HOOK:**
Your client just texted you: "Rates went up again. We're thinking of waiting." What do you say?

**PROBLEM:**
Most agents either panic alongside their client, give a vague "rates always come down" answer, or launch into a lecture that sounds like they Googled it this morning. None of these responses build confidence. And a client who loses confidence walks — often for months or years.

**AI FIX:**
Once a month, sit down with Claude and current rate data from Perplexity and ask it to prepare three response frameworks for the most common rate-anxiety conversations: "Should we wait for rates to drop?" "Rates are too high to buy right now." "We're going to rent instead." Each framework should include a simple math example, a local market data point, and a human-centered closing line. Practice them until they're natural.

**REFRAME:**
Your job isn't to predict rates. Your job is to help clients make confident decisions with real information. AI helps you give them that.

**CTA:**
What's the rate question you hear most from clients right now? Drop it below.

## SCRIPT #42
**CATEGORY:** Market & Industry
**AVATAR:** All
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to explain your value post-NAR settlement — not stumble through it — to stop losing on fees
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude

**HOOK:**
The NAR settlement changed what buyers ask you. Most agents still don't have a great answer.

**PROBLEM:**
Since the settlement, buyers are being asked to sign buyer representation agreements before you show them a house. Many don't understand why, what they're agreeing to, or what you actually do to earn your fee. If you can't explain your value clearly in the first two minutes of that conversation, you're starting the relationship with friction — and some agents are losing clients before they even start.

**AI FIX:**
Ask Claude to help you build a two-minute "value conversation" for new buyers — something that explains what you do, why a signed agreement protects them, and what the compensation conversation looks like in plain English. Then roleplay it with Claude playing a skeptical buyer who just read about the settlement online. Practice until it doesn't feel like a pitch.

**REFRAME:**
Agents who can explain their value confidently will win more clients post-settlement. Those who stumble will lose them.

**CTA:**
How are you currently handling the buyer rep agreement conversation? Tell me your approach.

The NAR settlement changed what buyers ask you — and most agents still don't have a clean answer. Since the settlement, buyers are asked to sign representation agreements before you show a home. Many don't understand why, what they're agreeing to, or what you actually do to earn your fee. If you can't explain your value clearly in the first two minutes of that conversation, you're starting the relationship with friction. Here's the fix. Ask Claude to help you build a two-minute "value conversation" for new buyers — one that explains what you do, why the agreement actually protects them, and what compensation looks like in plain English. Then have Claude play a skeptical buyer who just read about the settlement online and push back on you. Practice until it stops feeling like a pitch and starts feeling like a real conversation. Agents who can explain their value confidently will win more clients post-settlement. Those who stumble will lose them. How are you currently handling the buyer rep conversation? Tell me your approach.

## SCRIPT #43
**CATEGORY:** Market & Industry
**AVATAR:** Forgotten Middle / Aspiring Top Producer
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to build a Zillow and Redfin counter-argument — not panic — to win clients who shop discount
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude / Perplexity

**HOOK:**
Your prospect just said: "We're thinking of using Redfin — it's cheaper." Here's what not to say.

**PROBLEM:**
Most agents respond to the discount broker objection defensively — which immediately makes it feel like a debate about your commission rather than a conversation about their outcome. You should never defend your fee. You should make the value of full representation so clear that the fee comparison becomes irrelevant.

**AI FIX:**
Ask Claude to research the average list-to-sale price ratio, days on market, and buyer satisfaction scores for discount brokerages versus full-service agents in your market. Then ask it to write you a two-minute response to the Redfin/discount objection that's purely data-driven, never defensive, and always focused on the client's outcome — not your commission. Practice it until you can deliver it conversationally.

**REFRAME:**
The agents who lose to discount brokers are the ones who talk about price. The ones who win talk about results.

**CTA:**
Have you ever lost a client to a discount broker? Tell me what they said.

**FULL SCRIPT (spoken):**
Your prospect just said: "We're thinking of using Redfin — it's cheaper." Here's what most agents do wrong. They get defensive — and the moment you're defending your fee, you've already framed this as a price debate. You should never have to defend your commission. You should make the value of full representation so obvious that the comparison becomes irrelevant. Here's how. Ask Claude to pull data on list-to-sale price ratios, days on market, and satisfaction scores for discount versus full-service agents in your market. Then ask it to write a two-minute response to the discount objection that's purely data-driven, never defensive, and always focused on the client's outcome. Practice it until it sounds like a conversation, not a pitch. The agents who lose to discount brokers talk about price. The ones who win talk about results.

## SCRIPT #44
**CATEGORY:** Market & Industry
**AVATAR:** All
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to find opportunities in low inventory — not just complain about it — to keep writing offers
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude / Perplexity

**HOOK:**
"There's nothing to show my buyers." That statement is costing you deals — because it's not entirely true.

**PROBLEM:**
Low inventory is the default excuse for slow business in many markets. But agents who consistently produce in tight markets aren't finding inventory everyone else missed — they're generating inventory through relationships, outreach, and hustle. Most agents wait for the MLS to fill up. Top producers don't.

**AI FIX:**
Ask Claude to generate a ten-point "off-market inventory strategy" tailored to your specific market conditions. It should include: targeted neighborhood letters to homeowners who might consider selling, scripts for calling expired listings from two and three years ago, a strategy for connecting with probate attorneys and estate sale companies, and social media posts that attract would-be sellers who haven't listed yet.

**REFRAME:**
Inventory doesn't just come from the MLS. It comes from agents who work harder and smarter when everyone else is waiting.

**CTA:**
What's your best strategy for finding off-market inventory? Share it below.

## SCRIPT #45
**CATEGORY:** Market & Industry
**AVATAR:** All
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to create monthly market updates — not skip them — to become the source your clients trust
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude / Perplexity

**HOOK:**
If your clients are getting their market information from the news instead of from you, you've already lost your position as their trusted advisor.

**PROBLEM:**
Most agents don't send regular market updates because writing them takes time and they don't know how to make them interesting. So their clients get their information from Zillow headlines and cable news — which are often alarmist, out of context, and not specific to their neighborhood.

**AI FIX:**
Once a month, gather your local MLS data — average sale price, days on market, list-to-sale ratio, active inventory. Give that data to Claude and say: "Write a two-paragraph market update for homeowners in [your market] that explains what these numbers mean for a seller and for a buyer. Make it conversational, not statistical. End with one actionable insight." Send it to your entire database by email and text. Takes twenty minutes. Builds your reputation as the expert.

**REFRAME:**
The agent who becomes the most trusted information source becomes the agent who gets the most calls when it's time to buy or sell.

**CTA:**
Are you sending regular market updates to your database? Yes or no — drop it below.

## SCRIPT #46
**CATEGORY:** Market & Industry
**AVATAR:** Forgotten Middle / Aspiring Top Producer
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to understand Gen Z buyers — not ignore them — to capture the market no one else is working
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Perplexity / Claude

**HOOK:**
Gen Z is entering the housing market right now — and most agents have no idea how to talk to them.

**PROBLEM:**
Gen Z buyers communicate differently, research differently, and make decisions differently than any generation agents have worked with before. They've done twelve hours of online research before they talk to you. They communicate by text. They trust peers more than professionals. If you approach them the way you approach Boomers, you'll lose them before the first showing.

**AI FIX:**
Ask Perplexity to pull the latest research on Gen Z home-buying behavior — what they value, how they communicate, what their financial profile actually looks like. Then bring that into Claude and say: "Given this research, help me rewrite my buyer consultation, my follow-up process, and my communication style for a Gen Z first-time buyer." The agents who adapt early will own this demographic.

**REFRAME:**
Gen Z is making 50% more income than boomers were at their age. They can afford homes. The question is whether you can afford to ignore them.

**CTA:**
Have you worked with a Gen Z buyer? Tell me what surprised you most about them.

**CATEGORY:** Market & Industry
**AVATAR:** Aspiring Top Producer / Team Leader
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to monitor competitor agents — not guess — to stay ahead in your market
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Perplexity / Claude

**HOOK:**
You're competing against agents you've never even looked up. That's a problem.

**PROBLEM:**
Most agents have only a vague sense of who their real competition is. They know the big names in the market but haven't looked at their online presence, their recent sales, their messaging, or their reviews. You can't differentiate yourself from competition you haven't studied.

**AI FIX:**
Use Perplexity to research your top five competitors: their recent production, their social media positioning, their Google reviews, their website messaging. Then bring that into Claude and ask: "Based on how these agents position themselves, identify three gaps or underserved angles I could own in this market." You might find that no one is serving a specific neighborhood, price range, or client type — and that's your opening.

**REFRAME:**
In business, the fastest way to find an opportunity is to find a gap that your competition is leaving open.

**CTA:**
Who's your biggest competitor in your market right now? Drop their style in the comments — not their name.

## SCRIPT #48
**CATEGORY:** Personal Brand & Marketing
**AVATAR:** All
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to find your niche — not try to serve everyone — to become the obvious choice for someone
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude

**HOOK:**
"I work with all buyers and sellers in the greater metro area." That is the most forgettable sentence in real estate marketing.

**PROBLEM:**
Agents are terrified of niching down because they think it means turning away business. It doesn't. It means becoming the obvious choice for a specific group of people — which generates more business, not less. When you're everything to everyone, you're memorable to no one.

**AI FIX:**
Ask Claude to help you run a "niche discovery" session. Answer these questions: What types of clients do you enjoy most? What neighborhoods or price ranges do you have the most experience in? What life transition do you understand deeply — divorce, downsizing, relocation, first-time buyers? What does your best client look like? Claude will find patterns in your answers and suggest two or three niche positions that are authentic to your actual experience.

**REFRAME:**
The riches are in the niches. A niche doesn't shrink your market — it sharpens your message.

**CTA:**
If you had to pick one type of client to specialize in, who would it be? Tell me below.

## SCRIPT #49
**CATEGORY:** Personal Brand & Marketing
**AVATAR:** All
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to write in your own voice — not sound like a robot — to build trust at scale
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude

**HOOK:**
People can tell when AI wrote your content. And they trust it less when they can.

**PROBLEM:**
Most agents use AI by asking it to "write a post about real estate." The result is generic, toneless, and sounds like every other AI-generated content in their feed. The audience senses it's not really you — and authenticity is the entire point of personal brand content.

**AI FIX:**
The fix is to train Claude on your voice before asking it to write for you. Paste three to five examples of content you've written yourself — captions, emails, texts — and say: "Analyze my writing style. What's my tone, vocabulary, sentence length, and personality? Now write a post about [topic] in that exact voice." The output will actually sound like you. Do this once and save it as a Claude project or system prompt.

**REFRAME:**
AI is a force multiplier for your voice — not a replacement for it. The goal is more of you, not less.

**CTA:**
Does your AI-generated content actually sound like you? Be honest below.

**CATEGORY:** Personal Brand & Marketing
**AVATAR:** Forgotten Middle / Burned-Out Veteran
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to get comfortable on camera — not keep avoiding it — to build the audience your business needs
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude

**HOOK:**
Every week you avoid posting video, someone else is showing up in the feed of people who should be your clients.

**PROBLEM:**
Camera anxiety is real. Most agents know they should be creating video content — the data is overwhelming on its effectiveness. But the fear of saying something wrong, looking awkward, or being judged keeps them off camera entirely. So they post graphics and text while their competitors build audiences with video.

**AI FIX:**
Use Claude to eliminate the prep anxiety. Before filming any video, give Claude your topic and ask it to generate five possible opening lines, three key points, and a closing question. Then practice saying it out loud three times — not to film it perfectly, but to hear yourself say it. The first thirty seconds is what most people dread. Claude gets you past the blank page so you can get past the blank stare.

**REFRAME:**
You don't need to be a great presenter. You need to be a real person talking about something you actually know. AI handles the outline. You handle the delivery.

**CTA:**
When's the last time you posted a talking-head video? Drop the date — even if it's embarrassing.

## SCRIPT #51
**CATEGORY:** Personal Brand & Marketing
**AVATAR:** All
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to repurpose one piece of content — not create from scratch every time — to multiply your output
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude

**HOOK:**
You're leaving ninety percent of your content's value on the table by only posting it once.

**PROBLEM:**
Most agents create one piece of content, post it once, and move on. But a single podcast episode, video, or blog post contains enough material for a week's worth of social media. The agents who show up most consistently aren't creating more — they're repurposing better.

**AI FIX:**
Give Claude any long-form content you've created — a video transcript, a podcast clip, a newsletter. Say: "Turn this into: one LinkedIn post, three Instagram captions, five tweet-length insights, and one email subject line test. Preserve the core insight and adapt the format and tone for each platform." In fifteen minutes, one piece of content becomes a week of posts across every platform.

**REFRAME:**
Create once. Distribute everywhere. AI makes the multiplication instant.

**CTA:**
What's the best piece of content you've created that most people never saw? Drop a description below.

**CATEGORY:** Personal Brand & Marketing
**AVATAR:** Forgotten Middle / Aspiring Top Producer
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to optimize your Google Business profile — not neglect it — to get found by buyers and sellers near you
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude / Perplexity

**HOOK:**
Right now, someone in your market is Googling "real estate agent near me." Are you showing up — or is your competitor?

**PROBLEM:**
Most agents completely neglect their Google Business profile. It's either incomplete, hasn't been updated in years, or has no posts or review responses. Google Business is often the first impression a potential client has of you — before your website, before your social media, before any conversation. And most agents treat it like an afterthought.

**AI FIX:**
Use Claude to do a complete Google Business audit. Ask it: "What makes an optimized real estate agent Google Business profile? Give me a checklist of everything I should have, including photo types, service categories, post frequency, and review response best practices." Complete the checklist in one afternoon. Then ask Claude to write your first five Google Business posts and a review response template.

**REFRAME:**
Google Business is free, local, and high-intent. It's the easiest marketing win most agents are ignoring.

**CTA:**
When's the last time you updated your Google Business profile? Drop your honest answer.

**CATEGORY:** Personal Brand & Marketing
**AVATAR:** All
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to respond to online reviews — not ignore them — to convert skeptical prospects into clients
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude

**HOOK:**
Your online reviews aren't just feedback — they're your sales team. Most agents treat them like a report card.

**PROBLEM:**
Most agents don't respond to their Google and Zillow reviews at all — or they write a generic "thank you for your kind words" that tells potential clients nothing. A well-written review response is actually read by prospects who are on the fence. It shows your personality, your professionalism, and how you treat people.

**AI FIX:**
For every new review you receive, use Claude to write a response that's personal, warm, and specific — not a template. Give Claude the review and say: "Write a response that thanks this client by referencing something specific in their review, reinforces one key value I provided, and feels genuinely human — not corporate." For negative reviews, ask Claude to help you draft a response that's calm, accountable, and shows future clients how you handle problems.

**REFRAME:**
How you respond to reviews tells future clients more about you than the review itself.

**CTA:**
Do you respond to every review you receive? Yes, no, or sometimes — drop it below.

**CATEGORY:** Personal Brand & Marketing
**AVATAR:** Aspiring Top Producer
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to build a hyperlocal content strategy — not general real estate content — to dominate your market online
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude / Perplexity

**HOOK:**
National real estate content competes with everyone. Hyperlocal content competes with almost no one.

**PROBLEM:**
Most agents post about broad real estate topics — mortgage rates, national trends, general buying tips — because they're easy to create and seem relevant. But that content blends into thousands of identical posts from thousands of agents nationwide. The agents who dominate their local market online are posting about their specific neighborhood, their specific city, their specific community.

**AI FIX:**
Use Perplexity to research your target neighborhoods: new restaurants opening, school ratings, walkability scores, upcoming development, local events, micro-market stats. Then ask Claude to build a sixty-day hyperlocal content calendar using that research — posts that position you as someone who actually lives and breathes the neighborhood, not someone who just sells houses in it.

**REFRAME:**
Being the neighborhood expert online isn't just a marketing strategy. It's a lead generation engine that runs without ad spend.

**CTA:**
What's one hyperlocal thing about your market that most people don't know? Drop it below — let's see what you've got.

**CATEGORY:** Client Management
**AVATAR:** All
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to handle difficult client situations — not react emotionally — to protect the deal and the relationship
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude

**HOOK:**
Your most difficult client isn't testing your patience — they're testing your systems. And most agents don't have one.

**PROBLEM:**
Difficult clients often behave the way they do because they're anxious, uninformed, or feel out of control. Most agents respond by getting defensive, avoiding the conversation, or matching the client's energy — none of which helps. The result is a damaged relationship, a deal at risk, and a lot of stress.

**AI FIX:**
When a difficult client situation arises, before you respond — bring it to Claude. Describe what happened and ask: "How should I respond to this situation to de-escalate, preserve the relationship, and keep the deal on track? Give me three communication approaches based on the client's likely emotional state." Then pick the one that fits and execute it calmly. Never send an emotional response in real time.

**REFRAME:**
Difficult clients don't need a reactive agent — they need a calm, strategic one. AI helps you become that.

**CTA:**
What's the most difficult client situation you've ever navigated? Tell me below — without using their name.

Your most difficult client isn't testing your patience — they're testing your systems. And most agents don't have one. Difficult clients often behave the way they do because they're anxious, uninformed, or feel out of control. Most agents respond by getting defensive, avoiding the conversation, or matching the client's energy. None of that helps — and all of it puts the deal at risk. Here's the fix. When a difficult client situation comes up, before you respond, bring it to Claude. Describe what happened and ask: "How should I respond to de-escalate this, preserve the relationship, and keep the deal on track? Give me three approaches based on the client's likely emotional state." Pick the one that fits and execute it calmly. Never send an emotional response in real time. Difficult clients don't need a reactive agent — they need a calm, strategic one. AI helps you be that. What's the most difficult client situation you've ever navigated? Tell me below — no names needed.

## SCRIPT #56
**CATEGORY:** Client Management
**AVATAR:** Burned-Out Veteran / All
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to set client expectations upfront — not manage chaos later — to reduce stress on every deal
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude

**HOOK:**
Ninety percent of client problems in real estate come from expectations that were never set.

**PROBLEM:**
Most client frustrations — the 9pm texts, the unreasonable demands, the "why didn't you tell me about this?" conversations — are preventable. They happen because nobody explicitly communicated what the process looks like, what the client is responsible for, and what they should and shouldn't expect from their agent.

**AI FIX:**
Use Claude to build a "client expectations packet" — a two-page document you send to every new buyer or seller at the start of the relationship. It should cover: how you communicate and your typical response time, the transaction timeline and what happens at each stage, the client's responsibilities in the process, and common surprises that happen in real estate and how you'll handle them. Give this to every client before the first showing.

**REFRAME:**
Setting expectations isn't defensive. It's the first act of excellent client service.

**CTA:**
What's the most common "why didn't you tell me?" conversation you have with clients? Drop it below.

## SCRIPT #57
**CATEGORY:** Client Management
**AVATAR:** All
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to ask for referrals — not awkwardly hint at it — to turn happy clients into a lead source
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude

**HOOK:**
You have dozens of happy past clients who would refer you in a heartbeat — if you just asked the right way.

**PROBLEM:**
Most agents either never ask for referrals or they ask in a way that feels awkward and transactional: "Do you know anyone looking to buy or sell?" It lands like a sales pitch, not a genuine request. The client feels put on the spot and usually says "I'll keep you in mind" — and then forgets about it.

**AI FIX:**
Ask Claude to write five different referral request messages for different situations: post-closing thank you, the six-month check-in, the one-year anniversary, a casual text version, and a social media version clients could share. Each should feel personal, be specific about who you're looking to help, and make it easy for the client to take action. Then load them into your CRM and actually send them.

**REFRAME:**
Asking for a referral isn't awkward. Not asking when your client would be thrilled to help you — that's the real waste.

**CTA:**
When's the last time you explicitly asked a past client for a referral? Tell me below.

## SCRIPT #58
**CATEGORY:** Client Management
**AVATAR:** All
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to handle ghosting — not chase endlessly — to re-engage leads without losing your dignity
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude

**HOOK:**
A lead going quiet doesn't mean they're gone. It usually means your last message didn't give them a reason to respond.

**PROBLEM:**
Most agents respond to ghosting by sending more of the same: "Just following up." "Wanted to check in." "Haven't heard from you." These messages communicate exactly the wrong thing — that you need the deal more than they do. Clients ghost when they feel pressure or when they have nothing interesting to respond to.

**AI FIX:**
Ask Claude to write a three-touch "re-engagement sequence" for ghosted leads that provides genuine value instead of pressure. Touch one: a relevant market update for their target area with no ask. Touch two: a property that just came on the market that matches what they told you they wanted. Touch three: a genuine, low-pressure "I want to make sure I'm still helpful to you — is your timing still the same?" Each message gives them a reason to respond — not a reason to feel guilty for not responding.

**REFRAME:**
Leads don't ghost agents they find valuable. They ghost agents they feel pressure from.

**CTA:**
How many ghosted leads do you have right now? Drop a rough number below.

## SCRIPT #59
**CATEGORY:** Client Management
**AVATAR:** All
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to build a VIP client experience — not treat everyone the same — to generate more referrals from your best clients
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude

**HOOK:**
Not all clients are created equal — and treating your best ones like everyone else is a missed opportunity.

**PROBLEM:**
Most agents provide the same level of service to every client. But twenty percent of your clients are responsible for eighty percent of your referrals. These are your advocates — the ones who talk about you at dinner parties, send you their friends unprompted, and write five-star reviews without being asked. If you treat them the same as everyone else, you're leaving a massive amount of repeat and referral business on the table.

**AI FIX:**
Use Claude to help you design a "VIP client tier" — a set of extra touches that go only to your top advocates. Ask it: "Design a twelve-month VIP experience for a past real estate client that includes quarterly check-ins, value-add touchpoints, and milestone moments that would make them feel genuinely valued. Keep it personal and not salesy." Identify your top ten past clients and start running them through it this week.

**REFRAME:**
Your best clients don't need more marketing. They need more appreciation. AI helps you deliver it consistently.

**CTA:**
Who's the one past client you know would refer you to everyone if you just stayed in better touch? Think of them right now.

## SCRIPT #60
**CATEGORY:** Client Management
**AVATAR:** Stuck Intermediate / Forgotten Middle
**ON-SCREEN TITLE:** Use AI to create a seller prep guide — not overwhelm clients — to get listings market-ready faster
**AI TOOL FEATURED:** Claude

**HOOK:**
The gap between a house that sells in five days and one that sits for ninety is almost always preparation. Most sellers don't know what they don't know — until you show them.

**PROBLEM:**
Most agents give sellers a general list of things to fix and then hope for the best. But sellers are emotionally attached, don't know what matters to buyers, and often spend money on the wrong things or do nothing at all. Without a clear, prioritized pre-listing guide, you're going to market with a house that isn't ready.

**AI FIX:**
Ask Claude to generate a "Seller Prep Playbook" tailored to your market and price range. It should include: the ten highest-ROI improvements before listing, a room-by-room decluttering checklist, what buyers in your specific market care most about right now, and what common mistakes sellers make that reduce their final sale price. Turn it into a beautiful PDF and give it to every seller at the listing appointment as a value-add tool.

**REFRAME:**
A prepared home sells faster and for more money. A prepared seller trusts you more. AI helps you create the tool that makes both happen.

**CTA:**
What's the one thing most sellers do that you wish you could stop them from doing before listing? Drop it below.
