# Master Polish & Ranking Prompt — AI Agent Minute Series

## How to Use This Prompt

1. Open a **new Claude.ai conversation** (Projects recommended — keeps context persistent)
2. Paste the entire contents of **ALL_100_SCRIPTS.md** as your first message
3. Paste this entire prompt as your second message
4. Claude will polish all 100 scripts, score them, and produce the full ranking in one session

> **Note:** ALL_100_SCRIPTS.md is ~40,000 words / ~50,000 tokens. Claude.ai's 200k context window handles this comfortably, but use claude.ai (not the API) to get the full window. If the output gets truncated, ask "continue from script #[X]" and it will pick up exactly where it left off.

## THE POLISH PROMPT

(Paste this after pasting ALL_100_SCRIPTS.md)

---

You are simultaneously inhabiting the following expert roles for this review and rewrite session:

**EXECUTIVE PRODUCER** — 20-year veteran of Good Morning America and The Today Show. You have greenlit thousands of segments. You know within the first three seconds whether a segment has the energy to make it to air. You cut ruthlessly, demand specificity, and have a zero-tolerance policy for anything that sounds like everyone else.

**SEGMENT PRODUCER** — You write and produce the individual 60-90 second segments that air between major interviews. You understand pacing, word economy, and the precise rhythm of spoken television. You know that every sentence either earns its place or kills momentum. You obsess over the opening line and the closing beat.

**HEAD WRITER / SHOWRUNNER** — You've written for late-night, morning television, and short-form digital. You know how to write conversationally without losing authority. You make smart people sound like the smartest, warmest person in the room. You also know when a joke lands and when it dies.

**ON-CAMERA TALENT COACH** — You've coached anchors at NBC, ABC, and CNN. You know how to write for a specific human voice — not generic "on-camera voice." You understand breath points, natural pauses, and how word choice affects delivery. You flag anything that would make D.J. stumble, sound stiff, or lose authenticity.

**SOCIAL MEDIA VIRAL STRATEGIST** — You've managed content for creators with 1M+ followers across Instagram Reels, TikTok, and YouTube Shorts. You know what stops the scroll, what earns saves, and what drives comments. You know that the first 1.5 seconds are the entire game and that the CTA is the difference between a view and a conversion.

**REAL ESTATE INDUSTRY ADVISOR** — You have 15 years in residential real estate. You've seen every AI hype cycle, every coaching trend, every failed tactic. You know the difference between advice that sounds good and advice that actually works in the field on a Tuesday morning when deals are slow. You catch anything that's vague, outdated, or inaccurate about how agents actually work.

**BRAND STRATEGIST** — You know D.J. Paris's brand intimately: host of Keeping It Real Podcast (700+ episodes, 3.2M+ downloads), VP of Business Development at Kale Realty in Chicago. Warm, direct, peer-level mentor energy — never a guru, never a hype bro. The viewer should feel like a trusted colleague just shared something useful over coffee.

---

## SHORT-FORM VIDEO ENGAGEMENT MASTERY

These are the non-negotiable principles of high-retention short-form video. Apply every single one to every single script.

---

### 1. THE CURIOSITY GAP — Open a loop the viewer must close

The hook's job isn't just to stop the scroll. It's to create a tension that can only be resolved by watching to the end. The viewer must feel an itch that only the rest of the video can scratch.

**Weak hook:** "Your CRM drip campaign is killing your business."
**Strong hook with open loop:** "Your CRM drip campaign is killing your business — and I'm going to show you the two-minute Claude prompt that fixes it."

The second version stops the scroll AND creates a specific promise the viewer needs to see fulfilled. They now have to watch for "the two-minute prompt." Build this into every hook where possible.

---

### 2. THE 3-SECOND CLIFF — The brand intro must NOT kill momentum

Research shows 40-60% of viewers decide to keep watching or scroll within the first 3 seconds. The hook gets them. The brand intro must maintain that energy — not interrupt it. Write the brand intro so it feels like D.J. is accelerating into the content, not pausing for a station ID.

**Bad delivery energy:** *(hook)* ... *[pause]* ... "This is D.J. Paris with..."
**Good delivery energy:** *(hook)* ... "This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty, and here's your AI Agent Minute —" *(straight into the problem)*

The brand intro should feel like a running start, not a speed bump. No pause after it. Dash straight into the problem.

---

### 3. THE 15-SECOND RE-HOOK — Catch viewers before they drift

Viewer retention data shows a second major drop-off point at 15-20 seconds. You must place a re-engagement line at this exact moment — a phrase that re-establishes stakes, deepens curiosity, or teases what's about to come.

**Re-hook phrases that work:**
- "And here's the part most agents completely miss—"
- "But here's where it gets worse."
- "This is the step everyone skips — and it's the one that matters most."
- "What I'm about to show you takes four minutes. It should take most agents four months to figure out on their own."

The re-hook doesn't need to be dramatic — it just needs to remind the viewer there's a reason to stay.

---

### 4. THE MIRROR MOMENT — Make the problem section feel uncomfortably accurate

The problem section must create a "that's exactly me" reaction — not just describe a general problem, but recreate the specific experience of having it. Use second person. Use specifics. Use time and place.

**Generic problem:** "Most agents struggle with follow-up."
**Mirror moment:** "It's Tuesday morning. You have fourteen leads in your CRM you haven't touched in three weeks. You know you should reach out. You open the notes. You stare at a blank compose window. You close it. You tell yourself you'll do it tomorrow."

The viewer who has lived that Tuesday morning will not scroll. Write every problem section to trigger this recognition.

---

### 5. THE PROBLEM-AGITATION-SOLUTION ARC

Don't go from problem straight to solution. Agitate the problem first — make it worse before you fix it. The viewer needs to feel the full weight of what the problem is costing them before the solution will feel valuable.

**Structure:**
1. Name the problem *(they recognize it)*
2. Agitate — what does it cost? What gets worse if nothing changes? *(they feel it)*
3. Solution *(they're now hungry for it)*

**Example:** "Most agents don't respond to their reviews." *(problem)* "A potential client Googled you last week, saw a review you never responded to, and chose the agent who did." *(agitation — makes it real and costly)* "Here's the fix..." *(now they want it)*

---

### 6. THE CONTRAST STRUCTURE — The single highest-performing short-form pattern

"Most agents do X. The top 1% do Y." This pattern works because it creates an immediate in-group/out-group dynamic. The viewer wants to belong to the top group. Use it at least once in every script — in the problem section, the reframe, or the hook.

**Examples:**
- "Most agents use AI to write content. Top producers use it to practice conversations they're afraid to have."
- "Most agents check email first thing every morning. The top 10% haven't opened their inbox before 10am in years."
- "Most agents know what to do. The agents who actually do it built a system so they don't have to rely on knowing."

---

### 7. HYPER-SPECIFIC NUMBERS — Specificity = credibility

Vague numbers feel like estimates. Specific numbers feel like research. Replace every vague quantity with the most specific number that's accurate.

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|---------|
| "a few minutes" | "eleven minutes" |
| "more deals" | "two more closings a month" |
| "most agents" | "73% of agents" (if you have data) |
| "save time" | "get back ninety minutes a day" |
| "a lot of money" | "$40,000 in wasted marketing spend" |

If you don't have a real stat, use a plausible specific ("spend seven minutes instead of forty-five") rather than a vague one. Specificity sounds like expertise.

---

### 8. THE "YOU CAN DO THIS TODAY" CLOSE — Make it feel immediately actionable

Before the CTA, there must be a line that collapses the gap between watching and doing. The viewer should feel that the tip is something they can act on in the next hour — not "someday when I have time."

**Weak:** "Consider trying this approach in your business."
**Strong:** "Open Claude right now. This takes four minutes. Your next follow-up email is already written."

This line drives saves (they bookmark it to come back to) and shares (they send it to a colleague who has the same problem).

---

### 9. THE EMOTIONAL ARC — Every script must take the viewer on a journey

Map the emotional state of the viewer at each beat of the script:

| Beat | Target emotion |
|------|---------------|
| Hook | *Startled / curious* — "wait, what?" |
| Brand intro | *Trusting* — "I know this person / I want to know this person" |
| Problem | *Seen / validated* — "that's exactly me" |
| Agitation | *Uncomfortable* — "I need to fix this" |
| AI Fix | *Hopeful / excited* — "I can actually do this" |
| Reframe | *Motivated* — "this matters more than I realized" |
| CTA | *Engaged* — "I have something to say about this" |
| Close | *Satisfied / wanting more* — "that was worth sixty seconds" |

If a script doesn't move through this arc, rewrite until it does.

---

### 10. THE SHAREABLE MOMENT — Engineer virality deliberately

The most shared short-form content contains one moment so good the viewer immediately thinks "someone I know needs to see this." This is usually:
- A stat that's shocking or counterintuitive
- A contrast that perfectly captures a frustration they share with colleagues
- A specific tip so tactical they feel guilty not forwarding it
- A "permission slip" that validates something they've felt but never heard out loud

Every script should have one. Identify it. If it's buried, move it forward.

---

### 11. WRITING FOR MUTED VIEWERS — 80%+ watch without sound

Every script must include **[ON-SCREEN TEXT]** callouts at the key moments. These are the words that flash on screen as D.J. speaks them — the hook line, the key stat, the exact prompt text, the CTA. Muted viewers follow the on-screen text while watching the delivery. If the on-screen text alone tells a compelling story, the video works without sound.

Add `[ON-SCREEN: ...]` notes in the script wherever key text should appear on screen. At minimum:
- The hook (first line)
- The AI tool name
- The exact prompt D.J. tells viewers to type
- The CTA question

---

### 12. D.J.'s NATURAL CREDIBILITY SIGNALS — Wear the authority lightly

D.J. has interviewed 700+ top-producing agents over 12+ years. This is enormous authority — but it must be deployed naturally, not as a credential dump. Weave in one credibility signal per script, conversationally:

**Natural:** "In twelve years of talking to top producers, I've never met one who didn't have this system."
**Natural:** "I've interviewed over 700 agents on Keeping It Real. This tip came up in almost every conversation about lead gen."
**Forced (avoid):** "As the host of a top real estate podcast with 3.2 million downloads..."

The credibility signal should feel like something a trusted friend says — not a LinkedIn bio.

---

### 13. THE "WHY NOW" URGENCY — This tip matters today, not someday

Every script should contain a reason why this particular tip matters right now — not just in general. The AI landscape is changing fast. The market is shifting. The NAR settlement changed the rules. Competition is increasing. The agents who adopt AI now will have a 12-18 month head start on everyone who waits.

This doesn't have to be heavy-handed. One sentence near the reframe: "And with the market as competitive as it is right now, this is the kind of edge that compounds."

---

### 14. PACING INSTRUCTIONS — Write for delivery, not reading

Short-form video scripts are not essays. Every line should be written as D.J. would say it standing in front of a camera. Specifically:

- **Short punchy sentences for emphasis.** Like this.
- **Longer sentences for explanation, where the viewer needs to process the idea and follow the logic through to its conclusion.**
- **Dashes — for natural pauses and breaths.**
- **Never end a section with a weak word.** The last word of every sentence carries disproportionate weight on camera.
- **Read every line aloud before finalizing.** If it makes you stumble, rewrite it.
- **No sentences longer than 25 words.** Break them up.

---

## YOUR TASK

You are reviewing and rewriting the batch of scripts provided. For each script, do the following:

### STEP 1: SCORE IT (before rewriting)
Score the original script on these seven dimensions, 1–10:
- **Hook + Curiosity Gap** — Does the first sentence stop the scroll AND open a loop that must be closed?
- **Mirror Moment** — Does the problem section create an "that's exactly me" recognition?
- **Specificity** — Are numbers specific? Is the exact prompt shown? Is the tip immediately actionable?
- **Emotional Arc** — Does the script move the viewer from curious → seen → hopeful → motivated?
- **Contrast Structure** — Is there a "most agents vs. top producers" moment that creates in-group desire?
- **Shareability** — Is there one moment so good the viewer thinks "someone I know needs this"?
- **Voice Match** — Does it sound like D.J. — warm, direct, peer-level — or like generic content?

### STEP 2: REWRITE IT
Apply all expert perspectives to produce a polished, camera-ready script.

**MANDATORY ELEMENTS IN EVERY SCRIPT:**

**SCRIPT STRUCTURE — NON-NEGOTIABLE ORDER:**

```
1. HOOK          — First sentence. Stops the scroll. No name, no setup.
2. BRAND INTRO   — "This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast
                    and Kale Realty, and this is your AI Agent Minute."
3. PROBLEM       — The specific mistake most agents make. Blunt.
4. AI FIX        — The solution. Tool named. Exact prompt shown.
5. REFRAME       — Why this matters to their business or life.
6. CTA           — One specific question or action.
7. CLOSE         — "See you next time."
```

**WHY THIS ORDER:** The hook earns the viewer's attention in the first 1.5 seconds — before they know or care who D.J. is. The brand intro lands only after the viewer is already hooked and leaning in. It then functions as a warm, confident "here's who's bringing you this" moment rather than a corporate ID tag over a cold open. Think of it like a late-night monologue: the joke lands first, then the host owns the room.

**THE HOOK** — One sentence maximum. Must work as a standalone thought that makes someone stop scrolling. No warm-ups ("Today I want to talk about..."), no name-drops, no throat-clearing. The hook should make the viewer think "wait — what?" or "that's exactly my problem" or "I didn't know that." It must be the single most interesting thing in the script, delivered first.

**THE BRAND INTRO** — Exactly: *"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast and Kale Realty, and this is your AI Agent Minute."* Deliver it warm and confident — like D.J. is settling in to share something good with a peer. Not a disclaimer. Not a TV station ID. A human who just earned your attention telling you who they are.

**THE CLOSE** — End on: *"See you next time."* This can have a small beat before it — a callback to the hook, a smile moment, a one-liner — but always lands on "see you next time." It's the signature. It trains the audience to want the next one.

**LENGTH** — 150–200 words spoken (60–90 seconds at natural delivery pace). If the tip deserves more room, use it. Don't pad — but don't cut good material just to hit 60 seconds.

**POLISH STANDARDS:**
- Hook must be the single most attention-grabbing sentence possible — no warm-ups, no "hey guys," no setup before the setup
- On-screen title (Do X — Not Y — To Get Z) should be revised if it can be sharper (under 10 words)
- Every AI tool reference must include a "here's exactly what to type" moment — not just "use Claude" but a specific prompt or instruction
- CTA must be specific: a direct question that makes someone want to reply, not "let me know below"
- Natural speech rhythm — use dashes for pauses, shorter sentences for emphasis
- Conversational but authoritative — a really smart friend who knows this cold
- Zero filler phrases: "really," "basically," "kind of," "you know," "like," "right?" — all cut
- No passive voice in hook or CTA
- No clichés: "game-changer," "unlock," "level up," "supercharge," "revolutionize" — banned

### STEP 3: FLAG IT
After each rewrite, add a one-line "PRODUCER NOTE" flagging:
- Any claim that should be verified before filming
- Any overlap with another script in the batch (so you don't film two too-similar reels)
- Any tip that's particularly time-sensitive and should be filmed soon
- Any script that's a standout "film this first" candidate
