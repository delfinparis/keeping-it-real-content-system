# Reels Scorecard — Week 1 Review

## Rating Scale: 1-10

---

## Video 1 — Kitchen Selfie (67s)
**Topic:** Agents doubling down / what top agents do differently

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Fun | 4/10 | Earnest but flat energy. The emoji overlays (🏆⏳🤔) try to compensate but feel bolted on |
| Excitement | 3/10 | Static kitchen background, single camera angle, no visual changes for 67 seconds |
| Effectiveness | 5/10 | The message is solid — top agents commit to consistency. But the delivery doesn't match the urgency of the point |
| Interestingness | 4/10 | No hook, no pattern interrupt, no reason for a scroller to stop |
| Engagement | 3/10 | At 67s with zero visual variety, you're losing most viewers by second 8 |

**Overall: 3.8/10**

**Biggest problem:** This looks like a FaceTime call, not content. Kitchen cabinets, harsh overhead lighting, too-close framing. The caption style (bold yellow/green with emojis) is the most energetic thing in the frame, which creates a mismatch.

## Video 2 — Studio / Commission Talk (81s)
**Topic:** Commission structure / keeping more of your deal

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Fun | 4/10 | Low-key delivery. The content is relevant but presented like a lecture |
| Excitement | 4/10 | Studio setup is clean but same single angle for 81 seconds |
| Effectiveness | 6/10 | Strong value prop content — agents care about commission splits. This actually says something useful |
| Interestingness | 5/10 | The studio + orange mic + Kale branding looks professional. But still just a talking head |
| Engagement | 4/10 | Way too long at 81 seconds for a single static shot. 30-40s max for this format |

**Overall: 4.6/10**

**What's working:** The studio setup is your best look. Orange mic pops. Kale Realty branding visible. You look like someone worth listening to in this setting. **What's not:** The length is killing your completion rate, which tanks algorithmic reach.

## Video 3 — B-Roll Opener / Open House Tips (51s)
**Topic:** Open house prep tips (pillows in trunk, staging details)

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Fun | 6/10 | The b-roll of pillows in a trunk is unexpected and creates curiosity |
| Excitement | 6/10 | Multiple visual elements — b-roll cut to studio. This is actual editing |
| Effectiveness | 7/10 | Practical, specific advice agents can use immediately. Referencing Amanda Pendleton adds credibility |
| Interestingness | 7/10 | Opening with a visual that's NOT your face is the right instinct. Forces people to ask "what am I looking at?" |
| Engagement | 6/10 | Shortest video (51s) and most visually dynamic. Best completion rate of the five |

**Overall: 6.4/10** ⭐ Best of the batch

**Why this works:** You broke the pattern. B-roll opener → studio payoff. Multiple shots. Specific tip. Shorter runtime. This is the template to build from. The wider studio angle with the full Kale Realty sign and plants also looks better than the tight crop in Videos 2 and 5.

## Video 4 — Purple Room / Lead Follow-Up (89s)
**Topic:** Lead follow-up systems, how leads get called

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Fun | 3/10 | The purple/blue lighting is moody but the energy doesn't match it |
| Excitement | 3/10 | Longest video (89 seconds), single static shot, gray t-shirt blends into the background |
| Effectiveness | 5/10 | Lead follow-up is a critical topic for agents, but the delivery feels like mid-podcast ramble, not reel-optimized content |
| Interestingness | 4/10 | The lighting setup is different, which is something, but it's not enough variety for 89 seconds |
| Engagement | 2/10 | 89 seconds of one angle is a death sentence for retention. The algorithm will bury this |

**Overall: 3.4/10**

**Biggest problem:** This feels like you pressed record, talked for 90 seconds, and posted. Reels reward tight editing and punchy delivery. This needs to be cut in half at minimum, or broken into 2-3 separate reels.

## Video 5 — Email Critique / Tammy Grayson (71s)
**Topic:** Reviewing/critiquing a real agent's email strategy

| Category | Score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Fun | 6/10 | There's inherent entertainment in watching someone get constructively critiqued |
| Excitement | 5/10 | The screen capture of the actual email is a real pattern interrupt |
| Effectiveness | 7/10 | Agents LOVE seeing real examples broken down. This teaches by showing, not telling |
| Interestingness | 7/10 | The "critique a real agent's work" format is inherently compelling. People watch to see if they'd make the same mistakes |
| Engagement | 6/10 | The email screenshot forces a pause. Different caption style (white rounded box) also signals something different |

**Overall: 6.2/10** ⭐ Second best

**Why this works:** You accidentally found a format. The "let me show you this and break it down" structure is proven on every platform. This is Simon Sinek-meets-Gordon Ramsay energy — review real work, give honest feedback, teach a lesson. The visual variety of face → email screenshot → face creates natural cuts.

## Cross-Video Patterns

### What's Working
1. **The orange mic** is a signature visual element. Keep it in every video.
2. **The Kale Realty studio** is your strongest setting. The branding is subtle but present.
3. **Your knowledge is the asset** — you've talked to 700+ top producers. That credibility comes through when you reference specifics.
4. **Videos 3 and 5 both break the visual monotony** and they're your two best performers. That's not a coincidence.

### What Needs to Change Immediately

**1. LENGTH — Cut everything to 30-45 seconds max.**
Your videos are 51-89 seconds. For reels, especially from a newer account with no established audience, 30-45 seconds is the sweet spot. Shorter = higher completion rate = the algorithm shows it to more people. You can always do a "Part 2" — that actually HELPS engagement.

**2. THE HOOK — First 1.5 seconds need to stop the scroll.**
None of these five videos have a real hook. You should open with either a bold claim, a question, or a visual that creates curiosity. Examples:
- "The #1 reason agents leave their brokerage..." (then pause)
- A screenshot of something wild, then cut to you reacting
- "This email from a Keller Williams agent is actually brilliant. Here's why."

**3. VISUAL VARIETY — Never go more than 5-7 seconds on one shot.**
Top reels creators cut every 3-5 seconds. You don't need fancy transitions — just alternate between tight face shot, wider shot, b-roll, text cards, screenshots, or even just zooming in/out slightly. Video 3 proved you can do this.

**4. DITCH THE KITCHEN.**
Video 1 at home looks amateur compared to your studio setup. If you must shoot at home, find a cleaner background, use a ring light, and frame yourself from chest up with some headroom.

**5. CAPTION STYLE — Pick one and commit.**
You used three different caption styles across five videos: bold yellow/green with emojis, plain white bold, and white rounded boxes. Pick one style and make it your brand. The white rounded box style from Video 5 is the cleanest.

**6. ENERGY — You're at a 4, reels need a 7.**
You sound like you're having a conversation. That's great for a podcast. For reels, you need 30-40% more vocal energy, faster pacing, and more deliberate emphasis on key words. Watch how Gary Vee or Tom Ferry deliver the same type of content — they're not yelling, but they're *leaning in*.

## Your Best Format (Double Down on This)

**The "Real Agent Review"** format from Video 5 is your goldmine. Here's why:

1. You have unique access to 800+ agents and 700+ podcast episodes of strategies
2. It's inherently visual (show the email/listing/strategy, then react)
3. It creates engagement because people either agree or disagree with your take
4. It positions you as an authority without you having to say "I'm an authority"
5. It naturally showcases what Kale Realty offers without being salesy

**Template for your next 10 reels:**
- 0-2s: Screen capture or bold text card with the hook
- 2-5s: Quick context ("This agent sent this email to her entire database...")
- 5-25s: Your breakdown with 2-3 cuts between you and the example
- 25-30s: The takeaway + CTA

## Priority Actions for Week 2

1. Record 3 "Real Agent Review" reels using the template above (30-35 seconds each)
2. Always shoot in the studio with the orange mic and Kale branding
3. Write your hook FIRST, before you record anything
4. Add 2-3 b-roll cuts or screen captures to every single video
5. Watch your 5 videos back at 2x speed — if YOU get bored, your audience definitely will
