## PHASE 0: Project Setup (1 minute)

1. Open CapCut Desktop, click **Create project**
2. Your project defaults to 9:16 (vertical). If not, click the aspect ratio dropdown above the preview and select **9:16**
3. Click **Import** (top left) or drag your raw video file into the media panel
4. Drag the clip from the media panel down onto the **main video track** on the timeline
5. Delete the CapCut default outro clip at the end of the timeline — click it, press Delete

## PHASE 1: Rough Cut — Remove the Garbage (3-5 minutes)

**Goal:** Turn your raw 2-3 minute recording into a tight 90 seconds.

**How to see what to cut:** Zoom into the timeline using Ctrl+scroll wheel until you can see the audio waveform on your clip. Flat lines = silence. Tall spikes = you talking. You want to remove all the flat dead air, plus any sections where you stumbled, repeated yourself, or said something weak.

### Step by step:

1. Move playhead to the very beginning (press Home key or drag it)
2. Press **Spacebar** to play
3. When you hear a bad section starting (pause, "um," false start, weak sentence), press **Spacebar** to stop
4. Use **← →** arrow keys to nudge the playhead to the exact start of the bad section
5. Press **Ctrl+B** to split
6. Press **Spacebar** to play again, find the end of the bad section
7. Press **Spacebar** to stop, nudge with arrows, press **Ctrl+B** to split again
8. Click the bad section between the two splits — it highlights blue
9. Press **Delete** — the timeline snaps closed
10. Repeat until you've gone through the entire clip

### What to cut:
- Every "um," "uh," "you know," "so," "like" that doesn't serve the sentence
- Pauses longer than 0.3 seconds between sentences
- Any sentence where you repeated the same point you already made
- False starts where you began a thought and restarted
- Throat clears, lip smacks, deep breaths (if obvious)

### What to keep:
- Clean, complete sentences
- Natural micro-pauses between distinct thoughts (0.2-0.3s is fine)
- Moments where your energy spikes — lean into those

### Rough cut checkpoint:
Play it back from the start. You should now have approximately 85-95 seconds of clean content. If you're over 95 seconds, make another pass and cut the weakest point you made. If you're under 80, you may have cut too aggressively — Ctrl+Z to undo.

## PHASE 2: Jump Cut Zooms — Create Visual Energy (3-4 minutes)

**Goal:** Alternate between your normal framing (100% scale) and a tighter "zoomed" framing (115-120% scale) every 5-8 seconds so it looks like a multi-camera shoot.

### Step by step:

1. Move playhead to the beginning
2. Your first clip stays at 100% scale — don't touch it
3. Move playhead to approximately 5-7 seconds in. Find a spot between sentences or at a natural thought break
4. Press **Ctrl+B** to split
5. **Click the SECOND clip** (the one after the split) to select it
6. Look at the **top-right panel**. Click the **Video** tab, then **Basic**
7. Find **Scale** — change it from **100** to **118** (drag the slider or type the number)
8. Find **Position** — adjust the **X** and **Y** values to re-center your face in the frame. Your eyes should sit roughly in the upper third. Nudge until it looks right in the preview window
9. Move playhead another 5-7 seconds forward, press **Ctrl+B** to split again
10. Click the THIRD clip — leave this one at **100** (it resets automatically since it's part of the original clip, but verify)
11. Continue alternating: **100 → 118 → 100 → 118 → 100...**

### Scale values that work:

| Shot | Scale | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| Normal (wide) | 100 | Default framing, every other clip |
| Medium zoom | 115-118 | Standard alternating zoom |
| Tight punch-in | 125-130 | Use once per reel for your single most important sentence |

### Common mistakes:
- **Forgetting to adjust Position after zooming** — your forehead will be cut off or you'll be off-center. Always check the preview
- **Zooming to the same value every time** — mix it up slightly. 115 on one, 120 on the next. Keeps it from feeling mechanical
- **Splitting mid-word** — always split between sentences, never in the middle of a word. The zoom change should happen when you'd naturally blink

### Jump cut zoom checkpoint:
Play it back. You should see 12-18 visual changes across your 90-second reel. It should feel like you filmed with two cameras even though you didn't. If any cut feels jarring, nudge the split point a few frames with the arrow keys.

## PHASE 3: One Slow Zoom (Optional — 1 minute)

**Goal:** Add one smooth push-in during the single most important sentence in your reel for dramatic emphasis.

### Step by step:

1. Identify the clip where you deliver your key takeaway
2. Click that clip to select it
3. Move the playhead to the START of that sentence
4. In the right panel: **Video > Basic > Scale** — click the **diamond icon** (⬥) next to Scale. This drops a keyframe at your current scale value (100 or 118, wherever you are)
5. Move the playhead forward **4-6 seconds** to the END of that sentence
6. Change the Scale value to **10-15 points higher** than where you started (e.g., 100→112, or 118→130)
7. CapCut automatically creates a second keyframe and animates between them
8. To verify: press **Alt+K** (Win) or **Option+K** (Mac) to show keyframes on the timeline. You should see two diamond markers on that clip

### When to use this vs. jump cut zoom:
- Jump cut zoom = energy, pace, "multi-camera" feel — use 12-18 times per reel
- Slow push-in = emphasis, gravitas, "listen to THIS" — use once per reel, maybe twice max

## PHASE 4: Auto Captions (2-3 minutes)

**Goal:** Add synced captions so your reel works with sound off.

### Step by step:

1. Click **Text** in the top toolbar
2. Click **Auto captions**
3. Click **Create** — CapCut will analyze your audio and generate word-by-word captions
4. Wait for processing (usually 15-30 seconds)
5. Once generated, captions appear on the timeline as a separate track

### Style your captions (do this once, then save as template):

1. Click on any caption block on the timeline
2. In the right panel, adjust:
   - **Font:** Use a clean sans-serif (Inter, Montserrat, or Arial Black all work). Avoid script or decorative fonts
   - **Size:** 8-10 works for most vertical videos. Needs to be readable on a phone screen
   - **Color:** White text with a black outline or dark shadow for readability on any background
   - **Position:** Lower third of the screen, centered. Leave enough room below for Instagram's UI elements (like, comment, share buttons)
   - **Style:** Pick the preset closest to what you want, then customize. The clean white-on-dark-background style works best for professional content. Avoid the flashy animated styles
3. After styling, click **Apply to all** so every caption block matches

### Fix transcription errors:

1. Scroll through the caption timeline and read each block
2. Double-click any caption to edit the text
3. Common errors: proper nouns (Kale Realty, Courted.ai, agent names), industry jargon, numbers
4. Fix them manually — takes 60-90 seconds

### Caption checkpoint:
Play the reel with sound off. Can you follow the entire message just from captions? If any caption is on screen too briefly to read, check if CapCut split it oddly and merge or adjust the timing.

## PHASE 5: Hook Text (1 minute)

**Goal:** Add a bold text overlay in the first 1-2 seconds that tells viewers what they're about to learn.

### Step by step:

1. Click **Text** in the top toolbar
2. Click **Default text** or choose a text template
3. Type your hook — examples for realtor content:
   - "The open house trick nobody talks about"
   - "Stop losing commission on every deal"
   - "This email template books 3x more appointments"
   - "Why your brokerage is taking too much of your money"
4. In the right panel, style it:
   - Large, bold, centered
   - High contrast (white on your dark studio background works)
   - Position: center or upper-center of the frame
5. On the timeline, drag the text element so it starts at second 0 and ends around second 1.5-2.0
6. The hook text should disappear right as you begin your first sentence

### Optional — add a second text element:
At the very end (last 2-3 seconds), add a CTA text like "Follow for more agent tips" or "Link in bio for the full breakdown." Same styling as the hook.

## Week 1-2 Progression Plan

**Reels 1-3:** Just do Phases 0, 1, 4, and 6. Cuts + captions only. Get comfortable with Ctrl+B splitting and the rhythm of play-stop-split-delete. Don't even think about zooms yet.

**Reels 4-7:** Add Phase 2 (jump cut zooms). This is where the visual quality jumps dramatically. You'll feel slow at first — that's normal. By reel 7 you'll be doing it in 3 minutes.

**Reels 8-10:** Add Phases 3 and 5 (slow zoom + hook text). Now you're producing fully polished content.

**After reel 10:** Start adding b-roll overlays and screenshots (drag images/screen recordings to the track ABOVE your main video). This is what made your Videos 3 and 5 your best performers.
