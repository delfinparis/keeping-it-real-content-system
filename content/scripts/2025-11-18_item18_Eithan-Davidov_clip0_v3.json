  "polished_script": "HOOK: The agent closing 100 deals a year just told me don't grow your team. [ON-SCREEN: 100 DEALS/YEAR: \"DON'T GROW\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're probably thinking about hiring right now. Maybe you closed 30 deals last year, you're feeling confident, and that LinkedIn algorithm keeps showing you posts about \"scaling fast\" and \"building your empire.\" [ON-SCREEN: YOU: READY TO HIRE?] So I asked Eithan Davidov — who runs one of the top teams in Queens — about scaling up.\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: His answer goes against everything you see on social media.\n\nINSIGHT: Quote: \"Don't grow too fast. You don't want to bite off more than you can chew.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"DON'T GROW TOO FAST\"] Here's what he means. Every agent you add isn't just another producer — it's another person who needs training, systems, leads, and your time. [ON-SCREEN: 1 AGENT = TRAINING + SYSTEMS + LEADS + TIME] He's watched teams implode because they hired 5 agents when they only had infrastructure for 2. [ON-SCREEN: HIRED 5, INFRASTRUCTURE FOR 2] The deals dried up, service quality tanked, and the team leader became a full-time babysitter instead of a rainmaker.\n\nREFRAME: So before you post that \"we're hiring\" ad, ask yourself: Do I have the systems to support another human? Most agents hire to look bigger. Top producers hire when they're actually ready. You can assess this today — look at your current systems, your lead flow, your time capacity.\n\nCTA: \"What's the one system you need before your next hire?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The top Queens agent who closes 100 deals/year says don't grow your team. Here's why most agents get scaling completely wrong.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #TeamBuilding #RealEstateAgent #Scaling #RealEstateTips\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Every agent you add isn't just another producer — it's another person who needs training, systems, leads, and your time.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. HOOK delivery: Lean forward, surprised tone on \"just told me\" — make it feel like breaking news\n2. INSIGHT pacing: Slow down on the quote, then build urgency through the infrastructure breakdown\n3. Eye contact: Direct camera look during \"ask yourself\" moment in REFRAME for personal connection",
