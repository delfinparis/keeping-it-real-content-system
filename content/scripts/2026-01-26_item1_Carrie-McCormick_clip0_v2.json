Every data point you have, they have. They don't need you to move fast — they need you to interpret clearly. Carrie's not racing to answer listing questions anymore. She's reframing them. 'Should we price at $1.2M?' becomes 'Here's what $1.2M signals to the three buyer profiles watching this neighborhood.' Pricing isn't a number — it's a positioning statement. And the agents who can translate noise into narrative? Those are the ones clients call back.",
