  "polished_script": "HOOK: You're not failing because your strategy is wrong. You're failing because you won't stop switching. [ON-SCREEN: \"STOP SWITCHING STRATEGIES\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You've tried Facebook ads, door knocking, open houses, cold calling. Each time you switch after three months because \"it's not working.\" Meanwhile, you're watching other agents crush it with the exact same methods you abandoned. Sound familiar? [ON-SCREEN: \"SOUND FAMILIAR?\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Garrett Maroon figured out that most agents never will.\n\nINSIGHT: Garrett built a top 1% business in Southeast Virginia by picking ONE lead source in 2018 and never switching. That source? His past client database. [ON-SCREEN: \"ONE LEAD SOURCE SINCE 2018\"] Month six: three referrals. Most agents would've panicked and bought Zillow leads. Month twelve: eight referrals. [ON-SCREEN: \"MONTH 12: 8 REFERRALS\"] Month eighteen: seventeen. By month twenty-four, he stopped prospecting entirely because his database became a referral machine. [ON-SCREEN: \"MONTH 24: STOPPED PROSPECTING\"] His exact words: \"Pick a path and stay there long enough until it works.\"\n\nREFRAME: Your database doesn't trust you because you haven't been consistent long enough. The compound effect only kicks in when you stop restarting. Consistency isn't sexy, but it's the only thing that builds trust.\n\nCTA: \"Are you finally ready to pick one strategy and stick with it for 18 months — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop switching strategies every 3 months. Pick one path and stay there long enough until it works. Consistency beats perfection every time.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateSuccess #AgentTips #DatabaseMarketing #Consistency #ReferralBusiness\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"The compound effect only kicks in when you stop restarting.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. HOOK delivery: Start with slight frustration in voice, emphasize \"won't stop switching\"\n2. During INSIGHT: Slow down on the monthly progression numbers for impact\n3. REFRAME: Lean forward slightly, more intimate tone on \"consistency isn't sexy\" line",
