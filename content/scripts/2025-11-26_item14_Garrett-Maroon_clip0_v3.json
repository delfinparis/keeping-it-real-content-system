  "polished_script": "HOOK: You're not failing because you picked the wrong strategy. [ON-SCREEN: \"It's not your strategy...\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Garrett Maroon built a top 1% business in Southeast Virginia. And when struggling agents ask him what finally worked, his answer makes them mad. [ON-SCREEN: \"TOP 1% AGENT\"] Because you've tried everything, right? Cold calling for two months. Facebook ads for six weeks. Video content for a month. Door knocking until it felt awkward. Instagram reels until the algorithm changed. You keep switching strategies wondering why nothing sticks.\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Garrett told me that no one wants to hear.\n\nINSIGHT: He said: \"Pick a path and stay there long enough until it works.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"PICK A PATH & STAY\"] That's it. Not the perfect CRM. Not the hottest lead source. Not the newest AI tool. Just one strategy — relationships, door knocking, video, whatever — and the discipline to not jump ship when it feels hard at month three. [ON-SCREEN: \"12 MONTHS NOT 12 WEEKS\"] Because here's the truth: every strategy works if you give it twelve months. Almost no strategy works if you give it twelve weeks.\n\nREFRAME: The top producers aren't smarter or more talented than you. They just stopped switching. [ON-SCREEN: \"THEY STOPPED SWITCHING\"] They picked their path and stayed long enough to master it. You can start this today — just pick one thing and commit.\n\nCTA: \"What's the one strategy you're committing to for the next twelve months?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop switching strategies every few months. Top agents pick ONE path and stick with it for 12 months minimum. What's your path?\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorTips #KeepingItReal #RealEstateAgent #TopProducer\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Every strategy works if you give it twelve months. Almost no strategy works if you give it twelve weeks.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. HOOK delivery: Pause after \"failing\" for emphasis, slight lean forward on camera\n2. INSIGHT section: Slow down on the 12 months vs 12 weeks contrast — let it land\n3. CTA: Direct eye contact, genuine curiosity tone — like asking a friend, not selling",
