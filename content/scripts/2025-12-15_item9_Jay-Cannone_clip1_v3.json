  "polished_script": "HOOK: If you're chasing clients, you're doing it backwards. [ON-SCREEN: \"Stop Chasing Clients\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know that feeling when you're constantly pitching, following up, convincing people who seem lukewarm at best? You're working twice as hard for half the results. Meanwhile, you see other agents who somehow have clients calling them, ready to buy. [ON-SCREEN: \"Why Are You Working So Hard?\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: Here's what Jay Cannone, top 1% luxury agent in Fairfield County, figured out years ago.\n\nINSIGHT: Jay's rule: \"Marketing is attracting. Selling is convincing.\" When you market right, clients come pre-sold. They've already consumed your content, they trust your expertise, they know your values. [ON-SCREEN: \"Marketing = Attracting\"] By the time they call you, you're not pitching — you're consulting. You're not overcoming objections — you're confirming what they already believe about you. [ON-SCREEN: \"Clients Call You Pre-Sold\"] The transaction becomes inevitable because the relationship was built before the meeting.\n\nREFRAME: Think about your last five deals right now. How many clients came to you versus how many did you have to convince? That ratio tells you everything. The more you attract, the less you exhaust yourself.\n\nCTA: \"List three things you do to attract versus convince — can you name three right now?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop chasing. Start attracting. Jay Cannone's approach to luxury real estate client acquisition 🎯\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateMarketing #LuxuryRealEstate #ClientAttraction #RealEstateTips #KeepingItRealPodcast\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Marketing is attracting. Selling is convincing.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver the hook with conviction and slight frustration in your voice\n2. Slow down and emphasize \"pre-sold\" — let that word land\n3. Make direct eye contact during the CTA question, as if genuinely asking each viewer",
