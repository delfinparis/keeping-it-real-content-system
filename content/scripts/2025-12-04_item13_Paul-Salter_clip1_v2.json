      "text": "Here's what happens: 40-hour weeks become 20. Then 10. You tell yourself 'the kids have a half day' or 'it's too cold' or 'no one's buying right now anyway.' All-or-nothing thinking kicks in. If you can't do a full day, you do nothing. You open your CRM just to feel productive, but you get jack shit done. Meanwhile, buyers and sellers who need to move yesterday are getting ignored. Paul calls it interest versus commitment. And here's the line that hits: 'If you're committed to your goal, the holidays, the weather, other people's actions leave you absolutely unfazed.'",
