  "polished_script": "HOOK: The $50 million producer still works $800 rentals. [ON-SCREEN: $50M agent works rentals]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You think taking small deals is what's keeping you stuck in the bottom tier. You're grinding through rentals and starter homes while watching other agents close luxury listings. So you decide — no more small fish. Time to go big or go home. [ON-SCREEN: \"No more small deals\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Kristee Leonard taught me about why that strategy actually kills your growth.\n\nINSIGHT: Kristee sells over $50 million a year in Austin — and she still takes rental clients. [ON-SCREEN: Kristee Leonard - $50M+ annually] Her exact words: \"If you choose to take on that client, then you need to represent them just like if they were a multimillion dollar deal.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Treat every client like a million dollar deal\"] One rental client from California turned into multiple referrals that fed her business for years. [ON-SCREEN: 1 rental → multiple referrals] She's not doing this to be nice — she's building a referral engine that compounds. The year she hit $50 million? She was still working rentals. [ON-SCREEN: $50M year + still doing rentals]\n\nREFRAME: You're not stuck because you're taking small deals. You're stuck because you're half-assing them while waiting for the big one. Every client is a referral source to your next ten deals — start treating them that way.\n\nCTA: \"Think about your last small client — did you give them the same energy as your biggest deal?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The $50M agent who still works rentals (this mindset shift changes everything)\n\nHASHTAGS: #realestate #realtor #realtorlife #realestateagent #luxuryrealestate\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You're not stuck because you're taking small deals. You're stuck because you're half-assing them while waiting for the big one.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver the hook with genuine surprise/disbelief in your voice\n2. Emphasize \"every client\" and \"multimillion dollar deal\" with conviction \n3. Lean forward slightly during the reframe for intimacy and directness",
