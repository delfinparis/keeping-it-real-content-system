  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your biggest strength is about to destroy your career. [ON-SCREEN: Your superpower = your kryptonite]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're the agent who outworks everyone. 60-hour weeks. 200 calls a day. More showings than your competition combined. It got you to the top 5% in your market. But now? You're making reactive decisions, saying yes to every lead, and you've completely lost the joy that made you love real estate in the first place. [ON-SCREEN: Top 5% but burning out]\n  [15-SEC RE-HOOK]: Here's what performance coach Paul Salter told me that changed everything.\n\nINSIGHT: \"Your superpower inevitably will become your kryptonite.\" That relentless work ethic that built your business? It's now a house of cards. [ON-SCREEN: \"Superpower = Kryptonite\" - Paul Salter] You're disconnected from your intuition, from what actually matters, and from the foundation that supports everything else. Most agents think more effort equals more success. Top producers who sustain success for decades know the real secret: they're not balanced — they're aligned. [ON-SCREEN: Not balanced. ALIGNED.]\n\nREFRAME: You can start building alignment today. Stop pouring everything into one area while your foundation crumbles. The agents earning 7 figures for 20+ years? They built empires that don't require sacrificing their health, relationships, or sanity.\n\nCTA: \"What's the one area of your life you've been neglecting that's actually the foundation of everything else?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Your biggest strength might be sabotaging your long-term success. Here's how top producers stay aligned, not just balanced. 💪\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateAgent #TopProducer #WorkLifeBalance #RealEstateTips #AgentBurnout\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Your superpower inevitably will become your kryptonite.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Deliver HOOK with concern/urgency, not excitement [2] Slow down and emphasize \"aligned\" vs \"balanced\" contrast [3] Lean into camera during final question for intimate connection",
