  "polished_script": "HOOK: Most agents aren't running a business — they're being run by one. [ON-SCREEN: Being run by your business?]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know the drill: wake up, check your phone, respond to clients, show houses, write contracts, collapse, repeat. That's not a business — that's a treadmill with a commission check. You're constantly busy but never in control. [ON-SCREEN: Sound familiar?]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But Garrett Maroon — top 1% in Southeast Virginia, all referrals — asked himself one question that changed everything.\n\nINSIGHT: \"Are we going to live on purpose or on accident?\" Most agents default to accident. They let the market set their schedule, clients dictate their boundaries, and 'busy' becomes their identity. [ON-SCREEN: \"Live on purpose or accident?\"] Garrett flipped the script entirely. He mapped his ideal week FIRST — family dinners, gym time, date nights — then built his client systems around that life. Not the other way around. [ON-SCREEN: Design life first, business second] The result? Fewer transactions, higher income, actual life outside real estate.\n\nREFRAME: Here's what nobody tells you: the agents who work the most aren't the ones who earn the most. The ones who design their business around their life stay in this game for decades without burning out. You're not lazy for wanting boundaries — you're strategic.\n\nCTA: \"So tell me — are you living on purpose or by accident right now?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Most agents are being run by their business instead of running it. Garrett Maroon's one question changed everything. 🎯\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateAgent #WorkLifeBalance #RealEstateTips #AgentLife #RealEstateBusiness\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"The agents who work the most aren't the ones who earn the most.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Emphasize \"being run by one\" in hook with slight pause before \"one\"\n2. Slow down and lean in during Garrett's quote — make it feel profound\n3. Direct eye contact during CTA question — make it personal and conversational",
