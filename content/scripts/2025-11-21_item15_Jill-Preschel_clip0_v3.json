  "polished_script": "HOOK: \"Do it now, ask for forgiveness later\" just cost me my biggest deal. [ON-SCREEN: \"Do it now, ask for forgiveness later\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know that moment when you think moving fast will impress your client, so you schedule the showing, send the offer, or make the introduction without checking first? [ON-SCREEN: Without checking first?] You're trying to show initiative. Prove you're on top of things. But with luxury clients especially, that speed can backfire in ways that cost you everything. \n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what a $2 billion luxury producer does differently.\n\nINSIGHT: Jill Preschel has closed over two billion in luxury real estate, and she'll tell you the move-fast-break-things mentality doesn't work when one conversation can make or break a seven-figure commission. [ON-SCREEN: $2 billion in sales] Here's her approach: before she makes any move with a developer or luxury buyer, she has the conversation first. [ON-SCREEN: Conversation FIRST] \"So much of what we do is nuanced and requires conversations before actions. Not after. Before.\" [ON-SCREEN: Before actions, not after] Because in luxury real estate, you don't get do-overs. One email sent too early, one showing scheduled without checking in, one assumption about what the client wants—that's all it takes to lose trust you'll never get back. [ON-SCREEN: No do-overs in luxury]\n\nREFRAME: The agents who close the biggest deals aren't the fastest—they're the ones who ask the right questions before they act. Speed without strategy is just expensive chaos. You can start doing this today.\n\nCTA: \"Before your next client move, ask yourself: what conversation am I skipping?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The \"move fast\" mentality that's costing agents their biggest deals. Luxury producer Jill Preschel ($2B in sales) shares what to do instead.\n\nHASHTAGS: #luxuryrealestate #realestatetips #clientrelations #realestateagent #keepingitreal\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Speed without strategy is just expensive chaos.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Pause after \"biggest deal\" in hook for emphasis and impact\n2. Slow down on the quote \"So much of what we do is nuanced...\" to let it land\n3. Eye contact intensity on \"you don't get do-overs\"—this is the emotional peak",
