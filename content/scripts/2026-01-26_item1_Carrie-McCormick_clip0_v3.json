  "polished_script": "HOOK: The agents closing the most deals right now? They're moving the slowest. [ON-SCREEN: SLOWEST = MOST DEALS?]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know that feeling when clients seem to know as much as you do? They've got Zillow estimates, ChatGPT pulling comps, every piece of data at their fingertips. And suddenly your quick responses aren't impressing anyone anymore. [ON-SCREEN: CLIENTS KNOW EVERYTHING NOW]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what $100 million producer Carrie McCormick figured out that most agents are missing.\n\nINSIGHT: She told me: \"Today's market is rewarding judgment over urgency. Buyers are slowing down.\" [ON-SCREEN: JUDGMENT > URGENCY] Carrie's not racing to answer \"Should we price at $1.2M?\" anymore. Instead, she reframes it: \"Here's what $1.2M signals to the three buyer profiles watching this neighborhood.\" [ON-SCREEN: PRICING = POSITIONING] She's not giving data — she's interpreting what that data actually means for their specific situation.\n\nREFRAME: Your clients don't need the fastest agent anymore — they need the one who makes complexity simple. [ON-SCREEN: COMPLEXITY → SIMPLE] You can start this shift on your next listing appointment.\n\nCTA: \"Before you answer 'what should we price at,' try this exact line: 'Let me show you what that number tells buyers about how we're positioning you.' Are you going to try this approach?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The market shifted. Speed isn't winning anymore — judgment is. Here's how top agents are adapting.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateAgent #ListingAgent #RealEstateTips #AgentMindset #RealEstateStrategy\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Your clients don't need the fastest agent anymore — they need the one who makes complexity simple.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Pause after \"slowest\" in the hook for maximum impact\n2. Emphasize \"judgment over urgency\" as the key contrast\n3. Slow down and make direct eye contact during the reframe line about complexity",
