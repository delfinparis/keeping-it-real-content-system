  "polished_script": "HOOK: A $50 million producer just said something that stopped me cold. [ON-SCREEN: $50M PRODUCER]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know that feeling when your phone rings at 9 PM and you hesitate before answering? When client calls start feeling like interruptions instead of opportunities? [ON-SCREEN: 9 PM PHONE CALL] When you've been grinding so long that every lead feels like just another transaction to close? You're not alone — most agents hit this wall around year three. [ON-SCREEN: YEAR 3 BURNOUT]\n\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what separates the agents who burn out from the ones who build empires.\n\nINSIGHT: Kristee Leonard — 18 years in luxury real estate, still answers every call like it's her first day. [ON-SCREEN: 18 YEARS EXPERIENCE] Here's exactly what she told me: \"I don't take that for granted... for someone to choose you, it is an honor.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"IT IS AN HONOR\"] Not a transaction. Not a commission check. An honor. And here's how it shows up: When Zillow transfers a lead to her, she doesn't introduce herself first — she asks when they want to see the house. [ON-SCREEN: SKIP THE INTRO] Because they already chose her. Most agents forget this — they start seeing clients as interruptions. [ON-SCREEN: INTERRUPTION VS HONOR] Top producers like Kristee see them as the reason they still get to do this work.\n\nREFRAME: Every person who calls you passed on dozens of other agents. They didn't choose your brokerage — they chose you. That's not pressure, that's privilege. You can shift this mindset today.\n\nCTA: \"When's the last time you answered the phone like it was an honor — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The mindset shift that separates $50M producers from everyone else 👆 (It's not what you think)\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorTips #LuxuryRealEstate #RealEstateAgent #ClientService\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Every person who calls you passed on dozens of other agents — that's not pressure, that's privilege.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Pause dramatically after \"stopped me cold\" in the hook — let the curiosity build\n2. Emphasize \"HONOR\" both times with genuine reverence, not just volume\n3. Maintain direct eye contact during the reframe section — this is the transformation moment",
