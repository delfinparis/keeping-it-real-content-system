One unified system, still locally run, but every agent has access to every data point, everywhere. Here's what that means for you tomorrow: A buyer calls asking about Austin. Right now, you scramble for referrals. With a national system? You pull last 90 days of closes, filter by their price point, and text them three neighborhoods with rising inventory—before lunch.
