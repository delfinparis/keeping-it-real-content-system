  "polished_script": "**HOOK:** You're lying to yourself about one thing. And it's costing you $300,000 a year. [ON-SCREEN: LYING TO YOURSELF = $300K LOSS]\n\n**BRAND INTRO:** \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\n**SETUP:** Paul Salter coaches seven-figure agents, and he says the number one thing holding you back isn't your market, your leads, or your systems. [ON-SCREEN: PAUL SALTER - 7-FIGURE AGENT COACH] It's the story you keep telling yourself about what you signed up for. You're working 60 hours a week while telling everyone — including yourself — that you want \"balance.\" You're building a business while pretending you don't want to dominate. [ON-SCREEN: 60 HOURS/WEEK + \"I WANT BALANCE\" = MISERY]\n\n**[15-SEC RE-HOOK]:** But here's what Paul discovered with his highest-earning clients.\n\n**INSIGHT:** Every single breakthrough begins with honest communication — starting with yourself. [ON-SCREEN: BREAKTHROUGH = HONEST COMMUNICATION] Last month, Paul had a client — 15 years in, $8 million in production — tell him she wanted \"balance.\" He said, \"What do you actually want?\" Turns out she wanted to build a $20 million team and retire her husband. [ON-SCREEN: $8M PRODUCER → $20M TEAM GOAL] But she'd been pretending she wanted a lifestyle business because that's what her friends respected. She was doing the work of a $20 million producer while telling herself she wanted less. The work didn't match the story. [ON-SCREEN: WORK ≠ STORY = MISERABLE]\n\n**REFRAME:** The resentment you feel isn't burnout — it's incongruency. You either want to dominate your market or you don't. Both are fine. But pick one and stop lying about it. The moment you get honest about what you're actually building and what it takes, the resentment stops.\n\n**CTA:** \"What story have you been telling yourself that doesn't match the work you're actually doing?\"\n\n**CLOSE:** \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\n**CAPTION:** The #1 thing costing agents $300K+ isn't market conditions — it's self-deception about what they actually want to build.\n\n**HASHTAGS:** #RealEstate #AgentMindset #HonestCommunication #RealEstateCoaching #AgentSuccess\n\n**SHAREABLE_MOMENT:** \"The resentment you feel isn't burnout — it's incongruency.\"\n\n**PERFORMANCE_NOTES:** \n1. Emphasize the $300K number with a slight pause after for impact\n2. Slow down on \"work didn't match the story\" — this is the key insight\n3. Direct eye contact during the CTA question to create personal connection",
