  "polished_script": "HOOK: You hit top 1% and you're still losing everything that matters. [ON-SCREEN: Top 1% ≠ Winning]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're crushing your production goals, but missing your kid's games. You're the top agent in your office, but your marriage is hanging by a thread. You're making great money, but you haven't taken a real day off in two years. [ON-SCREEN: Success at What Cost?]\n\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Garrett Maroon figured out at 47 transactions that changed everything.\n\nINSIGHT: Most agents chase a success formula they didn't even write. Garrett Maroon built a top 1% business in Southeast Virginia, then did something radical: he fired 60% of his database. [ON-SCREEN: Fired 60% of Database] Just stopped chasing C and D clients. Hired a $15-an-hour showing assistant. Built iron boundaries: no calls after 6pm, no Sunday showings. [ON-SCREEN: No Calls After 6pm] His volume dropped from 47 deals to 32 the next year. But he coached every single one of his son's baseball games and made more per transaction working with A-clients who actually valued his time. [ON-SCREEN: 32 Deals = More Profit]\n\nREFRAME: You can be the top producer in your market and still be failing at the life you actually want. The breakthrough isn't doing more deals — it's getting clear on what you're building toward and having the guts to cut what doesn't fit.\n\nCTA: \"Open your client list right now — how many people on there drain your energy and give nothing back?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Top 1% agent fired 60% of his database and made MORE money working fewer hours. Here's exactly what he did 👇\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #WorkLifeBalance #TopProducer #RealEstateSuccess #AgentTips\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You can be the top producer in your market and still be failing at the life you actually want.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver hook with genuine concern, not celebration — pause after \"top 1%\" \n2. Speed up during the statistics (47 to 32 deals) but slow down on \"coached every single game\"\n3. Look directly into camera during the reframe — this is the money quote",
