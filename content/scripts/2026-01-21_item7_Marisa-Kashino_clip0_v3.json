  "polished_script": "HOOK: The rage is what keeps you going. And it's killing you. [ON-SCREEN: THE RAGE IS KILLING YOU]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Best-selling author Marisa Kashino wrote a character who cracks under pressure trying to look perfect. You know this feeling — posting that listing at 11 PM, deleting and re-uploading your team photo five times, watching other agents who seem to never sleep or struggle. [ON-SCREEN: PERFORMING PERFECTION 24/7]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what she told me that changed everything about burnout.\n\nINSIGHT: Kashino said her character has \"this constantly simmering rage that propels her to do horrible things.\" Not dramatic meltdowns — the slow burn of chasing impossible standards. [ON-SCREEN: \"CONSTANTLY SIMMERING RAGE\"] Social media didn't create this pressure, it just made it visible 24/7. Now your clients see other agents who look flawless, so you perform harder. Post more. Smile wider. [ON-SCREEN: THE BAR KEEPS MOVING] But here's the truth: that rage isn't anger at clients. It's your body rejecting the performance of perfection.\n\nREFRAME: What if the rage is actually data? It's telling you that performing perfection isn't sustainable. You've already built a successful career — you don't need to prove you can do everything flawlessly anymore.\n\nCTA: \"What's one 'imperfect' thing about your business you've been hiding that you could share this week?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The \"constantly simmering rage\" of trying to be the perfect agent is actually your body rejecting an impossible standard. What if you stopped performing?\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #AgentBurnout #Authenticity #RealEstateAgent #KeepingItReal\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"That rage isn't anger at clients — it's your body rejecting the performance of perfection.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: 1) Deliver hook with slower, more serious pacing to match emotional weight 2) Emphasize \"constantly simmering rage\" with slight pause before and after 3) Lean into camera during reframe section for more intimate connection",
