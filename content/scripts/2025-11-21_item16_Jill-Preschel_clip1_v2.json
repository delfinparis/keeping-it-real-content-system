Because urgency without clarity is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Budget without alignment is a deal that falls apart at the attorney review. She's not gatekeeping. She's protecting her reputation. And that restraint? That's what gets her the next referral from a developer who knows she won't waste their time with tire-kickers in Hermès.",
