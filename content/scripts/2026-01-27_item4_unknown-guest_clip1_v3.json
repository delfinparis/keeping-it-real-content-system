  "polished_script": "HOOK: Top 1% agent never converts leads. [ON-SCREEN: NEVER converts leads?]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Sarah Meslowski generates 85% of her Metro Atlanta business from one platform. [ON-SCREEN: 85% from ONE platform] When her leads call, they're already sold. No pitch needed. No objection handling. They've decided she's their agent before she picks up the phone. [ON-SCREEN: Already decided = their agent] Most agents are still chasing cold leads, sending DMs, trying to convince strangers they're worth the commission.\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Sarah does that changes everything.\n\nINSIGHT: Instead of interrupting people on social media, she creates YouTube videos answering exactly what buyers are already searching for. [ON-SCREEN: Answer what they're SEARCHING for] \"Best neighborhoods in Atlanta.\" \"What to know before moving to Buckhead.\" \"School district breakdowns.\" When someone watches three of her videos, they don't call to be convinced. As Sarah puts it: \"You're not having to convert them. They're now just simply moving into, okay, here's what we're thinking about.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"You're not having to convert them\"] The call becomes pure logistics. They found her. They trust her. They're ready.\n\nREFRAME: That's the difference between interruption marketing and being the answer to someone's search. You can start this today. Pick the one question buyers in your market Google most. Make that video.\n\nCTA: \"What's the number one question buyers ask you about your market?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Top 1% agent generates 85% of business from YouTube without converting a single lead. Here's her exact strategy.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateLeads #YouTubeMarketing #RealEstateAgent #LeadGeneration #RealEstateTips\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You're not having to convert them. They're now just simply moving into, okay, here's what we're thinking about.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: 1) Deliver hook with genuine surprise/disbelief in voice 2) Slow down slightly on Sarah's quote - let it land 3) Lean forward during reframe to create urgency",
