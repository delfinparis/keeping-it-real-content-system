  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your about me video is boring because you're bragging about the wrong things. [ON-SCREEN: \"Your About Me Video Is BORING\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Most agents fill their videos with awards, years in business, and designations. And prospects scroll right past every single one. You're talking about yourself when you should be talking about them. [ON-SCREEN: \"Awards Don't Close Deals\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Kim Ritberg — former TV producer who's coached hundreds of agents — told me that changes everything.\n\nINSIGHT: She said: \"Accomplishments can also be past clients that you helped save money, make more money, or have a more stress-free experience.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Client Wins > Your Awards\"] Not your rookie of the year plaque. The family you helped buy their first home for thirty thousand under asking. The seller you got an extra week to move out so they didn't need storage. The couple you guided through a bidding war without losing their sanity. [ON-SCREEN: \"Show Specific Client Results\"]\n\nREFRAME: Because nobody hires you because you won an award. They hire you because they believe you can solve their exact problem. And the fastest way to prove that? Show them you already solved it for someone just like them. [ON-SCREEN: \"Proof Beats Awards Every Time\"]\n\nCTA: \"What's one specific client win you could share in your next video?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop bragging about awards in your about me videos. Share client wins instead. People hire problem-solvers, not award winners.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateMarketing #AgentTips #VideoMarketing #RealEstateSuccess #ClientWins\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Nobody hires you because you won an award — they hire you because they believe you can solve their exact problem.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver HOOK with slight frustration/disappointment in voice to mirror viewer's video struggles\n2. Emphasize \"thirty thousand under asking\" and \"extra week\" with slight pause for impact\n3. Make eye contact more direct during REFRAME when saying \"nobody hires you because...\" — this is the truth-telling moment",
