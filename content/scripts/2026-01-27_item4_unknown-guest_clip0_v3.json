  "polished_script": "HOOK: You're creating content on the wrong platform. [ON-SCREEN: WRONG PLATFORM]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're posting Instagram Reels three times a day. You're dancing on TikTok. You're chasing every algorithm update, burning yourself out on the content hamster wheel — and your phone still isn't ringing. [ON-SCREEN: CHASING ALGORITHMS] You're frustrated because you're putting in the work but not seeing the leads. Meanwhile, Sarah Meslowski — a top 1% agent in Metro Atlanta — gets 85% of her business from one platform. [ON-SCREEN: 85% FROM ONE PLATFORM]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: And it's not the platform you think.\n\nINSIGHT: YouTube. [ON-SCREEN: YOUTUBE] Here's why this matters: YouTube is the second biggest search engine online next to Google. Think about that. [ON-SCREEN: #2 SEARCH ENGINE] When someone types \"best neighborhoods in Atlanta,\" they're not scrolling for entertainment — they're searching with buying intent. [ON-SCREEN: BUYING INTENT] Sarah created 200 videos over three years. [ON-SCREEN: 200 VIDEOS, 3 YEARS] Now her videos show up, her phone rings, and those videos work for her 24/7. While you're stuck posting daily, her old videos are still generating leads.\n\nREFRAME: Here's what changes: you stop performing for an audience and start answering the questions your buyers are already typing. [ON-SCREEN: ANSWER BUYER QUESTIONS] Your content becomes an asset, not a daily obligation. You can start this today.\n\nCTA: \"Open YouTube right now and search 'moving to' plus your city. Who owns that space — and why isn't it you?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop chasing algorithms. Sarah gets 85% of her business from YouTube. Here's why it works better than Instagram or TikTok for real estate.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #YouTubeMarketing #RealEstateAgent #LeadGeneration #RealEstateTips\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You stop performing for an audience and start answering the questions your buyers are already typing.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: 1) Emphasize \"YOUTUBE\" with a slight pause before and after for impact. 2) Slow down on the statistics (85%, #2 search engine) to let them land. 3) Direct eye contact during the CTA — make it feel like a personal challenge.",
