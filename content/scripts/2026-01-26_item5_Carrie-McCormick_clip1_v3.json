  "polished_script": "HOOK: You're marketing to buyers who can't afford your listings. [ON-SCREEN: WRONG BUYERS = $0 COMMISSION]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Carrie McCormick — top 1% producer in Chicago luxury — just dropped a stat that explains why your lead gen isn't converting. [ON-SCREEN: CARRIE McCORMICK - TOP 1% CHICAGO] You're running Instagram ads for millennials, optimizing TikTok for first-time buyers, spending thousands on digital marketing aimed at 30-somethings who are house-hunting online. [ON-SCREEN: YOUR MARKETING → 30-YEAR-OLDS]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what the data actually shows about who's buying homes right now.\n\nINSIGHT: The average home buyer today is 56 to 59 years old. [ON-SCREEN: AVERAGE BUYER AGE: 56-59] And here's the kicker — 30% of them are paying all cash. [ON-SCREEN: 30% PAY ALL CASH] Not financing. Not stretching for down payments. Cash. These are downsizers, empty nesters, investors who've built equity for decades. [ON-SCREEN: DOWNSIZERS + EMPTY NESTERS = CASH BUYERS] They don't scroll TikTok for agent recommendations. They want advisors who understand tax implications, legacy planning, and their actual timeline. [ON-SCREEN: THEY WANT: TAX ADVICE + LEGACY PLANNING] Most agents are completely invisible to this demographic because they're fishing in the wrong pond.\n\nREFRAME: Your 2025 strategy needs to flip. Stop chasing volume with broke millennials. [ON-SCREEN: STOP CHASING VOLUME] Start building relationships with the generation that actually closes. Your messaging, your marketing, your entire client experience — it needs to speak to people who value expertise over Instagram followers.\n\nCTA: \"When's the last time you had a real conversation with a 58-year-old about their next move?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The average home buyer is 56-59 years old and 30% pay all cash. Are you marketing to the right generation?\n\nHASHTAGS: #realestate #realtor #luxuryrealestate #realestatemarketing #keepingitreal\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Stop chasing volume with broke millennials — start building relationships with the generation that actually closes.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Emphasize \"56 to 59 years old\" and \"30% all cash\" with dramatic pause for impact\n2. Speed up delivery during setup to build tension, slow down on the key stats in insight\n3. Direct eye contact and lean forward slightly on the CTA question to create intimacy",
