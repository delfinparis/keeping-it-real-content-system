  "polished_script": "HOOK: A bestselling author just wrote a psychological thriller about buying a house. [ON-SCREEN: \"Psychological Thriller About... House Hunting?\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Not about murder or money laundering — about the actual process of trying to buy a home in today's market. [ON-SCREEN: \"The Process IS The Thriller\"] You know that client energy when they've been outbid three times, trapped in a rental, searching for months while prices climb? That desperation that makes them suggest crazy escalation clauses or write ten-page love letters to sellers?\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what this author discovered that changes everything.\n\nINSIGHT: Marisa Kashino's protagonist gets outbid eleven times over two years of searching. [ON-SCREEN: \"Outbid 11 Times in 2 Years\"] The character literally unravels — becomes obsessive, unhinged, willing to do anything. And Marisa says this: \"The stakes feel so high when you're in it. I thought it would make the perfect context for a thriller.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"The stakes feel so high...\"] Here's the wild part: agents told her they've seen this exact energy in real buyers. The biggest investment most people ever make, and you're guiding them through what feels like psychological warfare.\n\nREFRAME: So when your buyer melts down over losing another house, you're not dealing with crazy — you're dealing with stakes so intense they literally inspired a dark thriller. [ON-SCREEN: \"You're Not Dealing With Crazy\"] The book is called \"Best Offer Wins.\" Read it, then hand it to your most anxious buyer and say \"I promise we won't let it get this far.\"\n\nCTA: \"Have you had a buyer completely unravel during the search process?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: When house hunting becomes psychological warfare 📚 Your buyers aren't crazy — the stakes really are that high. #RealEstate\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #BuyerAgent #HomeSearch #ClientPsychology #RealEstateAgent\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You're not dealing with crazy — you're dealing with stakes so intense they literally inspired a dark thriller.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Deliver hook with genuine surprise/intrigue, slight pause before \"house.\" [2] Slow down on the Marisa quote for impact — this is the money moment. [3] Lean forward during reframe for intimacy, like sharing a secret insight.",
