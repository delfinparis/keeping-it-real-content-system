Chase ignores interest rates, inventory numbers, what Zillow's doing, what his competitors post. He built an empire on three things: his database — he texts every past client on their birthday, no exceptions. His response time — leads get called back in under five minutes, period. And his daily actions — five prospecting calls before he checks email. That's it. Everything else is noise.",
