  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your next lowball offer is about to kill the deal. [ON-SCREEN: \"LOWBALL = DEAD DEAL\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: We've all been there — you think you're being strategic with your offer, seller gets insulted, deal dies. Tim Burrell, top producer in Raleigh with over 200 transactions annually, used to lose deals this way constantly. [ON-SCREEN: \"Tim Burrell - 200+ transactions/year\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But now he never sends an offer blind — and here's his secret weapon.\n\nINSIGHT: Tim runs every single offer through AI first. Before hitting send, he feeds the situation to ChatGPT — seller's motivation, client's position, the actual offer amount. Then asks for the three most probable responses. [ON-SCREEN: \"1. Feed AI the situation 2. Ask for 3 probable responses\"] Tim says, \"AI will give you some feedback in terms of should you do this or should you not do this.\" It's like having a negotiation simulator. He tests the offer privately, sees where sellers might explode, adjusts the strategy, then goes live. [ON-SCREEN: \"TEST → ADJUST → SEND\"]\n\nREFRAME: Most agents negotiate in real time and learn from rejection. Top producers war-game every scenario before the seller ever sees it. You can literally do this on your next offer — takes two minutes, could save your deal.\n\nCTA: \"Are you testing your offers with AI before sending, or are you still winging it?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Top producer uses AI to test every offer before sending. Game-changer for negotiations. 🤖🏠 #RealEstate\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #Negotiation #AI #RealEstateAgent #PropertyDeals\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Top producers war-game every scenario before the seller ever sees it.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: 1) Emphasize \"kill the deal\" in hook with slight pause after. 2) Speed up during the 3-step process, slow down for Tim's quote. 3) Direct eye contact on final CTA question.",
