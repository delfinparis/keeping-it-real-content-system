You move on. Most agents never prospect because they treat a 'no' like a referendum on their worth. Eithan treats it like a data point. He teaches his agents to add value, not spam — neighborhood updates, market intel, hyper-local insights. But the secret? He makes them understand that rejection isn't the barrier.
