  "polished_script": "HOOK: Most agents lose deals in the first thirty seconds. [ON-SCREEN: Lost before you start]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You walk into that listing appointment with your presentation dialed in. Comps printed. Market analysis ready. You're about to crush this. But the homeowner's arms are crossed, they're checking their phone, and you can feel the resistance before you even sit down. [ON-SCREEN: Sound familiar?]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: Here's what Tim Burrell — attorney, contractor, and 45-year top producer — says you're doing completely backwards.\n\nINSIGHT: Tim's rule after four decades in this business? [ON-SCREEN: 45 years experience] \"Find out something you've got in common. Establish some sort of rapport, get some kind of relationship going and then work on solving the problem.\" Not rapport as manipulation — rapport as foundation. [ON-SCREEN: Foundation first] Because here's what 45 years teaches you: people don't negotiate with strangers. They negotiate with people they trust. Even a little. Even for five minutes. [ON-SCREEN: Trust > tactics]\n\nREFRAME: That presentation you spent hours perfecting? You're starting at step three. You tried to solve a problem for someone who didn't see you as human yet. You can fix this in your very next appointment.\n\nCTA: \"What's one thing you always ask to find common ground — drop it below.\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: 45-year top producer reveals why most agents lose deals in the first 30 seconds (it's not what you think)\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorTips #Negotiation #RealEstateAgent #KeepingItReal\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"People don't negotiate with strangers. They negotiate with people they trust.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver hook with genuine concern, not hype — this is about their pain\n2. Slow down on Tim's quote in INSIGHT — let it land with weight and authority  \n3. Lean forward slightly during REFRAME — shift to helpful mentor energy",
