  "polished_script": "HOOK: You've already been hypnotized three times today without knowing it. [ON-SCREEN: \"You've Been Hypnotized 3x Today\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You dismiss hypnosis as some weird party trick with pocket watches and mind control. Meanwhile, you're carrying limiting beliefs about money, success, and what you deserve that you never consciously chose — and they're killing your production. [ON-SCREEN: \"Limiting Beliefs You Never Chose\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what performance coach Paul Salter told me that changes everything.\n\nINSIGHT: Quote: \"Hypnosis is not magic. It's not mind control. It's a natural state of mind you've already been in today multiple times.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Natural State of Mind\"] That zone-out in the shower this morning? Hypnosis. That flow state during your workout? Hypnosis. [ON-SCREEN: \"Shower Zone-Out = Hypnosis\"] It's just the brainwave state between awake and asleep — where your subconscious is open to rewiring old beliefs. [ON-SCREEN: \"Subconscious Rewiring Zone\"] The same beliefs that whisper \"you're not worth that commission\" or \"successful agents are just lucky.\"\n\nREFRAME: Which means the tool you've been dismissing as pseudoscience is the exact same state your brain uses naturally to change itself. You're already doing it — you're just not doing it on purpose. You can start today.\n\nCTA: \"What limiting belief are you carrying that you never consciously chose?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The \"pseudoscience\" you've been dismissing is actually rewiring your brain 3x daily 🧠 What beliefs are you carrying that you never chose?\nHASHTAGS: #realestate #mindset #hypnosis #success #beliefs\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You're already doing it — you're just not doing it on purpose.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Deliver hook with slight pause after \"three times\" for emphasis [2] Speed up during the shower/workout examples for energy [3] Slow down and lean in during the reframe for impact",
