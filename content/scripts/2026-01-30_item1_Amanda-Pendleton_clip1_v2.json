But they're researching on TikTok at 11pm, watching neighborhood tours on YouTube during lunch, and asking ChatGPT about mortgage rates — not calling you. They don't need another market report email. They need an agent who answers DMs in under an hour, posts 30-second neighborhood walkthroughs showing the coffee shop three blocks away, and explains down payment assistance like they're texting a friend. The average first-time buyer age is now 36. Every year they wait costs them $30,000 in equity.",
