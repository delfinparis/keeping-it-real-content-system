Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Carrie McCormick has closed over 300 million in real estate, and she says most agents are completely invisible online — and they don't even realize it. [ON-SCREEN: $300M+ IN SALES] You could be the most knowledgeable agent in your market, but when buyers Google \"realtor near me,\" you're nowhere to be found while your competition is booking appointments. [ON-SCREEN: \"REALTOR NEAR ME\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's the part that'll shock you about where you actually rank.\n\nINSIGHT: Carrie says, \"Double down on your personal brand and SEO. Audit your online presence to see how you rank.\" [ON-SCREEN: AUDIT YOUR ONLINE PRESENCE] Here's her system: Google your name plus \"realtor\" plus your city right now. Are you on page one? Because 97% of buyers start there. [ON-SCREEN: 97% START ON GOOGLE] And here's what's killing you — that headshot from 2015, three-star Google reviews you never responded to, and a website that takes eight seconds to load on mobile. [ON-SCREEN: OUTDATED HEADSHOT = LOST DEALS]\n\nREFRAME: You're not losing to better agents — you're losing to agents who fixed those three things. This isn't about being tech-savvy. It's about being findable when it matters most.\n\nCTA: \"Are you on page one when someone Googles your name plus realtor — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Most agents are invisible online and don't know it. Here's how to fix it 👇 #RealEstate\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorTips #SEO #PersonalBrand #RealEstateMarketing\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You're not losing to better agents — you're losing to agents who fixed those three things.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1) Emphasize \"aren't even better\" in hook with slight pause, 2) Speed up during the Google search instruction for urgency, 3) Direct eye contact on final CTA question]",
