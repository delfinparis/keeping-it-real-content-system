  "polished_script": "HOOK: Ten months of postcards. Zero calls. Almost bankrupt. [ON-SCREEN: 10 MONTHS • 0 CALLS]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Jay Cannone is a top 1% producer now, but back then he was broke. Sitting on agent calls listening to everyone else celebrate deals while he had nothing. [ON-SCREEN: TOP 1% NOW • BROKE THEN] He was ready to quit his entire marketing strategy after ten months of sending postcards with zero response.\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But month eleven changed everything—and the reason why will shock you.\n\nINSIGHT: Month eleven, a luxury seller finally calls. Jay asks, \"Why me?\" The seller says: \"Anybody who sends me these postcards as consistently as you've done for the past ten months—that's who I want to work with.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"CONSISTENCY = TRUST\"] It wasn't the prettiest design or cleverest copy. The seller had been watching, testing, waiting to see if Jay would quit like everyone else. [ON-SCREEN: THEY'RE ALWAYS WATCHING]\n\nREFRAME: You think nobody's noticing your marketing, but they are. They're just not ready yet. Every postcard, email, and video is a deposit in your credibility account. The clients worth having? They're counting to see who sticks around. [ON-SCREEN: EVERY TOUCHPOINT = DEPOSIT]\n\nCTA: \"What marketing strategy did you quit on at month nine?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: He almost quit at month 10. Month 11 changed his entire career. The lesson? They're always watching—even when they're not responding.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateMarketing #Consistency #AgentTips #MarketingStrategy #RealEstateSuccess\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Every postcard, email, and video is a deposit in your credibility account—and the clients worth having are counting.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. HOOK: Deliver with urgency, slight pause between each phrase for impact\n2. INSIGHT: Slow down on the quote—make it feel conversational, like you're sharing a secret\n3. REFRAME: Build intensity through \"They're counting\"—this is the mic drop moment",
