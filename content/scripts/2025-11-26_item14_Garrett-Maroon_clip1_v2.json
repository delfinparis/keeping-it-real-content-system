Garrett hit his breaking point at 47 transactions. His daughter asked why he missed her recital. Again. So he did something radical: he fired 60% of his database. Just stopped chasing C and D clients. Hired a showing assistant for $15 an hour. And built a boundary: no calls after 6pm, no showings on Sundays. His volume dropped to 32 deals the next year. But you know what? He coached every single one of his son's baseball games. And he made more per transaction because he was working with A clients who actually valued his time.",
