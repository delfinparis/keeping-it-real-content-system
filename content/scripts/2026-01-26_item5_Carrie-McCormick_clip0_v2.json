Last month, Carrie had a buyer ready to offer full price on a Lincoln Park condo. Inspection came back clean. Buyer's lender pre-approved. But Carrie walked them. Why? The building had two special assessments pending — $40K total — buried in the board minutes. The fast agent closes that deal and deals with the fallout. The strategic agent reads the minutes, does the math, and says 'we walk.' That's judgment. That's what clients pay six percent for in 2026.",
