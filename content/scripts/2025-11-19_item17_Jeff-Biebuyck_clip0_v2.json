Here's what he means: A mentor told him for years to follow up within 24 hours. He nodded. He agreed. Then he waited three days to call back a lead. Someone else swooped in. $2.1 million gone. That's when the advice became real. Not when he heard it. When it cost him. You've been told to nurture your database, right?
