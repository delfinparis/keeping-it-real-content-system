They repainted the front door. Introduced themselves to four neighbors. Started complaining about the potholes on their street — because now it was *their* street. Courtney's take: 'If you're renting, that's 100% loss. But owning? It improves culture, society, the whole block.' She's not talking about equity. She's talking about the day someone stops being a tenant and starts being a neighbor. When you help someone buy, you're not just closing a deal — you're anchoring a family.",
