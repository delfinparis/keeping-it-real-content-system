  "polished_script": "HOOK: One of my buyers stopped paying rent three months ago. [ON-SCREEN: STOPPED PAYING RENT]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know that buyer who keeps saying \"I'm just not ready yet\"? The one who's been renting for six years, moving every eighteen months, never really settling anywhere? [ON-SCREEN: 6 YEARS RENTING] Courtney Poulos, who runs a renovation brokerage in LA, just told me exactly what happens in the first ninety days after someone finally stops renting and starts owning. [ON-SCREEN: 90 DAYS]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: And it has nothing to do with building equity.\n\nINSIGHT: Here's what happened with her Echo Park buyers: Young couple, six years of renting, never knew their neighbors' names. [ON-SCREEN: NEVER KNEW NEIGHBORS] Three months after closing? They repainted their front door, introduced themselves to four neighbors, and started complaining about potholes — because now it was their street. [ON-SCREEN: THEIR STREET] Courtney's exact words: \"If you're renting, that's one hundred percent loss. But owning? It improves culture, society, the whole block.\" [ON-SCREEN: 100% LOSS VS BUILDING COMMUNITY] She's talking about the day someone stops being a tenant and starts being a neighbor.\n\nREFRAME: When your buyer says they're \"not ready,\" they're not wrong about market timing. They're missing what actually changes when you own — you suddenly care about the park two blocks away. That's the conversation that moves people.\n\nCTA: \"Pull up one past client who bought this year — what's one thing they've done to their place that they never would've done as a renter?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The real reason homeownership changes everything (and it's not about equity) 🏠\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #Homeownership #RealEstateAgent #BuyerAgent #PropertyInvestment\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"If you're renting, that's one hundred percent loss. But owning? It improves culture, society, the whole block.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Pause after \"stopped paying rent\" for maximum impact [2] Speed up during Courtney's quote to build energy [3] Direct eye contact on \"that's the conversation that moves people\"]",
