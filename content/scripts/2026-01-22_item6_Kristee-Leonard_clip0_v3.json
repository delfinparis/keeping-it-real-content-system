  "polished_script": "HOOK: The agent who closed four deals last month isn't smarter than you. [ON-SCREEN: \"NOT SMARTER THAN YOU\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: They just made forty-seven calls while you were perfecting your Instagram bio. You're researching CRMs, optimizing your website, waiting to feel \"ready.\" Meanwhile, agents with half your knowledge are booking appointments every single day. [ON-SCREEN: \"HALF YOUR KNOWLEDGE, DOUBLE YOUR RESULTS\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what fifty-million-dollar producer Kristee Leonard told me that changes everything.\n\nINSIGHT: \"You don't have to be the smartest person in the room. You just have to outwork the smartest person in the room.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"OUTWORK > OUTSMART\"] While they're planning content calendars, she's texting twenty past clients: \"Who do you know moving this spring?\" While they're at networking mixers, she's hand-writing notes to her last ten closings. [ON-SCREEN: \"20 TEXTS > 20 STRATEGIES\"] Kristee doesn't win on strategy. She wins on reps.\n\nREFRAME: You've been waiting to know enough, to have perfect scripts, to feel ready. But every hour you wait, someone with worse marketing and better hustle is closing your deal. The learning phase is over.\n\nCTA: \"Right now, text five past clients this exact message: 'Quick question: who do you know thinking about moving?' Are you going to send it or keep waiting?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop perfecting. Start prospecting. This $50M producer's mindset will change how you think about success. 📞\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #Prospecting #Sales #Mindset #Success\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You don't have to be the smartest person in the room. You just have to outwork the smartest person in the room.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Deliver hook with confident energy, slight pause after \"smarter than you\" [2] Speed up during brand intro, slow down for Kristee's quote [3] Lean forward during CTA, direct eye contact on \"Are you going to send it\"]",

Transformed vague 'make ten calls tomorrow' CTA into hyper-specific 'text five past clients THIS EXACT MESSAGE right now before video ends' with 45-second urgency. Added three ultra-specific action examples (text 20 past clients with exact wording, record 3 iPhone tours, send 10 handwritten notes) to replace abstract comparisons.",
