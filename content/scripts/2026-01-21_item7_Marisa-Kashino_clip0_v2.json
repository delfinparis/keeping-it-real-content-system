Just the slow burn of trying to be the perfect agent, perfect parent, perfect body, perfect feed. You're performing success while the bar keeps moving. Social media didn't create this pressure — it just made it visible 24/7. Now your clients see other agents who look like they never sleep, never struggle, never have a bad listing photo. So you perform harder. Post more. Smile wider. The rage isn't anger at clients. It's anger at the impossible standard you're racing toward.",
