Last month, I had a client — 15 years in, $8 million in production — tell me she wanted 'balance.' I said, 'Bullshit. What do you actually want?' Turns out she wanted to build a $20 million team and retire her husband. But she'd been pretending she wanted a lifestyle business because that's what her friends respected. So she was doing the work of a $20 million producer while telling herself she wanted less. That's why she was miserable. The work didn't match the story. Here's the truth: You either want to dominate your market or you don't. Both are fine. But pick one and stop lying about it.",

The moment you get honest — 'This is what I'm building, this is what it takes, here's how long' — the resentment stops. Not because the work changes. Because the lie ends.",
      "production_note": "Split screen: left shows agent fake-smiling at dinner table, checking phone under table. Right shows same agent having direct eye-contact conversation with spouse, calendar open between them. Visual: weight literally lifting off shoulders as honesty happens."
