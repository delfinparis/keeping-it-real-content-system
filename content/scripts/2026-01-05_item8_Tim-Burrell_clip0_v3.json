  "polished_script": "HOOK: Top producers already know your kids' soccer team before they knock on your door. [ON-SCREEN: \"They know before they arrive\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You've been there — sitting across from potential sellers, scrambling for something to connect on while they size you up as a stranger. Meanwhile, the agent who listed their neighbor's house last month felt like family from minute one. [ON-SCREEN: \"Struggling to connect?\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: Here's how Tim Burrell — Raleigh's top producer — closes that gap in sixty seconds.\n\nINSIGHT: Before every listing appointment, Tim feeds one simple prompt to ChatGPT: the prospect's name plus their social profiles. [ON-SCREEN: \"60 seconds with AI\"] The AI scans their background, education, business experience, then compares their social media to his. It finds the commonalities — your kids both play travel soccer, you went to similar schools, you root for the same teams. [ON-SCREEN: \"Finds common ground instantly\"] Tim says, \"AI can give you information about the other person, helping you establish rapport and find common ground.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Walk in already connected\"] He walks into that appointment already knowing three things they have in common.\n\nREFRAME: Most agents walk in cold and hope chemistry happens. Top producers manufacture connection before they arrive. [ON-SCREEN: \"Manufacture connection\"] You can do this for your next appointment today.\n\nCTA: \"Will you try this prompt before your next listing appointment — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: This 60-second AI hack helps top producers connect instantly with listing prospects. Tim Burrell shares his exact process.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #ListingAgent #AI #RealtorTips #SalesStrategy\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Most agents walk in cold and hope chemistry happens. Top producers manufacture connection before they arrive.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Emphasize \"sixty seconds\" with a pause after — let that sink in\n2. Slow down on the Tim Burrell quote for maximum impact and quotability  \n3. Direct eye contact on the final CTA question — make it conversational, not scripted",
