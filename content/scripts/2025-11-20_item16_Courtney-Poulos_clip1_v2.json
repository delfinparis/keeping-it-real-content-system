You're not closing deals because your pitch is weak. You're losing deals because trust isn't there. And trust isn't built in a presentation — it's built in how you show up before the pitch ever happens. The mechanic you never question. The doctor whose advice you follow without hesitation. The hairstylist you've been seeing for ten years. They're not better salespeople. They're more trusted people.",
