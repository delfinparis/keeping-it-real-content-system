  "polished_script": "HOOK: The best agents I know are quitting — and it's not what you think. [ON-SCREEN: \"Top agents are QUITTING\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're drowning in CRMs, commission splits, and interest rate panic. Every day feels like chasing deals just to survive. You forgot why you became an agent in the first place, and now you're wondering if it's time to walk away. [ON-SCREEN: \"Sound familiar?\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But Connie Mahan — REALTOR of the Year in Central Florida — just reminded me what we've all forgotten.\n\nINSIGHT: Here's what she told me: \"We are so lucky to get to do what we do — help people honestly and ethically make the largest decision of their life.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Help people make their BIGGEST decision\"] Not close deals. Not hit quota. Help people. You're not a salesperson — you're the person someone trusts with their kids' schools, their parents' retirement, their entire financial future. [ON-SCREEN: \"That's a PRIVILEGE\"] Most agents chase listings. Top producers protect lives.\n\nREFRAME: If you're burned out, maybe it's not because you're doing too much. Maybe you forgot what you're actually doing. Your next client conversation is where you prove you remember.\n\nCTA: \"On your very next buyer or seller call, say this: 'My job is to protect you from making a mistake you can't undo.' Will you try it — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The real reason top agents are quitting (and how to remember why you started) 🏠✨\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorLife #RealEstateAgent #PropertyProfessional #RealEstateTips\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You're not a salesperson — you're the person someone trusts with their entire financial future.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver HOOK with genuine concern, not clickbait energy — this needs to feel real\n2. Slow down on Connie's quote — let it land with weight and reverence \n3. Strong eye contact on the CTA question — make it feel like a personal challenge",
