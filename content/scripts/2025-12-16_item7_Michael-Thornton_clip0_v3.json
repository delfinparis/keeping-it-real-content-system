  "polished_script": "HOOK: The deal that makes you feel invincible is about to destroy your next three months. [ON-SCREEN: Your biggest win = your biggest threat]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know that feeling when you close a massive deal? You're on top of the world, so you ease off prospecting for two weeks. Or you lose a listing and spiral so hard you stop making calls because you're \"not in the right headspace.\" [ON-SCREEN: Sound familiar?] Michael Thornton does thirty million a year in volume, and he says the biggest threat to your business isn't the market.\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: It's your own emotional swings killing your pipeline.\n\nINSIGHT: Here's what Michael means. Top producers treat wins and losses exactly the same way — as data points, not identity markers. [ON-SCREEN: Wins + losses = just data] Quote: \"You can't get too high or too low in this business.\" Monday morning looks identical whether they closed three deals Friday or lost a buyer to another agent. [ON-SCREEN: Same energy every Monday] They've learned what most agents haven't yet — consistency beats intensity every single time.\n\nREFRAME: Because here's the truth: your income isn't determined by your best month or your worst month. It's determined by whether you can do the same six activities every day regardless of how you feel. That's the whole game.\n\nCTA: \"What's the one activity you skip when things are going really well?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The $30M producer's secret to staying consistent through wins and losses 📈📉\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateAgent #Consistency #Mindset #RealEstateTips #TopProducer\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Top producers treat wins and losses exactly the same way — as data points, not identity markers.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: 1) Emphasize \"destroy\" in hook with slight pause after. 2) Slow down and lean in during the quote delivery. 3) Direct eye contact during final CTA question.",
