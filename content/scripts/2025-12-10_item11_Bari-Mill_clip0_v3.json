Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know that sinking feeling — when someone you've stayed in touch with for months suddenly announces they bought a house. With your competitor. [ON-SCREEN: \"They bought with your competitor\"] Bari Mill has done forty million in Chicago real estate, and she remembers that exact knot in her stomach. The one where you replay every conversation, wondering what you did wrong.\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what separates successful agents from the ones who spiral.\n\nINSIGHT: Bari's advice: \"Focus on what you do have, not on what you don't.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Focus on what you DO have\"] You'll obsess over the one person who said no instead of the ten who haven't been asked yet. That friend who's always said they'd refer you? Call them today. [ON-SCREEN: \"Call them TODAY\"] That neighbor who mentioned downsizing six months ago? Text them right now. The business you're chasing is making you miss the business sitting right in front of you.\n\nREFRAME: Every top producer has lost deals to their own cousin. The difference? They didn't let it paralyze them.
