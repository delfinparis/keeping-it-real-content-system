  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your tenth video will destroy someone else's polished first one. [ON-SCREEN: Video #10 > Polished Video #1]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You tried video twice, maybe three times. Felt awkward, got crickets, quit. You're telling yourself you're \"just not a video person.\" Kim Rittberg — former Netflix marketer who produced TV for a decade — now trains agents exactly like you. [ON-SCREEN: Kim Rittberg - Netflix Marketer]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what she discovered about why agents really quit at video three.\n\nINSIGHT: Kim showed me one agent's progression. Video one: \"Um, so... homes are selling fast.\" Stiff. Generic. Video five: still awkward, but she mentioned the new traffic pattern on Maple killing showings. [ON-SCREEN: Video 1 vs Video 5] Video twelve: she's walking buyers through why that traffic creates opportunity three blocks over. Same person. Twelve reps. Kim calls it MSR — Mindset, Skill set, Repetition. [ON-SCREEN: MSR Formula] Here's what really changed: Video one, she's thinking \"I should do this.\" Video twelve: \"I'm the only agent who'll explain this.\" That shift from obligation to authority — that's the mindset unlock.\n\nREFRAME: You're not wrong about your current video skills. You're wrong about your starting point. Stop starting with \"I should make videos.\" Start with \"Only I know this about my market.\" The reps and skills follow automatically.\n\nCTA: \"What's one thing only you know about your market this week — drop it below?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop starting with \"I should.\" Start with \"Only I know this.\" The video skills follow automatically. 🎥\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateVideo #AgentTips #VideoMarketing #RealEstateSuccess #PropertyExpert\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Video one: 'I should do this.' Video twelve: 'I'm the only agent who'll explain this.'\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [Emphasize \"tenth\" and \"polished first\" in hook with hand gestures. Slow down on the MSR breakdown. Direct eye contact during \"only I know this\" moment.]",
