So every time you try something that feels risky — calling a cold lead, saying no to a 9pm showing, raising your commission — your brain reads it as danger. And it pulls you back to what's familiar. What's safe. What's predictable. Paul puts it like this: 'You are programmed to survive. You are not programmed to thrive.' That's why you keep avoiding the same calls. It's not you. It's your wiring.",
