Let 'busy' become their identity. Garrett rebuilt his entire business around one principle: intentional design. He mapped his ideal week FIRST — family dinners, gym time, date nights — then built his client systems around that. Not the other way around. The result? Fewer transactions. Higher income. Actual life outside real estate.",
