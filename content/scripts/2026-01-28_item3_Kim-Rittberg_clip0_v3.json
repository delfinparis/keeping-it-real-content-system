  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your content is invisible because you're copying Google. [ON-SCREEN: Your content is invisible]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're posting market stats, interest rate updates, home buying tips. Zero comments. Zero calls. Because your audience didn't need YOU for information they could Google in ten seconds. [ON-SCREEN: Market stats + interest rates + tips = crickets]\n  [15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what the agents getting calls do differently.\n\nINSIGHT: Kim Rittberg works with top producers, and she's blunt about this: \"Everyone has Google. Everyone has access to you. Don't just take the phone to the internet and say it. Really think about what is YOUR opinion, what is YOUR take?\" [ON-SCREEN: Don't just repeat Google] Here's what that looks like: When rates drop, don't just announce it — tell people if NOW is the time to buy or wait. When a house sits ninety days, don't just share it — explain WHY it's sitting and what that means for buyers in that neighborhood. [ON-SCREEN: Give YOUR take, not Google's]\n\nREFRAME: The agents getting calls aren't posting the most. They're posting with a point of view. Because people don't hire information — they hire perspective. [ON-SCREEN: People hire perspective, not information]\n\nCTA: \"Look at your last post right now — could someone have Googled it in ten seconds?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop posting what people can Google. Start sharing YOUR perspective on the data. That's what gets calls. 💡\nHASHTAGS: #realestatetips #realestateagent #realestatemarketing #agentadvice #keepingitreal\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"People don't hire information — they hire perspective.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Pause after \"invisible\" in hook for impact [2] Speed up during Kim's quote, slow down on \"YOUR take\" [3] Direct eye contact on final CTA question",
