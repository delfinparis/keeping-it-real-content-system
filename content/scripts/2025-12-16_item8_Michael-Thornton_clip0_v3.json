Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Look, I get it. You're charming, you're likable, you think your personality is your biggest asset. You take clients out for drinks, you text them memes, you're basically their new BFF. [ON-SCREEN: \"Being the 'fun agent'\"] But Michael Thornton built a $30 million business in Wheaton, Illinois, and what he discovered about client relationships will surprise you. [ON-SCREEN: \"$30M in sales\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: Here's what most agents get completely wrong about client relationships.\n\nINSIGHT: Michael told me: \"When people don't say 'Hey, we're so fun to work with,' but say 'Thank you for your professionalism' — that's when you know you're doing it right.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Thank you for your professionalism\"] Think about it. Your clients aren't hiring you to grab drinks. They're trusting you with their largest financial decision. [ON-SCREEN: \"Largest financial decision\"] They want competence. They want systems. They want someone who answers emails at 9 PM and knows every line of the contract. [ON-SCREEN: \"Competence > Personality\"] Being likable is table stakes. Being professional gets you referrals.\n\nREFRAME: So if your personality isn't converting to closings, you've been optimizing for the wrong thing. You can start shifting this today — respond faster, know your contracts better, follow up relentlessly.\n\nCTA: \"What's the last compliment a client gave you — was it about your personality or your follow-through?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Your clients don't want to be your friend - they want your professionalism. Michael Thornton's $30M secret revealed. 💼✨\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #Professionalism #ClientService #RealEstateAgent #KeepingItReal\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Being likable is table stakes. Being professional gets you referrals.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: 1) Deliver hook with slight pause after \"friend\" for emphasis 2) Speed up during brand intro, then slow down for Michael's quote 3) Direct eye contact on the final CTA question",
