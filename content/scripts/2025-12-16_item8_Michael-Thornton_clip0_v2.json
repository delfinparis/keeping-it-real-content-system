Think about that. Your clients aren't hiring you to grab drinks. They're trusting you with the biggest financial decision of their lives. They want competence. They want systems. They want someone who answers emails at 9 PM and knows the contract inside-out. Being likable? That's table stakes. Being professional? That's what gets you referrals.",
