  "polished_script": "HOOK: Top 1% producer. One habit. Zero complexity. [ON-SCREEN: \"ONE HABIT = TOP 1%\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're perfecting your CRM sequences, optimizing your lead magnets, chasing the latest social media hack. Meanwhile, you're watching deals slip away to agents who seem less qualified than you. Your phone buzzes during your \"deep work\" block, and you let it go to voicemail. Again. [ON-SCREEN: \"SOUND FAMILIAR?\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Karina Chavez discovered building her referral empire in Albuquerque.\n\nINSIGHT: Her advice? \"Always answer your phone. I think a lot of people take that for granted and it's such an easy one.\" That's it. Not when you're free. Not when it's convenient. When it rings. [ON-SCREEN: \"ALWAYS ANSWER YOUR PHONE\"] Because here's what most agents miss — that call isn't interrupting your work. That call IS your work. [ON-SCREEN: \"THE CALL IS YOUR WORK\"] Every unanswered ring is a client choosing someone else. Someone who picked up.\n\nREFRAME: You're not too busy to answer. You're too busy because you don't answer. The agents winning referrals aren't smarter — they're just there. Present. Available. Human. You can start this today.\n\nCTA: \"This week, answer every call — even the unknowns. Are you willing to try it?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Top 1% habit that's embarrassingly simple (but most agents ignore it) 📱\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorTips #TopProducer #PhoneCalls #ClientService\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"That call isn't interrupting your work. That call IS your work.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Deliver hook with slight disbelief in voice - like it's almost too simple [2] Emphasize \"IS your work\" with finger point to camera [3] Slow down on \"Present. Available. Human.\" - let it land",
