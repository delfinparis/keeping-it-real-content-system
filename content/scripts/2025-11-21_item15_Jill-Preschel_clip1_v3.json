  "polished_script": "HOOK: Agents closing $2 billion in luxury deals send one email after every conversation. [ON-SCREEN: $2B+ luxury agents]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You just had a great showing. Client seemed interested, talked next steps, maybe even threw out a number. You're feeling good. Then three days later they're telling you something completely different than what you remember discussing. Sound familiar? [ON-SCREEN: \"I thought you said...\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: Here's what separates the pros from everyone else.\n\nINSIGHT: Jill Preschel spent years in boardrooms with private equity partners and learned this the hard way: if you don't document it, it never happened. [ON-SCREEN: \"If you don't document it, it never happened\"] Her habit after every single conversation — client calls, showings, negotiations — she sends one email. Not long, just three things: what we discussed, what we agreed on, next steps. [ON-SCREEN: 1. Discussed 2. Agreed 3. Next steps] She learned this sitting across from capital partners who'd conveniently forget what they agreed to in meetings. The email isn't rude — it's a receipt. [ON-SCREEN: The email is a receipt]\n\nREFRAME: This eliminates the \"I thought you said\" arguments, keeps you in control of the narrative, and makes you look like the one professional in a sea of amateurs. You can literally do this today — thirty seconds to write, but it's the difference between being remembered and being forgotten.\n\nCTA: \"Are you sending summary emails after your conversations — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The $2B agents send this one email after every conversation. Most don't. Here's why you should start today.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealEstateAgent #RealEstateTips #LuxuryRealEstate #RealEstateSuccess\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"If you don't document it, it never happened.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. HOOK delivery: Sharp emphasis on \"$2 billion\" — let that number land before continuing\n2. INSIGHT pacing: Slow down on \"it's a receipt\" — this is the key reframe moment\n3. Eye contact: Direct camera contact during \"You can literally do this today\" for personal connection",
