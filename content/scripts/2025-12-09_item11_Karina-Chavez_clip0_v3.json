  "polished_script": "HOOK: A 7pm call on Tuesday became a $480,000 listing by Thursday. [ON-SCREEN: 7PM CALL = $480K LISTING]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're wondering why you're stuck at 30 deals this year while other agents seem to effortlessly hit 50 or 60. You're working harder than ever, but the phone isn't ringing like it used to. You've got leads coming in, but somehow they're not converting at the rate you need. [ON-SCREEN: STUCK AT 30 DEALS?]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Karina Chavez discovered that most agents completely ignore.\n\nINSIGHT: Karina's a top 1% producer in Albuquerque who built her entire business on referrals, and her number one rule is stupidly simple: always answer your phone. [ON-SCREEN: ALWAYS ANSWER YOUR PHONE] That Tuesday evening call? A past client's coworker whose agent went completely dark during inspection. She needed someone who'd actually pick up the phone. Most agents saw that random 7pm number and let it ring straight to voicemail. Karina answered on the second ring. [ON-SCREEN: ANSWERED ON 2ND RING] Here's what nobody tells you — people don't want to leave voicemails about six-figure decisions. They want a human voice right now, and they'll move to the next agent in their contacts faster than you think.\n\nREFRAME: You sent four calls to voicemail last week because you were \"busy.\" One of those mystery numbers could've been your easiest fifteen grand of the year. You can fix this today.\n\nCTA: \"Are you letting calls go to voicemail, or do you answer every single ring?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: This simple phone habit turned a 7pm call into a $480K listing in 48 hours 📞\nHASHTAGS: #realestate #realtor #phonecalls #listings #productivity\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"People don't want to leave voicemails about six-figure decisions — they want a human voice right now.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Hit the \"$480,000\" number hard with emphasis and slight pause\n2. Speed up during the brand intro, then slow down for mirror moment in setup\n3. Direct eye contact during the final CTA question — lean slightly forward",

Completely rewrote CTA from passive 'track what happens' to three concrete steps: disable silence feature, answer for 7 days, document results. Made it impossible to misunderstand what to do next.",
