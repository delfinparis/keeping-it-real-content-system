  "polished_script": "HOOK: While you're planning holiday breaks, someone else is planning to bury you. [ON-SCREEN: \"Someone is planning to BURY YOU\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Every December, same story. Market slows down, competitors vanish, and you tell yourself you'll go hard come January first. [ON-SCREEN: \"EVERY DECEMBER...\"] Paul Salter, mindset coach to seven-figure producers, says that thinking is exactly what keeps you average. [ON-SCREEN: \"Paul Salter - Mindset Coach\"]\n\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what the top 5% know that everyone else ignores.\n\nINSIGHT: Paul calls these next few months \"separation season\" — not downtime, separation season. [ON-SCREEN: \"SEPARATION SEASON\"] While 80% of agents use holidays as an excuse, the elite 5% use them as a weapon. [ON-SCREEN: \"80% make excuses / 5% make moves\"] They're calling past clients who closed six months ago. They're door-knocking expired listings on Saturday mornings when zero competition exists. [ON-SCREEN: \"ZERO COMPETITION\"] They're building the pipeline that explodes in Q1 while everyone else scrambles in January.\n\nREFRAME: The gap between you and them doesn't widen in January — it widens right now. Every December you coast, you're not losing one month, you're losing the compounding advantage of being the only agent still showing up. [ON-SCREEN: \"BE THE ONLY ONE SHOWING UP\"]\n\nCTA: \"Are you treating December as separation season or vacation season — which one?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: While 80% of agents coast through December, the top 5% use it as separation season. Which are you? 🎯\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #SeparationSeason #AgentTips #HolidayHustle #RealEstateSuccess\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"The gap between you and them doesn't widen in January — it widens right now.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver HOOK with intensity and slight pause after \"someone else\"\n2. Emphasize contrast words: \"80% vs 5%\", \"excuse vs weapon\", \"December vs January\" \n3. Lean forward slightly during REFRAME for intimacy and urgency",
