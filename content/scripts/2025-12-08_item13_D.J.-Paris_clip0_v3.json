  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your listing descriptions are losing you showings before buyers even call. [ON-SCREEN: Your listings sound like everyone else's]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You spend hours writing listing descriptions, but they all sound the same. \"Updated kitchen, spacious bedrooms, move-in ready.\" Buyers scroll right past because nothing grabs them. [ON-SCREEN: \"Updated kitchen, spacious bedrooms\"] You're competing with thousands of agents using the exact same tired phrases.\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what I discovered when I built an AI tool that thinks like a bestselling novelist.\n\nINSIGHT: Instead of telling the AI to write like a real estate agent, I gave it a different identity: \"You're a bestselling novelist and an award-winning investigative journalist.\" [ON-SCREEN: Novelist + Journalist = Better listings] A novelist knows sensory details. A journalist leads with story, not specs. So instead of \"updated kitchen,\" it writes \"the kind of kitchen where Sunday mornings stretch into afternoons.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Sunday mornings stretch into afternoons\"] Instead of \"spacious master,\" it writes \"a bedroom that feels like your own private retreat.\" The AI started creating descriptions that sound like places people actually want to live.\n\nREFRAME: Most agents write listings like they're checking compliance boxes. Top producers write them like the opening chapter of a book buyers can't put down. [ON-SCREEN: Form vs. Story] You can do this today without any AI tool.\n\nCTA: \"Read your last listing description out loud right now — does it sound like a form or like someone's dream home?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop writing boring listing descriptions that sound like everyone else's. Here's the novelist trick that gets more showings 📚\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #ListingTips #RealEstateMarketing #AgentTips #RealEstateAgent\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Top producers write listings like the opening chapter of a book buyers can't put down.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: 1) Emphasize \"losing you showings\" in hook with concern in voice 2) Slow down on the novelist/journalist reveal for impact 3) Pause after \"Sunday mornings\" quote to let it land",
