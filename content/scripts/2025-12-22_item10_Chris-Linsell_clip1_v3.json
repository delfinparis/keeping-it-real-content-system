Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Picture this: Retirees want to compare Phoenix, Boise, and Raleigh. [ON-SCREEN: 3 Cities, 1 Client] Investors need cap rates across three states. And you're stuck saying \"let me refer you out\" because you can't pull comps outside your market. [ON-SCREEN: \"Let me refer you...\"] You lose the client. Someone else closes the deal.\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what top agents figured out while you're waiting for NAR to fix it.\n\nINSIGHT: Chris Linsell, real estate tech analyst, just called for a national MLS system. [ON-SCREEN: Chris Linsell, Tech Analyst] But smart agents aren't waiting. They're buying secondary MLS access in their top three referral markets for fifty bucks a month each. [ON-SCREEN: $50/month = Access] They're using Zillow's API to pull national comps in under sixty seconds. [ON-SCREEN: 60 Seconds = Nationwide Comps] Most importantly, they're staying the primary contact, not becoming the handoff guy. [ON-SCREEN: Primary Contact vs. Handoff]\n\nREFRAME: Three agents in offices just like yours already have Phoenix access, Nashville access, Denver access. They're closing the deals you're referring out. This isn't a technology problem anymore — it's a decision problem.\n\nCTA: \"What's the number one market you refer clients to — drop it in the comments?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop losing buyers at your MLS boundary.

Replaced vague CTA ('what would your pipeline look like?') with 5-step process agents can execute before their next team meeting.
