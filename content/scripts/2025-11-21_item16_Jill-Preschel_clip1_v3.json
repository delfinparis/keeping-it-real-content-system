  "polished_script": "HOOK: The clients you reject will make you more money than the ones you accept. [ON-SCREEN: REJECT > ACCEPT]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You see them walk in — eight million liquid, needs to close in thirty days. Every agent in the room starts salivating. You're thinking \"jackpot.\" You take the listing, chase the deal, work nights and weekends. [ON-SCREEN: $8M CASH BUYER] Then it implodes at attorney review. Or worse — they sue you six months later. Sound familiar? \n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Jill Preschel does differently — and she's closed over two billion in luxury Manhattan deals.\n\nINSIGHT: Jill told me: \"Just because someone has the budget and an urgent need doesn't mean you should move forward.\" [ON-SCREEN: BUDGET ≠ READY] Here's her filter: She's not asking if they CAN buy. She's asking if they're actually READY to buy. Because urgency without clarity is a lawsuit waiting to happen. Budget without alignment is a deal that dies in due diligence. [ON-SCREEN: URGENCY + NO CLARITY = LAWSUIT] She's not gatekeeping — she's protecting her reputation. And that restraint gets her the next referral from developers who know she only brings serious buyers.\n\nREFRAME: Most agents think their job is closing every lead. Top producers know their job is closing the RIGHT lead. When you say no to wrong-fit clients, you get invited to tables where the right ones sit.\n\nCTA: \"What's the last deal you chased that you KNEW wasn't right?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The $2B agent who says NO to $8M cash buyers (and why you should too) 💰❌\nHASHTAGS: #realestate #luxuryrealestate #realestateagent #agentmindset #businessdevelopment\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Urgency without clarity is a lawsuit waiting to happen.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Emphasize \"REJECT\" vs \"ACCEPT\" in hook with hand gestures. [2] Lean in during the 15-second re-hook for intimacy. [3] Slow down on \"urgency without clarity\" line for screenshot moment.",
