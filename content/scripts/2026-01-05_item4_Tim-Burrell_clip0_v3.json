  "polished_script": "HOOK: You're negotiating blind while your competition knows exactly how you'll respond. [ON-SCREEN: NEGOTIATING BLIND]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You walk into every deal knowing the property details, the comps, the market conditions. But you know nothing about the human sitting across from you. [ON-SCREEN: YOU KNOW THE PROPERTY] Meanwhile, top producers like Tim Burrell — attorney, contractor, RE/MAX Hall of Fame — are studying something completely different. [ON-SCREEN: TOP PRODUCERS STUDY PEOPLE]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: And this intelligence gap is costing you deals.\n\nINSIGHT: Here's Tim's process. Before every negotiation, he feeds the other agent's name into AI. [ON-SCREEN: AGENT NAME → AI] Within seconds, he has their transaction history, negotiation patterns, pressure points. \"One of the things that AI does particularly well,\" Tim says, \"is to give you information about the other person.\" [ON-SCREEN: TRANSACTION HISTORY + PATTERNS] Not generic research — specific intel. How aggressively they counter, what concessions they make, where they fold. [ON-SCREEN: HOW THEY NEGOTIATE] It's like having their playbook before the game starts.\n\nREFRAME: While you're guessing their next move, they already know yours. You can start doing this today — take any agent's name, run it through ChatGPT with public transaction data, ask what patterns emerge. [ON-SCREEN: TRY THIS TODAY]\n\nCTA: \"Are you researching properties or people — which gets more of your prep time?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop negotiating blind. Top agents research the PERSON, not just the property. Here's how Tim Burrell does it.\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #Negotiation #AI #RealtorTips #KeepingItReal\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"It's like having their playbook before the game starts.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Emphasize \"blind\" vs \"exactly\" in hook for contrast [2] Slow down on Tim's quote — let it land [3] Direct eye contact on CTA question, pause for response",
