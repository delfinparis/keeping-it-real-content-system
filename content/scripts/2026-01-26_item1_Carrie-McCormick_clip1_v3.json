  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your buyers aren't rejecting the house. They're rejecting you. [ON-SCREEN: BUYERS AREN'T REJECTING THE HOUSE]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Carrie McCormick — top 1% luxury producer in Chicago — just told me the real reason deals die. And it has nothing to do with price, location, or market conditions. [ON-SCREEN: CARRIE MCCORMICK - TOP 1% CHICAGO LUXURY] You've been there: perfect showing, engaged buyers, then radio silence. You're blaming the market, the property, their financing. \n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what's actually happening that most agents never realize.\n\nINSIGHT: Here's what Carrie said: \"Buyers don't reject homes. They reject uncertainty.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"BUYERS REJECT UNCERTAINTY\" - CARRIE MCCORMICK] Here's how this plays out: Carrie's presenting a $2.1M listing. Buyer asks why it's priced there. [ON-SCREEN: $2.1M LISTING] Average agent says: \"Market analysis supports it.\" Carrie says: \"Two comps closed 90 days ago at $1.95M. Since then, inventory dropped 40% in this zip code. We priced at $2.1M because we're launching with a 72-hour social blitz, broker event Tuesday, and if we don't get action in 10 days, we adjust.\" [ON-SCREEN: CERTAINTY = CONFIDENCE] One agent gave doubt. One gave direction.\n\nREFRAME: So when buyers ghost after showings, it's not the house. You gave them a price without a plan. You can fix this today by building certainty into every conversation.\n\nCTA: \"Do you give prices or do you give plans — which one?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The real reason buyers walk away (it's not what you think) 👆\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorTips #LuxuryRealEstate #SalesStrategy #RealEstateAgent\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Buyers don't reject homes. They reject uncertainty.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver hook with slower pace for impact — pause after \"house\" \n2. Speed up during Carrie's specific example to show contrast with typical agent response\n3. Direct eye contact during reframe — this is the \"aha moment\"",
