  "polished_script": "HOOK: The REALTOR of the Year doesn't check lead metrics first thing in the morning. [ON-SCREEN: REALTOR OF THE YEAR]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You wake up, grab your phone, and immediately dive into numbers. Leads generated. Conversion rates. Pipeline metrics. You're doing everything right on paper, but you still feel burned out and disconnected from why you started. [ON-SCREEN: BURNED OUT?] Sound familiar? You're grinding harder than ever but feeling less fulfilled than when you began.\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Connie Mahan does instead — and it's kept her energized for 25 years.\n\nINSIGHT: Connie Mahan runs an independent brokerage in Central Florida, trains agents, and was named REALTOR of the Year. [ON-SCREEN: 25 YEARS IN BUSINESS] Every morning, she reminds herself of this: \"We are so lucky to get to do what we do — help people honestly and ethically make the largest decision of their life.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"IT'S A PRIVILEGE\"] She told me about a first-generation buyer who was terrified, convinced she'd be rejected. Connie walked her through every step — pre-approval, inspection, closing. That buyer cried at the settlement table. Connie said, \"That's when I realized this isn't a job. It's a privilege.\"\n\nREFRAME: Most burned-out agents aren't doing too much — they're feeling too little. When real estate becomes purely transactional, you lose what made you good at it. The secret isn't better systems. It's never forgetting why this work matters.\n\nCTA: \"When's the last time you texted a past client just to check how they're loving their home?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The morning habit that keeps top agents energized for decades (it's not what you think) 🏠✨\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorMindset #RealEstateAgent #KeepingItReal #RealtorLife\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Most burned-out agents aren't doing too much — they're feeling too little.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver the hook with genuine surprise in your voice, pause after \"doesn't check\"\n2. Slow down and get emotional on Connie's quote about privilege — this is the heart\n3. Make direct eye contact during the reframe section — this is the truth bomb moment",
