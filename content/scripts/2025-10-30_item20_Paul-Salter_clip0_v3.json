  "polished_script": "HOOK: Work-life balance is destroying your real estate business. [ON-SCREEN: \"Work-Life Balance Is A LIE\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You promise your family you'll be home by six. You miss it again. Then the guilt hits. So you work distracted the next day, sneaking emails at dinner, half-present everywhere you go. [ON-SCREEN: \"Sound Familiar?\"] Sound familiar? Mindset coach Paul Salter says you're solving the wrong problem entirely.\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: Here's what he told me that changed everything.\n\nINSIGHT: \"The goal is not to seek balance in entrepreneurship. That bullshit concept that doesn't exist. You need to seek alignment.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"BALANCE vs ALIGNMENT\"] Stop pretending you can build a seven-figure business on leftover hours. Real alignment looks like this: One top agent told his wife, \"Tuesday and Thursday nights, I'm working until nine. Saturday mornings, I'm prospecting until noon. But Sunday? Phone's off. I'm completely yours.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"+30% Production\"] No fake promises. No sneaking work. His production jumped thirty percent, and his marriage got stronger.\n\nREFRAME: When you stop pretending and start aligning, your family knows what to expect, your team knows what you need, and you stop carrying guilt into every conversation. Alignment isn't balance—it's honesty about the season you're in.\n\nCTA: \"Are you ready to have that alignment conversation with your family tonight—yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop chasing work-life balance. Start building alignment. Your family AND your business will thank you. 💯\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateAgent #WorkLifeBalance #Entrepreneurship #RealEstateTips #AgentMindset\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Alignment isn't balance—it's honesty about the season you're in.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver HOOK with frustrated energy, then shift to conversational for brand intro\n2. Emphasize \"thirty percent\" and pause after \"Phone's off\" for impact\n3. Maintain direct eye contact during the final CTA question",
