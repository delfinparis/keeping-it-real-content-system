Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're in a heated negotiation. Both sides are dug in. Egos are flaring. And you're thinking — if I back down now, I look weak and lose leverage. That's exactly how 90% of deals fall apart. [ON-SCREEN: \"90% OF DEALS FALL APART\"]\n\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But Tim Burrell — who's closed thousands of deals in Raleigh — says that's exactly backwards.\n\nINSIGHT: Here's what Tim told me: \"One of the simplest ways to get the conflict to be over is to apologize. It shows strength, not weakness.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"APOLOGIZING = STRENGTH\"] Think about it. When you say \"Hey, I could've handled that better\" — you immediately defuse the tension. [ON-SCREEN: \"DEFUSE TENSION INSTANTLY\"] You signal you care more about closing the deal than winning the argument. And here's what happens — the other agent almost always softens back. Because nobody expects it. [ON-SCREEN: \"OTHER AGENT SOFTENS\"]\n\nREFRAME: So next time a negotiation heats up, ask yourself: Do I want to win this argument or close this deal? Because the agents who swallow their ego? They're the ones getting callbacks and closing deals everyone else walked away from.\n\nCTA: \"Are you ready to try this in your next heated negotiation — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The counterintuitive negotiation move that closes more deals 🤝 Tim Burrell breaks down why apologizing first shows strength, not weakness\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #Negotiation #RealtorTips #KeepingItReal #RealEstateAgent\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"One of the simplest ways to get the conflict to be over is to apologize. It shows strength, not weakness.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Deliver hook with confident conviction, slight pause before \"wins\" [2] Emphasize \"thousands of deals\" with authority [3] Lean in during Tim's quote for intimacy, then pull back for the reframe",
