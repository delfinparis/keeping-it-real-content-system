  "polished_script": "HOOK: The agent who just closed three deals in your zip code isn't smarter than you. [ON-SCREEN: \"They're not smarter than you\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're sitting there watching other agents close deals, thinking they must know something you don't. Maybe they have better scripts, better leads, better systems. You're researching the perfect CRM while they're booking appointments. You're perfecting your elevator pitch while they're signing contracts. [ON-SCREEN: \"You're overthinking, they're outworking\"] \n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Kristee Leonard — who moves fifty million a year in Austin luxury — told me that changes everything.\n\nINSIGHT: She said, \"You don't have to be the smartest person in the room. You just have to outwork the smartest person in the room.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"OUTWORK the smartest person\"] While other agents are tweaking their Instagram bio for the third time this week, she's making fifty more calls. While they're overthinking their follow-up sequence, she's knocking doors at seven PM on a Tuesday. [ON-SCREEN: \"50 more calls\"] The ones who win aren't the ones with the best systems — they're the ones who show up when showing up is uncomfortable. [ON-SCREEN: \"Show up when it's uncomfortable\"]\n\nREFRAME: So if you've been thinking you need one more course, one more certification, one more mentor — you don't. You need ten more conversations this week than you had last week. That's the only gap that matters.\n\nCTA: \"Are you ready to outwork your market this week — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: You don't need to be smarter. You need to outwork them. 💪 What's stopping you from making those calls?\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealEstateAgent #RealEstateTips #Outwork #KeepingItReal\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You don't have to be the smartest person in the room. You just have to outwork the smartest person in the room.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver HOOK with conviction and slight pause after \"zip code\" for emphasis\n2. Slow down on the Kristee Leonard quote — let it land with weight\n3. Eye contact intensifies during \"show up when showing up is uncomfortable\" — make it personal",
