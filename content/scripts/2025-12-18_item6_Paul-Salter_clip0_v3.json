  "polished_script": "HOOK: That client criticism that ruined your whole week? You believed it before they said it. [ON-SCREEN: \"You already believed it\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know that feeling when a client says something about your response time or follow-through and it just... stings? Like, really stings? Not just annoying—it actually ruins your day. You get defensive, maybe even angry. [ON-SCREEN: \"Why does it sting so much?\"] Most agents think it's because the client was rude or unfair. \n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But mindset coach Paul Salter just revealed why criticism hits some agents like a truck while others brush it off completely.\n\nINSIGHT: Here's what Paul told me: \"When a behavior or something said by another person triggers you, it's a mirror of a part of yourself you don't like.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"It's a mirror\"] Think about it—that comment about your response time? Deep down, you know you've been dropping balls. The follow-through criticism? You're already ashamed of deals that fell apart. [ON-SCREEN: \"You already know it's true\"] Most agents fight the feedback. Top producers use it as a roadmap for where to improve next.\n\nREFRAME: This changes everything. Your defensiveness isn't protecting you—it's keeping you stuck. Because you can't fix what you won't acknowledge. [ON-SCREEN: \"The trigger shows you the work\"] That criticism is actually showing you exactly where your next breakthrough is hiding.\n\nCTA: \"What criticism have you been fighting the hardest lately?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The criticism that stings the most reveals where your next breakthrough is hiding 🪞\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #Mindset #AgentTips #Growth #KeepingItReal\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Your defensiveness isn't protecting you—it's keeping you stuck.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Deliver hook with slight pause after \"week\"—let it land. [2] Say Paul's quote slower with emphasis on \"mirror\"—this is the key insight. [3] Lock eye contact during reframe section—this is the mindset shift moment.",
