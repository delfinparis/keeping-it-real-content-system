Stop lying to yourself about what building an empire actually takes. Here's what alignment actually looks like: One agent I know told his wife, 'Tuesday and Thursday nights, I'm at the office until nine. Saturday mornings, I'm prospecting until noon. But Sunday? Phone's off. I'm yours.' No more fake promises. No more sneaking emails at dinner. His production went up thirty percent. His marriage got better. That's alignment. You pick your seasons. You communicate the truth. You stop pretending you can build a seven-figure business on leftover hours.",
