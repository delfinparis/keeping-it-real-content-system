Because while 80% of agents are using the holidays as an excuse, the top 5% are using it as a weapon. They're calling past clients who closed six months ago. They're texting sphere contacts who haven't heard from them since summer. They're door-knocking expired listings on Saturday mornings when no one else will. They're building the pipeline that explodes in Q1 while everyone else is scrambling. The gap between you and them? It doesn't widen in January. It widens right now.",
