      "text": "In the book, the main character gets outbid eleven times. Two years of house hunting. So when she hears about a home that's not even listed yet? She doesn't call her agent. She stalks the owners at the grocery store. Shows up at their kid's soccer game. And when that doesn't work, she escalates. But here's what agents told Marisa: they've seen buyers offer to pay for the seller's divorce attorney. Promise to name their baby after the seller. One guy tried to buy the house next door just to be closer. Because as Marisa puts it: 'It's really how far would someone go to get the house, right?' You're not managing transactions. You're managing people at their absolute breaking point — watching the biggest investment they'll ever make slip away for the eleventh time.",
      "production_note": "Split screen: Marisa speaking on one side, dramatic B-roll on the other — woman peering through windows, obsessively scrolling listings at 2am, showing up uninvited at seller's door. Use thriller-style music bed. Text overlay of specific examples: 'Paid for divorce attorney' / 'Named baby after seller' / 'Bought house next door'."

      "timing": "0:38-0:50",
      "text": "Every agent watching this has that one buyer story. The one who showed up uninvited. The one who offered cash they didn't actually have. The one who made you sit in your car after the showing and wonder if you should've been a therapist instead. That's not bad clients. That's what happens when you don't draw the line early.",
      "production_note": "Return to Marisa's face, nodding knowingly. Cut to agent sitting alone in car after showing, exhaling deeply — the weight of it all. Brief flash of agent's phone blowing up with texts."
