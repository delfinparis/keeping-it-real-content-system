Did any client choose you because of your broker? Or did they choose you because you answered the phone, knew the neighborhood, showed up on time, and made them feel heard? The brokerage didn't build that trust. You did. The logo on your business card is a placeholder. Your name, your reputation, your follow-through—that's the brand.",
