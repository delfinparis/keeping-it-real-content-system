  "polished_script": "HOOK: AI now knows which agents will quit before their broker does. [ON-SCREEN: AI PREDICTS AGENT DEPARTURES]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Look, I've recruited over 2,000 agents in 15 years. I've tried every system, every CRM, every \"game-changing\" tool that promised to revolutionize recruiting. [ON-SCREEN: 2,000+ AGENTS RECRUITED] Most of the time, you're throwing darts in the dark—cold calling agents who aren't even thinking about moving, while the ones ready to jump are talking to your competitors.\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But I just found something that completely flips the script on agent recruiting.\n\nINSIGHT: It's called Corded, and here's what blew my mind: it scans dozens of data points for every agent in your market—production trends, social media activity, career patterns—and flags exactly who's likely to move. [ON-SCREEN: SCANS DOZENS OF VARIABLES] But here's the crazy part: it reads YOUR brokerage website, learns what you actually offer, then tells you exactly what to say to each specific agent. [ON-SCREEN: CUSTOM SCRIPTS FOR EACH AGENT] As one recruiter told me: \"Corded's AI tells me exactly what to say based on that agent's needs and what my brokerage can offer. It even writes the emails.\" This isn't just lead generation—this is recruitment on full autopilot.\n\nREFRAME: Think about this: while you're guessing who might be interested, your competitor has a list of agents ready to move with the exact words that'll close them. You can start using this today at corded.io.\n\nCTA: \"Are you still recruiting blind, or are you ready to let AI do the heavy lifting?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: AI tool predicts which agents will switch brokerages + writes your recruiting scripts. Game changer for team leaders! 🤖\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateRecruiting #AIForRealtors #TeamBuilding #RealEstateTech #AgentRecruiting\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"While you're guessing who might be interested, your competitor has a list of agents ready to move with the exact words that'll close them.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Emphasize \"before their broker does\" in hook with slight pause. [2] Speed up during the data points list to build momentum. [3] Lean in slightly when delivering the quote—make it feel like insider intel.",
