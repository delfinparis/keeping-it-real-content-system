  "polished_script": "HOOK: Stop preparing. Start failing. [ON-SCREEN: STOP PREPARING]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You've been licensed for months. Maybe years. You're still watching YouTube videos, taking courses, waiting to feel ready. Meanwhile, other agents who started after you are already closing deals. [ON-SCREEN: STILL WAITING TO FEEL READY?]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Connie Mahan discovered when she went from restaurant management to REALTOR of the Year.\n\nINSIGHT: Connie told me: \"The best advice was literally to get in and do and the rest will figure itself out.\" [ON-SCREEN: GET IN AND DO] Not take another class. Not shadow someone for six months. Just start. Here's what actually happens: You take your first listing. You mess up the photos. You panic about the contract. You call someone. You learn. [ON-SCREEN: YOU LEARN BY DOING] And suddenly you've got a closing under your belt. The agents waiting for perfect? They're still waiting. The ones who started messy? They're closing deals.\n\nREFRAME: You're not behind because you don't know everything. You're behind because you're still studying instead of doing. The market rewards reps, not readiness. You can call one expired listing today and learn more in five minutes than five hours of training.\n\nCTA: \"Are you finally ready to stop preparing and start doing — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Restaurant manager → REALTOR of the Year. Her secret? Stop preparing, start doing. The market rewards reps, not readiness. 🎯\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorTips #RealEstateAgent #RealtorLife #RealEstateSuccess\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"The market rewards reps, not readiness.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver HOOK with sharp, staccato emphasis on \"Stop\" and \"Start\" \n2. Slow down slightly during the quote in INSIGHT for maximum impact\n3. Lean forward during CTA with direct eye contact to camera",
