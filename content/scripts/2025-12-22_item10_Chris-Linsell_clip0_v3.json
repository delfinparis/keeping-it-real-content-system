  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your MLS has 300 data fields. You use seven. [ON-SCREEN: 300 DATA FIELDS → 7 USED]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You spend hours on CMAs, pulling the same basic comps, using the same tired data points every other agent uses. Meanwhile, you're wondering why your presentations don't wow clients like they used to. [ON-SCREEN: SAME DATA = SAME RESULTS] Real estate tech analyst Chris Linsell just revealed exactly why top producers are pulling away from everyone else.\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: And it's not their personality or hustle — it's their data game.\n\nINSIGHT: Linsell says imagine if NAR committed to being ten times — not ten percent, but ten TIMES — better at data collection and analysis. [ON-SCREEN: 10X DATA COLLECTION] With AI, we could do 100x better at mining insights that are sitting right there, unused. The agents who figure this out are finding days-on-market patterns by school district, price-per-square-foot trends by specific builder, absorption rates by micro-neighborhood. [ON-SCREEN: DOM BY SCHOOL DISTRICT] They're not just winning listings — they're becoming the trusted authority before they even walk in the door.\n\nREFRAME: You think you're competing on relationships and market knowledge. You're actually competing on information asymmetry. The agents mining deeper data layers are making everyone else look basic.\n\nCTA: \"Open your MLS tonight and count how many data fields you actually use — what number did you get?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Most agents use 7 data fields out of 300 available. Top producers are mining the other 293 to become market authorities. What are you missing?\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateData #MLSHacks #AgentTips #RealEstateTech #PropertyData\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You think you're competing on relationships — you're actually competing on information asymmetry.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Emphasize the number contrast (300 vs 7) with vocal punch\n2. Slow down on \"information asymmetry\" — let it land\n3. Direct eye contact during the final question to camera",
