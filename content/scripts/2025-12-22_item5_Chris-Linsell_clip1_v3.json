Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: If you've watched part-timers ghost clients mid-transaction while you're building a real business, you know exactly what I'm talking about. [ON-SCREEN: \"Part-timers ghosting clients\"] Chris Linsell analyzes real estate tech for a living, and he thinks NAR's biggest opportunity isn't member perks or marketing. [ON-SCREEN: \"Chris Linsell - RE Tech Analyst\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: Here's the part that'll make some agents uncomfortable.\n\nINSIGHT: He says NAR should partner with state regulators to raise licensing standards before people get in — not just police them after they screw up. [ON-SCREEN: \"RAISE licensing standards\"] Right now, Alabama requires sixty hours to get licensed. Georgia? Seventy-five hours. [ON-SCREEN: \"AL: 60 hours / GA: 75 hours\"] That's less time than becoming a licensed barber. [ON-SCREEN: \"Less than a BARBER license\"] But these people are representing someone's four-hundred-thousand-dollar life decision. Quote: \"The barrier to entry to our industry has to be a little bit higher.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"The barrier to entry has to be higher\"]\n\nREFRAME: If you've earned your stripes in this business, this isn't controversial — it's overdue. The profession doesn't earn respect until it demands competence at the door.\n\nCTA: \"Do you think licensing standards should be higher — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Real estate tech analyst says the quiet part out loud about REALTOR licensing standards 👀\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #REALTOR #RealEstateAgent #PropertyProfessionals #RealEstateTips\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"The profession doesn't earn respect until it demands competence at the door.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Pause after \"uncomfortable\" in re-hook for emphasis\n2. Slow down on the specific hour requirements (60, 75) to let numbers land\n3. Direct eye contact on the quote — this is the money moment",
