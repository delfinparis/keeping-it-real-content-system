  "polished_script": "HOOK: Most agents never make their first cold call because they're terrified of one word. [ON-SCREEN: \"Terrified of ONE word\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know you should be prospecting. You've got the scripts, maybe even the leads. But every time you pick up that phone, you freeze. Your brain starts spinning stories about what they'll think, how you'll sound, whether you'll look desperate. [ON-SCREEN: \"Your brain spins stories\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what a guy closing 100+ deals a year in Manhattan taught me about that fear.\n\nINSIGHT: Eithan Davidov built his entire New York City business on cold prospecting. [ON-SCREEN: \"100+ deals/year NYC\"] And he tells his team exactly this: \"The worst that happens is they say no, and you move the F on.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"They say NO. You move ON.\"] That's it. Not \"they'll think I'm annoying.\" Not \"I'll sound desperate.\" They say no. You move on. [ON-SCREEN: \"NO = Data point\"] Most agents treat rejection like a referendum on their worth. Eithan treats it like a data point. He adds value — market intel, neighborhood updates, hyper-local insights. But the real secret? He knows rejection isn't the barrier. Fear of rejection is.\n\nREFRAME: Think about it this way: Make ten calls, get nine nos, you still have one yes in your pipeline. [ON-SCREEN: \"9 NOs + 1 YES = Deal\"] Make zero calls because you're afraid of nine nos? You have zero deals. The fortune isn't in avoiding rejection — it's in moving past it faster than everyone else.\n\nCTA: \"Are you making those calls, or are you still letting fear win?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The one word that stops agents from prospecting (and how top producers handle it) 📞\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #ColdCalling #Prospecting #RealtorTips #Mindset\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"The fortune isn't in avoiding rejection — it's in moving past it faster than everyone else.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: 1) Pause after \"one word\" in hook for maximum curiosity, 2) Say the F-bomb quote with Eithan's confidence and slight smile, 3) Lean forward during the 10 calls math breakdown for intimacy",
