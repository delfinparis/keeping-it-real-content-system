  "polished_script": "HOOK: Insurance is killing more deals than bad inspections right now. [ON-SCREEN: Insurance > Bad Inspections]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know that sinking feeling when everything's perfect — buyer's pre-approved, inspection's clean, appraisal came in — and then they walk anyway? [ON-SCREEN: Pre-approved ✓ Clean Inspection ✓ Deal Dies ✗] Jeff Biebuyck moves luxury properties in Calabasas and Hidden Hills, top 1% nationwide, and he's watching qualified buyers disappear at the finish line every single week. \n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's the part most agents never see coming.\n\nINSIGHT: Here's what Jeff told me: \"Insurability became an issue with affordability. We've seen a massive shift in our market.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Insurability = Affordability Issue\"] Translation? That $2 million home now costs $25,000 a year just to insure. [ON-SCREEN: $2M Home = $25K Insurance] In fire zones, premiums tripled overnight. In flood zones, policies disappeared entirely. That's an extra $2,000 monthly payment your buyer never budgeted for. [ON-SCREEN: +$2,000/Month Surprise]\n\nREFRAME: Which means you can't just know comps anymore — you need to know carriers. You need to set insurance expectations before the offer, not after. Most agents deal with this during escrow. Top producers handle it during pre-approval.\n\nCTA: \"Are you having the insurance conversation before or after the offer?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Why qualified buyers are walking from perfect deals (it's not what you think) 🏠💸\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #Insurance #RealEstateAgent #PropertyInsurance #RealEstateTips\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You can't just know comps anymore — you need to know carriers.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: 1) Emphasize \"right now\" in hook with urgency 2) Slow down on the $25K insurance number for impact 3) Direct eye contact during the contrast structure in REFRAME",
