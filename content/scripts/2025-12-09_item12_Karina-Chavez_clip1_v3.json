  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your clients don't actually understand what they bought. [ON-SCREEN: \"They don't understand what they bought\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Karina Chavez is a top 1% producer in Albuquerque who watched the 2008 crash destroy her community. [ON-SCREEN: \"Top 1% Producer - Albuquerque\"] Interest-only loans, predatory lenders, families who thought they understood their mortgage but had no clue what they'd actually signed. Sound familiar? Your clients are sitting ducks for the same confusion. [ON-SCREEN: \"Your clients = sitting ducks\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Karina does that most agents never think of.\n\nINSIGHT: She prints every single loan document and goes page by page with her clients. [ON-SCREEN: \"Prints EVERY loan document\"] Fixed rate means it never changes. Here's your taxes. Here's your insurance. Everything. Not because she's a loan officer — because she learned your job isn't done at closing. [ON-SCREEN: \"Your job ≠ done at closing\"] Years later, one client called panicking about a medical crisis. Karina reminded her: \"This is what your house is for. This is what all the sacrifices have been for.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"This is what your house is for\"] That equity becomes their safety net.\n\nREFRAME: You're not selling houses — you're selling the thing that catches people when they fall. But only if they actually understand what they own. [ON-SCREEN: \"You're selling their safety net\"] That's the difference between a transaction and a relationship that lasts decades.\n\nCTA: \"Could your clients explain their mortgage to their kids right now — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Most agents think their job ends at closing. Top 1% producers know better. Here's what Karina Chavez does differently 👇\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorTips #ClientEducation #MortgageEducation #RealEstateAgent\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You're not selling houses — you're selling the thing that catches people when they fall.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Emphasize \"every single\" in the loan document line with slight pause for impact\n2. Deliver the client quote \"This is what your house is for\" with warmth and conviction\n3. Slow down on \"safety net\" — this is the money shot that viewers will remember",
