  "polished_script": "HOOK: New agents study for six months. Top producers start selling in six days. [ON-SCREEN: 6 MONTHS vs 6 DAYS]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're waiting to feel ready. Studying scripts, watching courses, perfecting your elevator pitch. Meanwhile, that agent who got licensed last week? They just closed their first deal. [ON-SCREEN: WAITING TO FEEL READY]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Connie Mahan — REALTOR of the Year in Central Florida — learned that changed everything.\n\nINSIGHT: Someone gave Connie the best advice of her career: \"Get in and do. The rest will figure itself out.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"GET IN AND DO\"] Not study more. Not wait until you're comfortable. Do. She didn't know every answer when she started door-knocking. But those conversations taught her objection handling better than any course ever could. [ON-SCREEN: DOING CREATES KNOWING] Open houses taught her buyer psychology. Expired listings taught her confidence. The doing created the knowing.\n\nREFRAME: Here's the truth nobody tells you: your first ten conversations will be terrible — and that's exactly the point. [ON-SCREEN: FIRST 10 = TERRIBLE] You can't learn swimming from a book. You're not unprepared, you're just untested.\n\nCTA: \"Before you watch another training video, do one thing that scares you today. What will it be?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop studying. Start doing. The rest will figure itself out. 🏠\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #NewAgents #RealEstateSuccess #RealtorTips #RealEstateSales\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You're not unprepared, you're just untested.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Emphasize the contrast in HOOK with vocal punch on \"six months\" vs \"six days\"\n2. Slow down slightly on \"The doing created the knowing\" for impact\n3. Direct eye contact on the CTA question — make it feel personal",
