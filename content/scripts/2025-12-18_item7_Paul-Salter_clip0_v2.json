      "text": "Because here's what actually happened in that meeting. An investor questioned your market analysis. You felt your authority challenged. Your chest tightened. You interrupted with data to prove you're right. You won the argument. You lost the relationship. Paul's reframe: 'Feeling attacked doesn't mean you're weak; it means something inside of you is asking for attention.' That tightness in your chest? That's not the problem. Ignoring it and bulldozing forward — that's the pattern that's bleeding talent.",
      "production_note": "Cut to Paul speaking. Key phrase 'asking for attention' on screen. Quick cuts: chest touch (physical cue), finger pointing across table, agent packing box, closed door."

      "timing": "0:38-0:50",
      "text": "Paul teaches a 90-second regulation technique: Notice the tightness. Name it silently — 'I feel threatened.' Take three breaths. Then ask one question: 'What if they're right?' That pause — between feeling and reacting — that's where you keep your top performers.",
      "production_note": "Slow zoom on Paul demonstrating: hand on chest, eyes closed briefly, calm exhale. Text overlay: '1. Notice. 2. Name. 3. Breathe. 4. Ask.' Shift to grounded, teaching tone."

      "timing": "0:50-0:60",
      "text": "Before your next team meeting — tomorrow, this week, whenever it is — set a timer on your phone for 90 seconds. Practice this sequence once. Notice, name, breathe, ask. So when someone challenges your strategy mid-meeting, you have a pattern that isn't defense. You have a choice.",
