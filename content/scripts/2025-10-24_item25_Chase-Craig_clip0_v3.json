  "polished_script": "HOOK: New agents think the entire real estate game is rigged against them. [ON-SCREEN: \"The game is rigged...\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're drowning in interest rates, inventory shortages, what Zillow's doing, what your competitors are posting on social media. Every day feels like you're fighting forces completely outside your control. [ON-SCREEN: \"Drowning in things you can't control\"] Chase Craig felt the same way when he was making twelve dollars an hour at Home Depot. Now he's done over 6,000 transactions and two billion in sales. [ON-SCREEN: \"6,000 transactions, $2B in sales\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what he figured out that most agents never do.\n\nINSIGHT: Chase ignores all the noise and built his empire on exactly three controllables. [ON-SCREEN: \"3 controllables only\"] First — his database. He texts every single past client on their birthday, no exceptions. [ON-SCREEN: \"Text every client's birthday\"] Second — his response time. Every lead gets called back in under five minutes, period. [ON-SCREEN: \"Under 5 minutes response time\"] Third — his daily actions. Five prospecting calls before he even opens email. [ON-SCREEN: \"5 calls before email\"] That's it. Everything else is just noise stealing your focus.\n\nREFRAME: When you're spiraling about market conditions or some guru's Twitter post, that's time stolen from the only three things that'll actually get you paid. You can start this today, no matter where you are in your career.\n\nCTA: \"Are you tracking your response time right now — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Chase Craig went from $12/hour to $2B in sales focusing on just 3 things. Here's his formula 👇\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorTips #RealEstateAgent #RealEstateSales #KeepingItReal\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Everything else is just noise stealing your focus.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver the three controllables with distinct pauses between each one for emphasis\n2. Speed up slightly during the noise/distractions part to create contrast with the calm, focused solution\n3. Make direct eye contact during \"You can start this today\" for maximum connection",
