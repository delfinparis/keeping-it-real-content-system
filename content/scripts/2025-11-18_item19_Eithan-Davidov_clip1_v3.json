  "polished_script": "HOOK: You're using AI completely backwards. [ON-SCREEN: \"You're Using AI Wrong\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Most agents dump everything into ChatGPT — \"write my listing description,\" \"create my follow-up sequence\" — and wonder why it sounds like a robot wrote it. You're stuck between sounding fake or spending hours rewriting everything yourself. [ON-SCREEN: \"Sounds Like a Robot Wrote It\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But Eithan Davidov closes over 100 deals a year in Queens, and he cracked the code.\n\nINSIGHT: His rule: \"I use AI to clean up my thoughts instead of generate them.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Clean Up vs. Generate\"] Here's what that looks like — voice memo after a listing appointment, messy and incomplete thoughts about the seller's concerns. Dump it into AI, but ask it to organize, not create. What comes back is YOUR voice, YOUR insights, just structured. [ON-SCREEN: \"Your Voice + Structure\"] Same with follow-up sequences — you write the raw version, the stuff you'd actually say. AI tightens it, finds the gaps, makes it coherent. You stay human, just clearer and faster.\n\nREFRAME: The bottleneck isn't ideas — you have plenty of those. The bottleneck is turning the chaos in your head into something you can actually send. AI as your thought-cleaner? That's the unlock.\n\nCTA: \"Try this today — record a 2-minute voice memo about your last client interaction, transcribe it, and ask AI to organize your thoughts, not rewrite them. What happened when you tried it?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop letting AI write FOR you. Start letting it organize your thoughts. Game changer. 🧠✨\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #AITips #RealtorTips #RealEstateAgent #Productivity\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"I use AI to clean up my thoughts instead of generate them.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Pause after \"completely backwards\" in hook for emphasis\n2. Speed up during brand intro, slow down to let \"100 deals a year\" land\n3. Direct eye contact when delivering the shareable quote about cleaning up vs. generating",
