  "polished_script": "HOOK: You're doing too much, and it's killing your deals. [ON-SCREEN: \"DOING TOO MUCH?\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: I know you're drowning in systems right now. New CRM, AI tools, social media strategies, lead magnets. You're working harder than ever but closing fewer deals than you expected. [ON-SCREEN: \"WORKING HARDER, CLOSING LESS\"] \n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what a 40-year top 1% luxury producer told me that most agents won't want to hear.\n\nINSIGHT: Jay Cannone does exactly three things every morning. Five calls to past clients. Two property previews in person. Follow up on yesterday's leads. That's it. [ON-SCREEN: \"5 CALLS • 2 PREVIEWS • FOLLOW UP\"] He told me: \"Show up means actually walk the properties. Do the work means make the calls before lunch. Be straight means if the house is overpriced, say it.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"SHOW UP • DO THE WORK • BE STRAIGHT\"] Most agents chase complexity because simplicity feels too boring to work. But clients don't buy your marketing stack—they buy your reliability.\n\nREFRAME: If you're six months in and drowning in tactics, stop. Pick three daily non-negotiables. Not ten systems. Three actions that put you in front of people and properties. You can start this tomorrow morning.\n\nCTA: \"Are you ready to simplify and focus on just three daily actions—yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: 40-year top producer's daily routine might surprise you (it's simpler than you think)\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #AgentTips #TopProducer #RealEstateSuccess #KeepingItReal\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Clients don't buy your marketing stack—they buy your reliability.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: 1) Emphasize \"too much\" in hook with slight pause after. 2) Slow down on the three daily actions for clarity. 3) Direct eye contact during the reframe section for authority.",
