  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your buyer just asked if they could write a letter to the seller's dead mother. [ON-SCREEN: \"Write a letter to the seller's DEAD MOTHER\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Bestselling novelist Marisa Kashino thought she was writing fiction about buyers going unhinged in competitive markets. Then a Seattle agent told her that dead mother letter story actually happened. [ON-SCREEN: \"This actually happened\"] You've got buyers losing their minds after getting outbid for the eleventh time, two years of house hunting, watching their biggest investment slip away again and again. [ON-SCREEN: \"Outbid 11 times in 2 years\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what agents told Marisa they're really dealing with.\n\nINSIGHT: She heard about buyers offering to pay for the seller's divorce attorney. Promising to name their baby after the seller. [ON-SCREEN: \"Name their baby after the seller\"] One guy tried to buy the house next door just to be closer. In her book, the character stalks owners at grocery stores, shows up at their kid's soccer games. [ON-SCREEN: \"Stalking at soccer games\"] As Marisa puts it: \"It's really how far would someone go to get the house, right?\" You're not managing transactions — you're managing people at their absolute breaking point. [ON-SCREEN: \"Managing people at breaking point\"]\n\nREFRAME: Every agent has that one buyer story. The uninvited house visits. The cash offers they didn't actually have. The ones that made you wonder if you should've been a therapist instead. That's not bad clients — that's what happens when you don't draw the line early.\n\nCTA: \"Before your next buyer consultation, ask this: 'What's the craziest thing you've considered doing to get a house?' — are you asking boundary questions like this?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: When buyers go unhinged: the boundary question every agent needs to ask 🏠💀 Full episode in bio\nHASHTAGS: #realestate #buyeragent #boundaries #clientmanagement #realestateagent\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You're not managing transactions — you're managing people at their absolute breaking point.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Deliver hook with genuine disbelief/shock. [2] Slow down on \"breaking point\" line for emphasis. [3] Direct eye contact during CTA question — make it conversational.",
