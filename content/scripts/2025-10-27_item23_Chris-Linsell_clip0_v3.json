  "polished_script": "HOOK: One company just bought control of 300,000 real estate agents. [ON-SCREEN: 1 in 5 agents now owned by 1 company]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: If you're fighting for listings right now, your competition just got a billion-dollar tech upgrade they didn't even ask for. Real estate analyst Chris Linsell broke this down perfectly when Compass acquired Anywhere Real Estate — that's Century 21, Coldwell Banker, Better Homes and Gardens, Corcoran, all of them. [ON-SCREEN: Compass + Anywhere = 300K agents]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's the part that should terrify independent agents.\n\nINSIGHT: Chris said it best: \"Imagine one out of every five items at the grocery store all being made by the same company. That's the scale we're talking about here.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"1 in 5 grocery items = same company\"] These agents didn't choose Compass, but now they're getting Compass CRM, AI lead tools, marketing automation, transaction software — the whole stack. [ON-SCREEN: Bob at Century 21 ≠ just Bob anymore] Most agents compete on personality and hustle. These 300,000 agents now compete with AI writing their listings, automated follow-ups, and design teams they never pay for.\n\nREFRAME: You're not competing against Bob from Century 21 anymore. You're competing against Bob plus a tech team worth millions. But here's what you can do today to level the playing field.\n\nCTA: \"Go check your CRM right now — do you have automated follow-up sequences running for every single lead?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Compass just bought 300K agents. Here's how to compete against their billion-dollar tech stack (starting today) 🎯\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #CompassAcquisition #RealEstateAgent #CRM #LeadGeneration\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You're not competing against Bob anymore — you're competing against Bob plus a tech team worth millions.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver the hook with urgency — this is breaking news energy\n2. Slow down on the grocery store quote for maximum impact \n3. Eye contact gets intense on the reframe — this is the \"oh shit\" moment",

Added concrete tech examples in INSIGHT (CRM, AI tools, marketing automation) so viewer knows exactly what 'tech stack' means. Sharpened REFRAME to name specific capabilities Bob now has. Kept strongest line (grocery store metaphor) as anchor.",
