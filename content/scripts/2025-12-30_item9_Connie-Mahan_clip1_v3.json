  "polished_script": "HOOK: The agents who quit didn't fail. They forgot something. [ON-SCREEN: \"They didn't fail. They forgot.\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Connie Mahan went from restaurant manager to REALTOR of the Year in Central Florida. She's watched hundreds of agents burn out and leave the business. [ON-SCREEN: \"Restaurant Manager → REALTOR of the Year\"] You know the feeling — your third failed appraisal this month, the client who ghosted after fifty showings, another deal falling apart at the last minute. [ON-SCREEN: \"Sound familiar?\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what she told me that separates agents who stay from those who quit.\n\nINSIGHT: \"We are so lucky to get to do what we do — help people, honestly and ethically, make the largest decision of their life with as little risk as possible.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"We are SO LUCKY to do what we do\"] She said that with her whole chest. Not as a pitch. As a fact. [ON-SCREEN: \"Help people make their LARGEST decision\"] Because somewhere between contract complications and commission splits, we stopped seeing it. We turned a privilege into a grind. A calling into a checklist.\n\nREFRAME: The burnout isn't from working too hard — it's from forgetting what the work is for. You didn't get licensed to send Zillow alerts. You got licensed to hand someone keys to the house where their kid will take first steps. That's the reset you need.\n\nCTA: \"When's the last time you texted a past client just to ask how they're loving their home?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Restaurant manager → REALTOR of the Year reveals what separates agents who quit vs. those who thrive 🏠✨\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorTips #RealEstateAgent #KeepingItReal #Motivation\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"We turned a privilege into a grind. A calling into a checklist.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Pause after \"They forgot something\" in hook for maximum impact\n2. Say Connie's quote with genuine reverence, slower pace to let it land\n3. Direct eye contact during \"You didn't get licensed to send Zillow alerts\" — make it personal",
