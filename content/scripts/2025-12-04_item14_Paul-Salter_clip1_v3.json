  "polished_script": "HOOK: December will prove if you're actually committed to your goals. [ON-SCREEN: December = The Truth Test]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know that agent who crushed it in October, talked big about Q4 goals, then mysteriously goes quiet after Thanksgiving? [ON-SCREEN: Where do agents go in December?] Maybe you're already mentally checking out, thinking \"I'll restart January first.\" You're telling yourself the market's dead anyway, right? [ON-SCREEN: \"The market's dead anyway...\"]\n\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But mindset coach Paul Salter says December separates the committed from the just interested.\n\nINSIGHT: Here's what Paul told me on the show. Most agents think they're committed, but they're actually just interested. [ON-SCREEN: Committed vs. Interested] Interested agents negotiate with circumstances: \"I'll work hard... unless it's cold, unless it's the holidays, unless my kids are off school.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Unless... unless... unless...\"] But committed agents? Paul says it perfectly: \"If you're committed to your goal, the holidays, the weather, other people's actions leave you absolutely unfazed.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Committed people don't negotiate with circumstances\"] They don't need perfect conditions. They just show up. Even December 23rd.\n\nREFRAME: While everyone else is at holiday parties, committed agents are building January's pipeline. [ON-SCREEN: Building January's Pipeline] You can start today. This is your competitive advantage sitting right in front of you.\n\nCTA: \"Are you committed or just interested? Tell me in the comments.\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: December separates committed agents from interested ones. Which are you? 🎯 Full episode with Paul Salter in bio.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorTips #Mindset #December #Commitment\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Committed people don't negotiate with circumstances.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Emphasize \"December will PROVE\" with strong eye contact on \"prove\"\n2. Slow down on Paul's quote - let it land with gravitas  \n3. Build energy through REFRAME - this should feel like a rallying cry",
