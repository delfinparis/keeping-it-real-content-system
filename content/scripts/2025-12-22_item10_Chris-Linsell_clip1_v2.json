But here's what he's really saying — you don't have to wait for NAR to fix it. Right now, top agents are stitching together their own version. They're buying secondary MLS access in their top three referral markets for $50/month each. They're using Zillow's API to pull comps nationally in under sixty seconds. They're building referral networks where they stay the primary contact, not the handoff guy. Chris dreams of one system. Smart agents are building their own.",
