  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your brain is sabotaging every follow-up call you don't make. [ON-SCREEN: Your brain is sabotaging you]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know you should call your database. You know you need boundaries with demanding clients. You know exactly what to do. But you keep avoiding the same tasks, saying yes when you should say no, and watching opportunities slip away. [ON-SCREEN: You avoid the same tasks over and over]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But performance coach Paul Salter says it's not a discipline problem — it's your wiring.\n\nINSIGHT: Here's what Paul told me: your subconscious mind — that's 90% of your brain — has one job: keep you alive. Not happy, not wealthy, just alive. So when you try to make that follow-up call or set a boundary with a difficult client, your brain reads it as danger and pulls you back to what's safe. [ON-SCREEN: 90% of your brain = survival mode] Paul puts it perfectly: \"You are programmed to survive. You are not programmed to thrive.\" [ON-SCREEN: Programmed to SURVIVE, not THRIVE] That's why you keep avoiding the same calls. It's not you failing — it's your brain doing its job.\n\nREFRAME: Which means you don't need another motivational speech. You need to rewire the pattern. Paul uses memory reconsolidation to help top producers update their brain's threat assessment. One small pattern interrupt can shift everything.\n\nCTA: \"Tomorrow morning, before you check email, call one client you haven't talked to in 90 days. Just to check in. Will you commit to that — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Your brain thinks follow-up calls are dangerous. Performance coach Paul Salter explains why + how to rewire the pattern that's costing you deals.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorTips #RealEstateAgent #Mindset #FollowUp\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You are programmed to survive. You are not programmed to thrive.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver the hook with slight frustration in your voice — like you're calling out the viewer's brain\n2. Slow down on \"90% of your brain\" and the Paul Salter quote — these are the money moments\n3. Lean forward slightly during the CTA to create intimacy and urgency",
