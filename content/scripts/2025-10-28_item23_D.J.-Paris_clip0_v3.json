  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your AI listings sound robotic because you're using one sentence instead of seven. [ON-SCREEN: 1 sentence ≠ good AI]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You copy-paste your listing into ChatGPT, type \"rewrite this,\" hit enter, and get back generic garbage that sounds like every other agent in town. [ON-SCREEN: \"rewrite this\" = garbage] You're frustrated because you know AI can work — you've seen other agents crushing it with their content. \n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what those agents know that you don't.\n\nINSIGHT: A good AI prompt isn't a command — it's a conversation. [ON-SCREEN: Command vs. Conversation] I tell agents: write seven to eight sentences minimum before you hit enter. You're giving it your voice, your target buyer, the home's story, what to emphasize, what to avoid — the exact instructions for a listing description that actually sounds like you. [ON-SCREEN: 7-8 sentences minimum] Most agents skip all of this, then wonder why every listing reads exactly the same. The agents getting incredible results? They're writing prompts longer than the actual listing itself. [ON-SCREEN: Prompt > listing length]\n\nREFRAME: If your AI content feels flat, it's not the tool — it's your input. You're not giving it enough to work with. You can fix this today.\n\nCTA: \"Are you writing seven-sentence prompts, or are you still doing one-liners?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop getting robotic AI listings. The secret is in your prompt length. 7-8 sentences minimum = game changer.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateAI #ListingDescriptions #ChatGPT #RealEstateMarketing #AgentTips\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"A good AI prompt isn't a command — it's a conversation.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Emphasize \"SEVEN\" in the hook with strong eye contact\n2. Slow down on \"conversation\" in the insight for impact\n3. Lean forward slightly during the reframe for intimacy",
