  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your competition just disappeared for six weeks. [ON-SCREEN: Your competition just disappeared]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: It's November. Same story every year. Agents coast into the holidays, slow down their prospecting, stop making calls. You can feel it — your phone's quieter, fewer agents are hustling, everyone's in cruise mode until January. [ON-SCREEN: Agents coast into holidays] You're probably wondering if you should do the same, right? Take a break, enjoy the season, start fresh in the new year.\n  [15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what $300 million producer Carrie McCormick does while everyone else checks out.\n\nINSIGHT: She goes hunting. [ON-SCREEN: Carrie McCormick - $300M Producer] Quote: \"Re-engage with your database, especially during the holidays, when agents typically take their foot off the gas.\" She's calling everyone who bought during the pandemic — their home values are up, rates dropped to 6%, and they're finally not terrified of giving up that 3% mortgage. [ON-SCREEN: 2020-2022 buyers = opportunity] She's texting cash buyers about year-end deals. Most agents do holiday cards. Top producers do holiday prospecting. [ON-SCREEN: Holiday cards vs. holiday prospecting] While they're watching football, she's scheduling January listing appointments.\n\nREFRAME: What you do in Q4 determines your entire 2025. January 1st, you can wake up with ten warm conversations already going, or you can wake up cold like everyone else. [ON-SCREEN: Q4 work = 2025 success]\n\nCTA: \"Open your CRM right now and filter for 2020-2022 closings — are you going to work that list, or let someone else?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: While your competition disappears for 6 weeks, top producers go hunting. Here's Carrie McCormick's $300M strategy.\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #HolidayProspecting #RealtorTips #DatabaseMarketing #Q4Strategy\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Most agents do holiday cards. Top producers do holiday prospecting.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [Emphasize \"disappeared\" in hook with slight pause after. Speed up during brand intro. Lean into \"goes hunting\" with intensity - this is the payoff moment.]",
