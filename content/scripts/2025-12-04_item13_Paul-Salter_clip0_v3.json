  "polished_script": "HOOK: While everyone else posts \"out of office,\" top producers are creating separation. [ON-SCREEN: \"Out of Office\" vs \"Separation Season\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know that feeling in December when deals slow down, clients go quiet, and every agent in your office starts talking about their vacation plans? [ON-SCREEN: \"December = Downtime?\"] You're watching competitors mentally check out while you're wondering if you should too. Mindset coach Paul Salter works with seven-figure producers, and he has a completely different name for December. [ON-SCREEN: \"Paul Salter - Mindset Coach\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: He calls it separation season, and here's why that changes everything.\n\nINSIGHT: According to Paul: \"This separation season is not only an opportunity to distance yourself from your competitors, it's an opportunity to leave the past version of yourself in the dust.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Leave your past self in the dust\"] This isn't just about getting ahead of other agents. It's about lapping who you were last year. [ON-SCREEN: \"5 focused weeks = 3 months advantage\"] Five focused weeks right now is worth three months of playing catch-up in January. That's not motivation talking — that's pure math.\n\nREFRAME: The agent who closes three deals in December isn't just ahead on commission. They're walking into January with momentum while everyone else has to manufacture energy from scratch. [ON-SCREEN: \"Momentum vs Manufacturing\"] You can start this today.\n\nCTA: \"Are you treating December like downtime or separation season?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: December isn't downtime—it's separation season. While competitors check out, you're building an insurmountable lead. 🚀\n\nHASHTAGS: #SeparationSeason #RealEstateSuccess #December2024 #AgentMindset #KeepingItReal\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Five focused weeks right now is worth three months of playing catch-up in January.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Emphasize \"separation\" with a slight pause each time for impact\n2. Speed up delivery during the math section (five weeks = three months) to create urgency  \n3. Lean into camera during the reframe section to create intimacy and conviction",
