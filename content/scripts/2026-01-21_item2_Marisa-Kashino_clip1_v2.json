But they're comparing it to AI-generated kitchen renders they saw on Pinterest this morning. Unlacquered brass. Zellige tile. That specific shade of sage green that's everywhere right now. They're not rejecting the house — they're rejecting the gap between the algorithm's version of 'perfect' and what's actually in front of them. And you know what the worst part is? You're doing the same thing. You spent two hours last night editing your listing photos. Smoothing. Brightening. Making that dated bathroom look 'aspirational.' We're all chasing a standard that doesn't exist.",

Narrowed insight to focus solely on buyer's Pinterest problem with one concrete example (1950s ranch vs. AI renders).
