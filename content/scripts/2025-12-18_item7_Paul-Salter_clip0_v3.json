Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're sitting there thinking it was about commission splits or leads. But mindset coach Paul Salter says it wasn't. It was that moment when they questioned your pricing strategy and you got defensive. Your chest tightened. You interrupted with data to prove you were right. You won the argument. [ON-SCREEN: \"You won the argument\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what that defensive moment actually cost you.\n\nINSIGHT: Paul says that feeling of being attacked isn't weakness — it's something inside asking for attention. [ON-SCREEN: \"Something inside asking for attention\"] Most brokers ignore that chest tightness and bulldoze forward. Top producers use Paul's 90-second regulation technique instead. Notice the tightness. Name it silently — \"I feel threatened.\" Take three breaths. Then ask one question: \"What if they're right?\" [ON-SCREEN: \"What if they're right?\"] That pause between feeling and reacting — that's where you keep your top talent.\n\nREFRAME: You can practice this before your next team meeting. Set a 90-second timer on your phone right now. Run through it once: notice, name, breathe, ask. So when someone challenges your strategy tomorrow, you have a choice instead of just defense.\n\nCTA: \"Are you losing agents because you're winning arguments?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The defensive moment that's costing you top agents (and how to fix it in 90 seconds)\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #Leadership #Mindset #AgentRetention #BrokerTips\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"That pause between feeling and reacting — that's where you keep your top talent.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: 1) Emphasize \"three weeks ago\" with slight disbelief in voice 2) Slow down on the four-step technique for clarity 3) Direct eye contact on final CTA question",
