  "polished_script": "HOOK: A $40 million producer just confessed she's terrible at the one thing every agent avoids. [ON-SCREEN: $40M Producer's CRM Confession]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Bari Mill closes $40 million annually in Chicago real estate. But she admits she's absolutely terrible at updating her CRM. Sound familiar? You know that sinking feeling when you realize you haven't touched your database in weeks, and now you're staring at a mountain of contacts with zero notes. [ON-SCREEN: You haven't updated your CRM in weeks...]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's the dead-simple system she uses to stay on top of it.\n\nINSIGHT: Bari's solution? Ten minutes. That's it. She sets a daily timer and said, \"CRM is something that is not that hard, and if I just set an alarm or timer to input clients for 10 minutes a day, it's not that hard.\" [ON-SCREEN: 10 minutes daily vs 3 hours of panic] Not an hour-long Sunday session where you hate your life. Not a quarterly database cleanup. A simple timer, every single day. She treats it like brushing her teeth — boring, non-negotiable, done before she can talk herself out of it. [ON-SCREEN: Boring + Non-negotiable = Done]\n\nREFRAME: Because agents who close $40 million aren't superhuman. They just refuse to let boring tasks pile up into a crisis. Ten minutes today beats three hours of panic updating next month.\n\nCTA: \"Are you going to set that 10-minute timer today — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: $40M producer's 10-minute CRM hack that beats 3-hour panic sessions ⏰ #RealEstate\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #CRM #RealtorTips #ProductivityHacks #RealEstateAgent\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Ten minutes today beats three hours of panic next month.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Emphasize \"$40 million\" with slight pause after for impact\n2. Speed up during the timer explanation to match the urgency of the tactic\n3. Direct eye contact on the final CTA question — make it feel personal",
