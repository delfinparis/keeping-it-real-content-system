Buyer asks why it's priced there. Weak agent says: 'Market analysis supports it.' Carrie says: 'Two comps closed 90 days ago at $1.95M. Since then, inventory dropped 40% in this zip code. We priced at $2.1M because we're launching with a 72-hour social blitz, broker event Tuesday, and if we don't get action in 10 days, we adjust. Here's the timeline.' One agent gave a number. One gave certainty. Guess who got the listing.",
