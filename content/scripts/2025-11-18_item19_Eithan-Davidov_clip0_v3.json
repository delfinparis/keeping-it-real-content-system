  "polished_script": "HOOK: A guy closing 100 deals a year just told me what he hates most about his job. [ON-SCREEN: 100 DEALS/YEAR]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know that sick feeling when you see your CRM full of contacts you should've followed up with weeks ago? The guilt when a hot lead goes cold because you didn't make that third call? [ON-SCREEN: YOUR CRM RIGHT NOW] You tell yourself you'll get to it tomorrow, but tomorrow never comes, and your pipeline stays empty.\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: Well, Eithan Davidov just revealed the brutal truth about what separates closers from everyone else.\n\nINSIGHT: Eithan runs one of the top teams in Queens — investment sales, residential, the whole game. [ON-SCREEN: EITHAN DAVIDOV] When I asked what separates closers from everyone else, he didn't say prospecting or negotiation. He said: \"The fortune is in the follow-up. And as much as I wish it wasn't, it's the hardest part.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"THE FORTUNE IS IN THE FOLLOW-UP\"] Not the first call. Not the listing presentation. The third text. The fifth email. The call three months later when they're finally ready. [ON-SCREEN: 3RD TEXT, 5TH EMAIL] That's where deals live or die. And here's the thing — he HATES it too, but does it anyway.\n\nREFRAME: If you're avoiding follow-up, you're not broken — you're normal. The difference is top producers built systems so it happens whether they feel like it or not. You can start this today.\n\nCTA: \"Open your CRM right now and tell me — how many people should you have followed up with last month?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The brutal truth about follow-up from an agent closing 100 deals/year 📈 (He hates it too but does it anyway)\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #FollowUp #CRM #RealEstateAgent #KeepingItReal\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"The fortune is in the follow-up. And as much as I wish it wasn't, it's the hardest part.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Deliver hook with genuine surprise/intrigue [2] Slow down on the quote \"The fortune is in the follow-up\" — let it land [3] Direct eye contact on CTA question — make it feel personal",
