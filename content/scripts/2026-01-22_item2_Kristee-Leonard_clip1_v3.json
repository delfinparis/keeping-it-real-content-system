  "polished_script": "HOOK: The $50 million agents never complain about difficult clients. [ON-SCREEN: $50M agents have no \"difficult\" clients]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know that feeling when a client texts you at 9 PM, or wants to see the same house three times, and you're internally rolling your eyes thinking \"here we go again\"? Most agents see client demands as interruptions to their day. [ON-SCREEN: Client texts at 9 PM = interruption?]\n\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But Kristee Leonard, who moves over $50 million in Austin luxury real estate annually, sees it completely differently.\n\nINSIGHT: When I asked Kristee about client management, she said something that stopped me cold: \"It's an honor to be chosen by clients, and I treat them like they're an honor.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"I treat them like they're an honor\"] Not tolerate. Not manage. Honor. That 9 PM text? That's someone who trusted her with their biggest financial decision. Three showings? That's someone making sure they get it right. [ON-SCREEN: Reframe = everything changes]\n\nREFRAME: Here's what happens when you make this shift: You stop resenting the work, you stop complaining about clients, and they absolutely feel that energy. That energy difference is what separates a one-time transaction from a referral machine that builds a $50 million business.\n\nCTA: \"So be honest — do your clients feel honored to work with you, or do they feel like they're bothering you?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The mindset shift that separates $50M agents from everyone else 🏠✨ #RealEstate #ClientService\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorTips #ClientService #LuxuryRealEstate #RealtorMindset\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"It's an honor to be chosen by clients, and I treat them like they're an honor.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver the hook with conviction — pause after \"never complain\" for emphasis\n2. Slow down and soften tone when delivering Kristee's actual quote — let it land\n3. Lean forward slightly during the reframe section to create intimacy and urgency",
