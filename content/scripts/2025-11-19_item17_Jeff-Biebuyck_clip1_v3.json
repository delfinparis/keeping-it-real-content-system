  "polished_script": "HOOK: A top 1% luxury agent just said Zillow saved his team. [ON-SCREEN: \"ZILLOW SAVED MY TEAM\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Jeff Biebuyck sells luxury homes in Calabasas and Hidden Hills — we're talking multimillion-dollar properties. When his hyper-local market got squeezed, he watched other top agents do what most do: dig in deeper, fight harder for the same shrinking pool of deals. [ON-SCREEN: \"MARKET SQUEEZED = FIGHT HARDER?\"] You know this feeling — when your area gets competitive, your first instinct is to double down, right? \n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But Jeff did the exact opposite, and it saved his business.\n\nINSIGHT: Instead of fighting for scraps in one zip code, Jeff used Zillow Flex as a geographic expansion strategy. Not for leads — for territory. [ON-SCREEN: \"ZILLOW FLEX = EXPANSION TOOL\"] His exact words: \"Zillow honestly kind of helps save our team... we were able to diversify spread out across all of greater Los Angeles.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"DIVERSIFY ACROSS GREATER LA\"] While other luxury agents waited for their micro-market to recover, Jeff's team was closing deals in six different areas. Most agents defend one territory. Top producers build multiple territories.\n\nREFRAME: This isn't about Zillow — it's about thinking like a business owner instead of a territorial agent. Your market doesn't owe you deals. When your area contracts, you can either shrink with it or expand beyond it.\n\nCTA: \"Are you defending territory or building a business?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Top 1% luxury agent reveals how Zillow saved his team when his market got squeezed 📈\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #ZillowFlex #LuxuryRealEstate #RealEstateAgent #BusinessStrategy\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Your market doesn't owe you deals.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Hit \"ZILLOW SAVED HIS TEAM\" with genuine surprise in your voice — this should sound counterintuitive\n2. Slow down on Jeff's direct quote (0:32-0:38) — let his words land with authority\n3. Lean into camera on the reframe at 0:45 — this is the \"lightbulb moment\" for viewers",
