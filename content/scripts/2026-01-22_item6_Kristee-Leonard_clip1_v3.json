  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your smallest listing is destroying your biggest opportunities. [ON-SCREEN: Your smallest listing is destroying your biggest opportunities]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You say you treat every client the same. But that $250K listing gets basic photos while your $2M property gets the full staging treatment. Your response time? Twenty minutes for luxury, two hours for starter homes. [ON-SCREEN: $250K listing = basic photos, $2M listing = full staging] Kristee Leonard built a $50M business in Austin luxury, and she says this double standard is the silent career killer most agents never see coming. [ON-SCREEN: Kristee Leonard - $50M+ in sales]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's the part that'll change how you think about every listing.\n\nINSIGHT: Here's exactly what Kristee told me: \"If you choose to take on that client, then you need to represent them just like if they were a multimillion dollar deal.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Represent them like a multimillion dollar deal\"] Not try to. Not when you can. Need to. Because that $250K seller? Her sister is shopping $3M properties. That first-time buyer's boss just got promoted and needs to relocate. [ON-SCREEN: Your $250K seller's sister = $3M buyer] They're watching everything — your response time at 8 PM, whether you spring for professional photos, if you show up the same way. Most agents have two standards. Top producers have one.\n\nREFRAME: This isn't about being nice — it's about understanding that your reputation isn't built on your biggest deal. It's built on your most inconsistent one. The client you half-repped is the one telling the story at the dinner party.\n\nCTA: \"Pull your last five clients right now — if someone looked at your effort level, would they see one standard or two?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The client you're half-repping is the one destroying your reputation at dinner parties. One standard or two? 🤔\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateAgent #ListingAgent #RealEstateTips #AgentMindset #RealEstateSuccess\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Your reputation isn't built on your biggest deal — it's built on your most inconsistent one.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver hook with slight pause after \"smallest listing\" for emphasis\n2. Speed up during brand intro, then slow down for emotional weight on \"silent career killer\"\n3. Lean forward slightly during the Kristee quote to create intimacy, then pull back for the reframe",
