Buyer's agent said 'we're pre-approved, let's write.' Jeff didn't verify. Deal died 48 hours before close. Now? Jeff has a 24-hour rule: no offer gets written until HE talks to the lender. Every single time. He's killed three deals in the last year before they wasted anyone's time — and closed 14 others because sellers trust him to vet harder than anyone else.
