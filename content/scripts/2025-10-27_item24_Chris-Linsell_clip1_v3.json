  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your brokerage logo has never closed a single deal. [ON-SCREEN: YOUR LOGO ≠ YOUR SUCCESS]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Chris Linsell—real estate tech strategist—just dropped a truth bomb about the Compass-Anywhere merger that's making agents uncomfortable. You're probably sitting there thinking your brokerage brand gives you credibility, that clients pick up the phone because of that logo on your business card. [ON-SCREEN: DOES YOUR BROKERAGE SELL YOU?]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Chris said that changes everything.\n\nINSIGHT: \"Your clients do not care what brokerage you're a part of. They remember who you are.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"CLIENTS REMEMBER WHO YOU ARE\"] Think about your last five closings—did any client choose you because of your broker? Or because you answered at 9 PM, knew their neighborhood inside out, and showed up fifteen minutes early? [ON-SCREEN: YOU BUILT THAT TRUST] The brokerage didn't earn that referral. You did. Most agents think they're borrowing credibility from their company. Top producers know they ARE the brand.\n\nREFRAME: So here's your stress test: if your brokerage got acquired tomorrow, would you still have a business? The agents surviving industry chaos aren't the ones with the fanciest logos—they're the ones clients remember by name.\n\nCTA: \"How many of your clients would follow you if you switched brokerages today?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Your brokerage logo isn't your brand. You are. Here's how to build real client loyalty that follows you anywhere. 💪\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #PersonalBrand #ClientLoyalty #RealEstateAgent #AgentTips\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Your clients do not care what brokerage you're a part of. They remember who you are.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: 1) Deliver the hook with conviction—pause after \"single deal\" for impact 2) Speed up during brand intro, then slow down for the Chris Linsell quote for emphasis 3) Maintain direct eye contact during the final CTA question—make it feel personal",
