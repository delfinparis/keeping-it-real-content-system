  "polished_script": "HOOK: You're invisible on Google while agents with half your experience steal your listings. [ON-SCREEN: \"INVISIBLE ON GOOGLE\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: TV producer turned agent coach Kim Ritberg sees this pattern everywhere: experienced agents losing deals to newer agents who simply show up better online. You've got the credentials, the track record, the expertise. But when sellers Google you, they find a basic bio while your competition has something much more powerful. [ON-SCREEN: \"CREDENTIALS ≠ CONNECTIONS\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: And Kim says there's one video that changes everything — but 90% of agents never make it.\n\nINSIGHT: It's your About Me video. Not another listing tour or market update. The video that answers one question: \"What makes you different than the agent around the corner?\" Kim says a resume lists credentials, but an About Me video shows personality, shows proof, shows why YOU are the call they should make. [ON-SCREEN: \"BIO = FACTS, VIDEO = FEELING\"] When a seller researches three agents and two have bios but one has a video — guess who gets the call? In 2026, you're either on video or you're invisible.\n\nREFRAME: Here's what shifts everything: Before your listing appointment, they've already heard your voice and decided they like you. You walk in warm, not cold. You're not pitching yourself anymore — you're confirming what they already believe. [ON-SCREEN: \"WARM APPOINTMENTS > COLD PITCHES\"]\n\nCTA: \"Do you have an About Me video on your Google results — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The one video that turns Google searches into warm listing appointments (most agents skip this)\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #VideoMarketing #ListingAgent #RealEstateMarketing #AgentTips\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"In 2026, you're either on video or you're invisible.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Emphasize \"invisible\" and \"half your experience\" in hook with slight pause. [2] Speed up during brand intro, then slow down for mirror moment in setup. [3] Direct eye contact on final question — make it feel personal.",
