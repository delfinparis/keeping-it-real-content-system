  "polished_script": "HOOK: Gen Z is making 50% more income than boomers were at their age — and you're still not calling them back. [ON-SCREEN: Gen Z earns 50% MORE than boomers at same age]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Amanda Pendleton from Zillow studied the actual data on Gen Z buyers, and what she found should completely change who you're prospecting this week. [ON-SCREEN: Amanda Pendleton - Zillow] You're probably thinking Gen Z can't afford homes, they're broke, they're not serious buyers. You send them market reports they don't read and wonder why they ghost you after one showing. [ON-SCREEN: \"They're not serious buyers...\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what's actually happening that most agents completely miss.\n\nINSIGHT: Gen Z isn't broke — they're earning more than any previous generation at their age. But they're researching on TikTok at 11pm, watching neighborhood tours on YouTube during lunch, and asking ChatGPT about mortgage rates. [ON-SCREEN: TikTok • YouTube • ChatGPT] They don't need another email blast. They need an agent who answers DMs in under an hour and explains down payment assistance like they're texting a friend. [ON-SCREEN: Answer DMs < 1 hour] The average first-time buyer is now 36, and every year they wait costs them thirty thousand in equity. [ON-SCREEN: Average 1st-time buyer: 36 years old]\n\nREFRAME: This isn't about learning TikTok dances — it's about meeting buyers where they already are. Gen Z closed 30% more purchases last year, they're just working with the three agents in your market who actually respond fast and speak their language. [ON-SCREEN: Gen Z purchases ↑ 30%]\n\nCTA: \"Are you ready to test this — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Gen Z buyers are earning 50% more than boomers at their age but researching homes completely differently. Are you adapting? 🏠📱\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #GenZ #RealEstateAgent #HomeB buyers #RealEstateTips\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"They don't need another email blast — they need an agent who answers DMs in under an hour and explains down payment assistance like they're texting a friend.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver hook with slight disbelief/surprise in voice to emphasize the irony\n2. Slow down and emphasize \"thirty thousand in equity\" for maximum impact\n3. Lean forward slightly during the CTA question to create intimacy and urgency",

    "original_score": 5,
    "judge_note": "The insight is too generic ('cut through the noise') — give one specific tactic for reaching Gen Z buyers, like 'post neighborhood walkthroughs on TikTok' or 'answer DMs within 10 minutes, not 10 hours.'",
