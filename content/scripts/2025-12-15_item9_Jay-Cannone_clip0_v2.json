Told them exactly what happened and exactly what I'd do next. No spin. No excuses.' Then he looked at me and said: 'Show up. Do the work. Be straight. Do that long enough, and success becomes inevitable.' Here's what he means by inevitable: the market runs out of ways to say no to you. Not because you're the smartest. Because you're the one who keeps showing up when it's uncomfortable.",
      "production_note": "Jay speaking directly to camera for the kitchen table story. Cut to B-roll of agent driving at dusk, knocking on door, sitting across table (reenactment style). Text overlay: 'SHOW UP. DO THE WORK. BE STRAIGHT.' Then return to Jay for final line."

      "production_note": "Return to Jay looking directly at camera. Text overlay appears step-by-step: '1. OPEN YOUR PHONE' → '2. FIND THE CONVERSATION' → '3. TEXT THEM NOW' → 'SEND IT.' Fade to podcast logo."
