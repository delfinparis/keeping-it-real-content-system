  "polished_script": "HOOK: You have 300 listing photos rotting in your camera roll doing nothing. [ON-SCREEN: 300 photos = 0 engagement]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Meanwhile, agents half as experienced are getting ten times your social media engagement because they cracked one code: static photos are invisible online. You post your gorgeous $2M listing, get 47 measly views, and wonder why nobody cares. [ON-SCREEN: Your listings: 47 views vs Their content: 4,700 views]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Courtney Poulos in LA just showed me that changes everything.\n\nINSIGHT: She takes those same listing photos already sitting on her phone and runs them through AI that transforms them into scroll-stopping video content. No filming required. No editing skills needed. As she told me, \"It brings it to life.\" [ON-SCREEN: 90 seconds to upload, 2 minutes to render] Here's what that actually means: Your listing that got 47 impressions as a static photo becomes a cinematic walkthrough getting shared by buyers you've never even met. The AI adds motion, transitions, background music. Takes her 90 seconds to upload, two minutes to render. Done. [ON-SCREEN: Static photo → Viral video]\n\nREFRAME: You're not behind on content because you can't film. You're behind because you haven't automated what you already own. Every closed listing is fifty pieces of content sitting in your camera roll right now.\n\nCTA: \"Are you going to try this with your next five listing photos — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Turn your dead listing photos into viral video content in 90 seconds (no filming required) 🎬📱\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateMarketing #ListingPhotos #AIVideo #RealEstateTips #SocialMediaStrategy\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Every closed listing is fifty pieces of content sitting in your camera roll right now.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1) Emphasize \"300 photos rotting\" with slight disgust in voice, [2) Slow down on the 90 seconds/2 minutes timing for impact, [3) Look directly into camera during the reframe section for maximum connection]",
