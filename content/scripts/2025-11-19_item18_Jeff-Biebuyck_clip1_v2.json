Then they get the insurance quote — if they can even GET insurance — and the numbers don't work anymore. In fire-risk zones, premiums doubled or tripled. In flood zones, policies disappeared entirely. Suddenly a $2 million home costs $25K a year just to insure. That's a $2,000 monthly payment your buyer didn't budget for.",
