  "polished_script": "HOOK: The agents closing $40 million don't chase everyone. They do the opposite. [ON-SCREEN: $40M producers do THIS]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're probably sending postcards to entire zip codes, messaging every Facebook friend, and wondering why your phone isn't ringing. You feel like you're everywhere but nobody's choosing you. [ON-SCREEN: Chasing everyone = chosen by no one] Meanwhile, agents like Bari Mill went from teacher to top Chicago producer in just six years. \n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what she did that most agents never even think to try.\n\nINSIGHT: Bari picked one target: finance professionals in Chicago. Not everyone. Just finance people. Then she joined the Chicago Finance Professionals networking group and showed up every single month. [ON-SCREEN: 1 niche + 1 group + consistent showing up] She didn't pitch. She just listened. After three months, one guy asked if she knew real estate. She helped him buy a condo. He introduced her to four colleagues. [ON-SCREEN: 1 client → 4 referrals] Within a year, she became THE agent for that entire world. When finance people need real estate, they think of Bari. Not because she's everywhere, but because she's the ONLY agent they see in their world.\n\nREFRAME: You don't need a thousand leads. You need twenty people who trust you in ONE world. One group, one monthly meetup, one conversation that turns into four referrals. That's the difference between chasing and being chosen.\n\nCTA: \"Are you going to pick your niche this week — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop chasing everyone. Pick ONE niche and become THE agent for that world. Here's exactly how Bari Mill did it 👆\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateNiche #NetworkingTips #RealEstateSuccess #AgentTips #KeepingItReal\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You don't need a thousand leads. You need twenty people who trust you in ONE world.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Emphasize \"opposite\" in hook with slight pause before it\n2. Slow down on the four key numbers: $40M, six years, three months, four colleagues  \n3. Lean into camera on \"THE agent\" to create intimacy and authority",
