  "polished_script": "HOOK: I sold my condo in two days using one AI prompt. [ON-SCREEN: SOLD IN 2 DAYS]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're still writing listing descriptions the same way you did five years ago. Copy-pasting \"spacious kitchen\" and \"abundant natural light\" while your listings sit for weeks. [ON-SCREEN: SAME OLD DESCRIPTIONS] I just proved there's a better way when I sold my own condo.\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's the part that'll shock you about what happened next.\n\nINSIGHT: I fed my property details into ChatGPT with one specific prompt. Thirty seconds later, I had copy that wasn't just better — it was emotionally resonant. [ON-SCREEN: 30 SECONDS = BETTER COPY] Instead of describing features, it painted a lifestyle. Instead of listing rooms, it sold dreams. The result? Two days. Not two weeks — two days. [ON-SCREEN: 2 DAYS vs 2 WEEKS] Most agents write descriptions. Top producers write emotions.\n\nREFRAME: Here's what this means: every extra day your listing sits is another day buyers question the price. [ON-SCREEN: EXTRA DAYS = BUYER DOUBT] You can literally do this today — take your weakest listing and prompt AI with \"write this like you're selling a dream, not a house.\"\n\nCTA: \"Are you ready to try this on your next listing — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: One AI prompt sold my condo in 2 days. Here's exactly what I did 👇\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #AITools #ListingTips #RealEstateAgent #PropertyMarketing\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Most agents write descriptions. Top producers write emotions.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Emphasize \"TWO DAYS\" with conviction and slight pause before/after\n2. Speed up during the 30-second AI process explanation to show how fast it works  \n3. Direct eye contact on the final CTA question — lean slightly forward for engagement",
