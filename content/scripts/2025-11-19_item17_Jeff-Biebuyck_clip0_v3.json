  "polished_script": "HOOK: A $2.1 million deal vanished because he ignored advice he'd heard a hundred times. [ON-SCREEN: $2.1 MILLION LOST]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You've been told to follow up fast, nurture your database, price strategically. You nod, you agree, you keep doing exactly what you've always done. [ON-SCREEN: YOU'VE HEARD IT ALL BEFORE] Jeff Biebuyck has sold hundreds of millions in luxury real estate, been to every mastermind, hired the best coaches. \n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what he told me about the only advice that actually changes your behavior.\n\nINSIGHT: \"The best advice I've gotten is from the mistakes I've learned, because otherwise it wouldn't have been good advice to myself.\" [ON-SCREEN: MISTAKES = BEST ADVICE] Here's what happened: His mentor told him for years to follow up within 24 hours. He nodded every time. Then he waited three days to call back a hot lead. [ON-SCREEN: 3 DAYS TOO LATE] Someone else swooped in. $2.1 million gone. That's when the advice became real — not when he heard it, but when it cost him.\n\nREFRAME: If you fumbled a deal this year — overpriced and watched it sit, didn't call back fast enough, let a buyer ghost you — that's not failure. That's tuition for the only kind of advice that actually rewrites your behavior. [ON-SCREEN: FAILURE = TUITION]\n\nCTA: \"What's the one deal you lost this year that still stings?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The $2.1M mistake that taught him more than any mentor ever could 💸 What \"tuition\" are you paying right now?\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #RealtorTips #LuxuryRealEstate #RealEstateAgent #RealEstateMistakes\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"That's not failure. That's tuition for the only kind of advice that actually rewrites your behavior.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Hit \"$2.1 million\" with emphasis and pause after for impact\n2. Speed up during brand intro, then slow down for the re-hook line\n3. Direct eye contact on \"That's not failure. That's tuition\" - this is the screenshot moment",
