  "polished_script": "HOOK: You're not bad at video. You just started in the wrong place. [ON-SCREEN: \"You're not bad at video\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Most agents buy ring lights and learn editing apps first. Then they wonder why they still freeze on camera every single time. Kim Rittberg — six-time Emmy Award-winning marketer who led video strategy at Netflix — says you're skipping the most important step. [ON-SCREEN: \"6x Emmy Winner • Netflix Video Strategy\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: And this is the part that separates agents who succeed with video from those who quit after three attempts.\n\nINSIGHT: She calls it MSR: Mindset, Skill set, Repetition. Most agents skip straight to skill set. [ON-SCREEN: \"MSR: Mindset → Skill Set → Repetition\"] They think \"I'll feel confident once I'm good at it.\" Kim says that's completely backwards: \"You need to have a mindset shift before you can truly grow with video.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Mindset shift comes FIRST\"] The identity shift happens first — you decide you ARE someone who does video. Then you learn the technical skills. Then you repeat until it becomes automatic. Not the other way around.\n\nREFRAME: Think about it — you didn't wait to feel like a real estate expert before your first listing appointment. You decided you were an agent, then figured it out as you went. Video works exactly the same way.\n\nCTA: \"So here's your homework: record one practice video today where you introduce yourself as 'someone who does video.' Don't post it — just say it out loud. Are you going to try this today?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Netflix's video strategy leader reveals why most agents fail at video (it's not what you think) 🎥\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateVideo #AgentTips #VideoMarketing #RealEstateMarketing #AgentMindset\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You need to have a mindset shift before you can truly grow with video.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: [1] Pause after \"wrong place\" in hook for impact [2] Emphasize \"completely backwards\" with slight head shake [3] Direct eye contact during the homework assignment in CTA",
