  "polished_script": "**HOOK:** A $4.2 million listing died because of two words: \"We're pre-approved.\" [ON-SCREEN: $4.2M LISTING LOST]\n\n**BRAND INTRO:** \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\n**SETUP:** Jeff Biebuyck is top 1% in Calabasas luxury — celebrities, executives, massive deals. [ON-SCREEN: TOP 1% LUXURY AGENT] But that $4.2 million listing? Buyer's agent said \"we're pre-approved, let's write.\" Jeff trusted it. The deal died 48 hours before close. [ON-SCREEN: DEAL DIED 48 HRS BEFORE CLOSE] You know that sick feeling when a deal implodes? When you realize you could've prevented it but didn't ask the right questions?\n\n**[15-SEC RE-HOOK]:** Here's how Jeff turned that disaster into his competitive advantage.\n\n**INSIGHT:** Jeff told me: \"Honestly, I think the best advice I've gotten is from the mistakes I've learned.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"BEST ADVICE COMES FROM MISTAKES\"] Now he has a 24-hour rule: no offer gets written until HE personally talks to the lender. Every single time. [ON-SCREEN: 24-HOUR RULE - TALK TO LENDER] He's killed three deals in the last year before they wasted anyone's time — and closed 14 others because sellers trust him to vet harder than anyone else. [ON-SCREEN: KILLED 3 DEALS, CLOSED 14] Every mistake became a system. Every failure became a filter.\n\n**REFRAME:** If deals are blowing up on you, that's not failure — that's intelligence. You now know exactly where your process needs bulletproofing. You can fix this today.\n\n**CTA:** \"What's the one deal you lost that still keeps you up at night?\"\n\n**CLOSE:** \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\n**CAPTION:** One $4.2M mistake taught this luxury agent how to close deals others can't even pitch. Here's his system. 🏠💰\n\n**HASHTAGS:** #RealEstate #RealEstateAgent #LuxuryRealEstate #RealEstateTips #RealtorLife\n\n**SHAREABLE_MOMENT:** \"Every mistake became a system. Every failure became a filter.\"\n\n**PERFORMANCE_NOTES:** \n1. Pause dramatically after \"We're pre-approved\" in the hook — let the tension build\n2. Speed up during brand intro, then slow down for emotional weight on \"sick feeling\" \n3. Emphasize \"HE personally\" with strong eye contact — make it about taking control",
