I'm excited.\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Courtney Poulos has crushed LA real estate for 15 years. Runs one of the city's most respected boutique brokerages. Featured by LA Business Journal. But she still gets nervous about new platforms. Sound familiar? You've got the expertise, the track record, the clients who trust you — but that one marketing channel everyone's talking about? You keep putting it off because what if you mess up? What if you look amateur? [ON-SCREEN: 15 years crushing LA real estate] \n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what she said that changes everything.\n\nINSIGHT: Right before we went live, Courtney said: \"I do the most. This is my first YouTube live. I'm excited.\" No pretending she's done it a thousand times. No fake confidence. Just real energy and honest excitement about trying something new. [ON-SCREEN: \"I do the most. This is my first YouTube live.\"] Most agents think clients want perfection. Top producers know clients want someone who shows up, adapts, and tries the thing everyone else is too scared to attempt. [ON-SCREEN: Clients don't want perfection — they want someone who SHOWS UP]\n\nREFRAME: You don't need to be the most tech-savvy agent in your market. You just need to be willing to look like a beginner in front of people. That willingness to be imperfect? That's your actual competitive advantage in 2024.\n\nCTA: \"What's the one platform you've been avoiding because you're scared you'll look stupid?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: 15-year LA veteran still gets nervous about new platforms. Here's why that's actually her superpower 🔥\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateAgent #AgentTips #RealEstateTips #LARealestate #KeepingItReal\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"You don't need to be the most tech-savvy agent in your market. You just need to be willing to look like a beginner in front of people.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Deliver the hook quote with Courtney's exact energy — excited but slightly nervous\n2. Emphasize \"SHOWS UP\" strongly in the insight section — this is the key differentiator  \n3. Lean into camera during the reframe about competitive advantage — make it feel like insider knowledge",
