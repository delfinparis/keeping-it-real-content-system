  "polished_script": "HOOK: Most agents lose to developers because of one lazy habit. [ON-SCREEN: \"Why agents lose to developers\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You've been pitching developers the same way everyone else does—polished email, your stats deck, maybe a slick presentation. You send it off and... crickets. Meanwhile, some other agent with half your experience just landed the listing you wanted. [ON-SCREEN: \"Your pitch gets ignored\"]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: Here's what that agent did that you didn't.\n\nINSIGHT: Jill Preschel—who's done over two billion in luxury New York development deals—says forget the deck. [ON-SCREEN: \"$2B+ in transactions\"] Her advice: \"Show up at the development, walk the home, take it in, be there.\" Physical presence beats digital pitches every time. [ON-SCREEN: \"Show up in person\"] Because developers don't hire agents who can talk about the building—they hire agents who know the building. The sight lines. The finishes. The story only comes from standing inside the space. [ON-SCREEN: \"Know the building inside out\"]\n\nREFRAME: This isn't schmoozing—it's competence. When you show up before you're hired, you're already doing the job. And that separates agents who get listings from ones still waiting for callbacks.\n\nCTA: \"Pick one development in your market and walk it this week—what's stopping you?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The $2B agent's secret to landing developer listings (it's not what you think)\n\nHASHTAGS: #realestate #newdevelopment #luxuryrealestate #realestateagent #listings\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Developers don't hire agents who can talk about the building—they hire agents who know the building.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Pause after \"crickets\" in SETUP for emphasis on the frustration\n2. Say Jill's quote slowly and clearly—it's the money line\n3. Build energy through INSIGHT, then drop to conversational tone for REFRAME",
