When Zillow transfers a lead, she doesn't introduce herself first — she asks when they want to see the house. Because they already chose her. That choice? That's the whole game. Most agents forget this after year three. They start seeing clients as interruptions. Kristee sees them as the reason she still gets to do this work.",
