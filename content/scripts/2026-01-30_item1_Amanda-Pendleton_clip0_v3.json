  "polished_script": "HOOK: A ten-dollar duvet could be worth thirty thousand in commission. [ON-SCREEN: $10 duvet = $30K commission]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You're prepping a listing for photos. Kitchen's staged, clutter's gone, but something still feels off about those bedroom shots. Your listings are getting views but not engagement. Buyers scroll right past. [ON-SCREEN: Listings getting views but no engagement]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Amanda Pendleton from Zillow discovered analyzing millions of listings.\n\nINSIGHT: White linens get thirty percent more engagement than any other bedding. Not better homes. Just whiter sheets. [ON-SCREEN: White linens = 30% more engagement] Amanda told us: \"If I have an agent and I'm doing photos for a listing, I would probably keep a white duvet in my trunk.\" Ten bucks at Target. Five minutes before the photographer arrives. Walk through, swap out that floral comforter for crisp white. [ON-SCREEN: $10 at Target, 5 minutes before photos] The bedroom instantly looks bigger, cleaner, more aspirational. Buyers scroll slower, click save, book showings.\n\nREFRAME: You're already staging counters and hiding family photos. This is the same principle, except ninety-nine percent of agents aren't doing it yet. Which means you get the competitive advantage right now.\n\nCTA: \"Will you buy two white duvets this week and test this on your next listing?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: One Zillow data scientist's $10 trick that increases listing engagement by 30%. Most agents have no idea this works.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #ListingTips #RealEstateMarketing #PropertyPhotography #ZillowTips\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"White linens get thirty percent more engagement than any other bedding. Not better homes. Just whiter sheets.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Hit \"thirty thousand in commission\" with emphasis and pause after for impact\n2. Speed up during the Amanda quote to show tactical urgency \n3. Lean forward slightly during the reframe to create intimacy around the \"competitive advantage\"",
