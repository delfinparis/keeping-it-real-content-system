  "polished_script": "HOOK: You're getting better at the wrong thing. [ON-SCREEN: Getting better at the WRONG thing]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: Every sales training tells you the same thing: perfect your pitch, master objection handling, learn closing techniques. You practice your listing presentation until it's flawless. You rehearse every possible buyer question. But you're still losing deals to agents who seem less polished than you. [ON-SCREEN: Still losing deals?]\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: And this is where Courtney Poulos — recognized leader by LA Business Journal — says most agents get it completely backwards.\n\nINSIGHT: Here's what she told me: \"The art of sales is not in my ability to sell. It's in the clients' ability or desire to trust me.\" [ON-SCREEN: \"Trust me\" not \"sell me\"] Think about it. The mechanic you never question. The doctor whose advice you follow without hesitation. The hairstylist you've been seeing for ten years. They're not better salespeople — they're more trusted people. [ON-SCREEN: More trusted = More sales] You're not losing deals because your pitch is weak. You're losing deals because trust was never built in the first place.\n\nREFRAME: So what if you stopped trying to get better at convincing people and started getting better at being the kind of person people don't need to be convinced by? That changes everything — how you market, how you communicate, how you spend your time.\n\nCTA: \"Pull out your last three lost deals and be honest: was it your pitch that failed or was trust never built in the first place?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: The mechanic you never question isn't a better salesperson — they're a more trusted person. Same with top-producing agents.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #SalesTips #TrustBuilding #RealtorTips #KeepingItReal\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"The art of sales is not in my ability to sell. It's in the clients' ability or desire to trust me.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Pause after \"wrong thing\" in hook for maximum impact\n2. Slow down and emphasize \"trust was never built\" — this is the key revelation\n3. Lean forward slightly during the reframe question to create intimacy and urgency",
