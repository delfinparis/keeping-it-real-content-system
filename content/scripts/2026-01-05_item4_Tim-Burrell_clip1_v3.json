  "polished_script": "HOOK: Your deal is dying and you have no idea it's happening. [ON-SCREEN: \"Your deal is dying\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You know that sick feeling when a deal falls apart and you're blindsided? When your buyer or seller suddenly goes nuclear and you're thinking \"where did that come from?\" Tim Burrell, a top producer in Raleigh, used to lose deals this exact way. [ON-SCREEN: \"Tim Burrell - Top Producer\"] The worst part? The warning signs were there the whole time in their emails. But here's what he discovered that changes everything.\n\n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: He found a way to read their minds before they even know they're angry.\n\nINSIGHT: Tim runs every single negotiation email through ChatGPT with a custom prompt that flags tone shifts before they explode. [ON-SCREEN: \"Custom ChatGPT Prompt\"] He told me: \"AI can flag changes in tone and make the change in attitude and flag that these people are getting mad.\" It's like having a negotiation radar. [ON-SCREEN: \"AI Negotiation Radar\"] His prompt rates every email thread on a frustration scale of 1 to 10, and anything above a 6 gets flagged immediately. Most agents miss email number one when the tone shifts. Top producers catch it before they hit send on the reply that kills the deal.\n\nREFRAME: Think about your last deal that imploded. I guarantee there were three emails that week where the frustration was building and you missed every single warning sign. You can literally do this tonight with your current deals.\n\nCTA: \"Do you have a deal right now where the tone feels off — yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: AI can save your deals by catching angry clients before they explode 🚨 This prompt changed everything for top producer Tim Burrell\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstate #AIForRealtors #Negotiation #RealtorTips #RealEstateAgent\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Most agents miss email number one when the tone shifts. Top producers catch it before they hit send on the reply that kills the deal.\"\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: 1) Deliver hook with urgency and concern in voice 2) Emphasize \"before they even know they're angry\" with slight pause after \"minds\" 3) Lean in slightly when saying the ChatGPT prompt details to create intimacy",
