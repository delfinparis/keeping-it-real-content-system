  "polished_script": "HOOK: You're not stuck because you don't know enough. You're stuck because you won't move. [ON-SCREEN: \"You won't move\"]\n\nBRAND INTRO: \"This is D.J. Paris with Keeping It Real Podcast, and this is your agent tip of the day.\"\n\nSETUP: You've got your license, you've watched the training videos, but you're still sitting there waiting to feel \"ready\" before you make that first call or knock that first door. [ON-SCREEN: \"Waiting to feel ready\"] Meanwhile, your pipeline stays empty and another month goes by without a closing. Sound familiar? \n[15-SEC RE-HOOK]: But here's what Connie Mahan—REALTOR of the Year in Central Florida—figured out that most agents never do.\n\nINSIGHT: Connie closed her first deal before she even finished her first training module. [ON-SCREEN: \"Closed BEFORE training ended\"] She says the best advice she ever got was this: \"Get in and do, and the rest will figure itself out.\" Not take another certification. Not perfect your scripts. DO. [ON-SCREEN: \"Get in and DO\"] She called expired listings with sweaty palms and half-written scripts. She door-knocked neighborhoods where she mispronounced street names. She hosted open houses where only two people showed up. And every single messy moment taught her more than any course ever could.\n\nREFRAME: Here's the truth: confidence doesn't create action—action creates confidence. [ON-SCREEN: \"Action creates confidence\"] The agent who makes fifty awkward calls will always outperform the one rehearsing the perfect pitch. You can start doing this today.\n\nCTA: \"Are you making calls this week, or are you still 'getting ready'—yes or no?\"\n\nCLOSE: \"See you next time.\"\n\n---\n\nCAPTION: Stop waiting to feel ready. REALTOR of the Year Connie Mahan closed deals before finishing training. Action beats preparation every time.\n\nHASHTAGS: #RealEstateAgent #RealtorTips #ActionOverPerfection #RealEstateSuccess #KeepingItRealPodcast\n\nSHAREABLE_MOMENT: \"Confidence doesn't create action—action creates confidence.\"\n\nPERFORMANCE_NOTES: \n1. Emphasize \"WON'T\" in the hook with a slight pause after\n2. Speed up during brand intro, then slow down for emotional connection in setup\n3. Direct eye contact and lean forward slightly during the reframe for maximum impact",

Added concrete examples in INSIGHT (sweaty palms, mispronounced streets, two-person open house) to make 'doing' visceral and relatable. Kept strongest line about confidence. Differentiated from Script 3 by focusing on Connie's specific messy first actions rather than general momentum philosophy.",
